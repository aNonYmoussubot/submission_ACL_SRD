        "abstract": "don't worry. it's totally natural. there's no mother ship hovering above the earth, waiting to carry you away, and no demon shooting light from beneath, signaling to pull you below. it's a light pillar or a few of them a colorful column of sparkling light that appears to beam up toward the sky. it's all just an icy illusion. and now, during winter, when nights are long and cold, you have a good chance to spot one as long as conditions are right. if you're lucky enough to spot a light pillar , what you're seeing is actually artificial light from a ground source reflecting off millions of floating ice crystals. \"it's not an upward beam of light,\" said les cowley, a physicist who runs a website on atmospheric optics, or the way light travels through the atmosphere. \"although they look pretty, they're also a sign that someone, somewhere could do better with their lighting. you might call them light pollution pillars if you wanted to be environmental about it.\" light pillars occur when ice-containing clouds normally miles high in the atmosphere cling closer to the earth's surface, just a hundred or a few thousand feet above it. these thin clouds contain millions of flat, hexagonal crystals of ice that float horizontally in the air each ice crystal acts like a mirror pointed downward, reflecting the artificial light back to your eyes as long as the cloud is about halfway between you and the light source. together, the crystals form a cluster of mirrors floating at different heights, which allows you to see the light as a column; if they all were at the same level, you'd see only a spot of light. the pillars can be quite colorful at times because each reflected beam is the same color as its source. image a light source, left, reflects off ice crystals in low clouds, creating the appearance of columns of light rising toward the sky. credit les cowley to find a good source one bright, close to the ground, and just far enough away your best bet is to travel a few miles outside your city or town on a dark night. the weather doesn't have to be frigid, but it helps. light pillars are frequently spotted in scandinavia, upstate new york, canada and other cold spots in the winter. but dr. cowley said that this week he received a photo of light pillars from about 30 miles outside of a town in iran perhaps because the desert can get cold at night. if leaving the city is not an option, look up at streetlights on a freezing cold night. you may spot the sparkly, ghostly blur of diamond dust . this illusion is created by the same flat ice crystals that produce light pillars, but this time, they're so low to the ground you can feel them prickling your skin. \"when that happens, you see other nearby halos, and it's quite a spectacular sight,\" dr. cowley said.",

        "title": "more connecticut schools fall short of 'no child left behind' standards.",
        "abstract": "since 2001, when president bush signed the federal no child left behind law, schools in connecticut have scrambled to revamp curriculums, step up professional development for teachers and continually assess students' test scores to comply with the law's requirements. it is an effort that has dominated the agendas of school officials not just in connecticut, but all over the nation, and not everyone is happy that test results have become such a focus. when results of the latest test scores were announced a few weeks ago, about 40 percent, or 408, of the public schools in connecticut did not make the grade under the federal law, state officials said. the state added 100 schools to its list of schools that failed to meet the federal benchmarks. mark k. mcquillan, commissioner of education for connecticut, said he does not believe the federal goals are attainable for connecticut schools. \"i think they're just unrealistic,\" he said in an interview last week. \"and the evidence shows that's true everywhere in the country. \"it's too much to expect of the country to do that kind of fundamental changing in the time frame and with the dollars they've provided,\" he said, referring to the federal government. the law calls for all students in the united states, including english language learners and students with special needs, to perform at grade level by 2014. some officials complain that because the standards are raised every two years, more and more schools are failing to fulfill the law's requirements. but that does not mean the state will not keep working hard to meet the goals, mr. mcquillan said. the state department of education has introduced a new accountability system that assigns teams and support personnel to struggling districts, and helps districts put improvement plans into action, state officials said. and the strategy is working in some districts. two elementary schools in norwalk found out that they had finally come off the list of schools \"in need of improvement.\" brookside elementary and kendall elementary schools were in a group of only five elementary schools statewide that improved enough to meet this year's standards. salvatore j. corda, superintendent of norwalk public schools, said the improvements came after systemic shifts in teaching and methodology that the district had been working on for a couple of years. \"when you try to move an entire system, it takes a while for things to take hold,\" he said. when tony ditrio took over as principal of kendall elementary school 10 years ago, his first piece of business was getting order in the building. \"there wasn't any,\" he said. \"that took a few years. once we had a safe, orderly environment, we started to tackle the curriculum.\" all of the most recent data is based on scores from testing of 230,000 third through eighth graders and 50,000 tenth graders last spring. the latest results show that keeping children reading at grade level is \"a real and growing challenge,\" mr. mcquillan said. at the high school level, he said, \"mathematics is the greater issue.\" this year, for the first time, the greenwich school district as a whole did not make adequate yearly progress. the district is one of 44 of the state's 171 districts that did not meet this year's standards. districts are considered not making adequate progress when certain student groups fail to meet benchmarks in the same category on both the elementary and high school tests. students with disabilities and economically disadvantaged students in greenwich did not score at grade level in both reading and math. \"does this mean we have a bad school system?\" said betty j. sternberg, superintendent of greenwich public schools. \"the strength of a school system does lie in meeting the needs of each child, no matter what their background is. so to that extent if i'm a parent of a child in a subgroup that hasn't met it,\" she said, referring to the standards, \"i would be concerned.\" special education students should not be expected to perform at grade level, dr. sternberg said. \"we've had reports of special ed students sitting in front of tests and they're crying. they can't possibly do it,\" she said. additionally, testing students every year between third and eighth grade leaves schools inundated with data that needs to be analyzed and reported, said dr. sternberg, who served as connecticut's commissioner for education from 2003 to 2006. while some teachers and school administrators complain about the tests, others say the law has forced them to take action. \"no child left behind has been a really good kick in the pants for us,\" said joshua p. starr, superintendent of schools in stamford. \"it was too easy to sweep some kids under the rug. we're not allowed to do that anymore, and that's a good thing.\" connecticut's attorney general, richard blumenthal, sued the bush administration in 2005, charging that no child left behind illegally requires states to spend their own money to meet the law's standards. a federal judge threw out the case last april, and mr. blumenthal is appealing that decision. the state's appeal is likely to be argued next spring, according to mr. blumenthal's staff.",

        "title": "mayor's report shows new york by the numbers.",
        "abstract": "there were more condoms handed out (39,070,000), more complaints about rats, roaches and other critters (23,000) and more potholes repaired (210,032). there were fewer homicides (516), fewer cars stolen (12,723) and fewer adults smoking (16.9 percent of the population). the numbers from the serious to the quirky and the surprising were among the more than 1,219 performance indicators included on wednesday in the mayor's management report , which assesses how city government responded in all areas during the past fiscal year compared with the previous year. it is an annual glimpse into what is and what is not working in this city of 8.2 million people and a sprawling bureaucracy of 300,000 public employees. in a statement, mayor michael r. bloomberg said that the report increased \"the transparency of city government,\" which he described as \"a critical part of our belief in accountability to the public.\" it has been released every year since 1977, as required by the city charter, but the mayor, who has an obsession of sorts with data and accountability, has compressed it significantly, turning an otherwise unwieldy document (it used to be as thick as an encyclopedia) into a manageable one (this year's has 220 pages). it offers an uneven mix of good and bad news, with more good than bad. in the realm of public health, for example, there were 3,305 new aids cases diagnosed among adults in the 2008 fiscal year, which ended on june 30. that is 410 fewer than in the previous fiscal year and 2,020 fewer than in the 2004 fiscal year. but new syphilis cases increased by 20 percent, which the report attributes largely to risky sexual behavior among men. this happened even though the city more than doubled the number of condoms it distributed during the same period. the buildings department, which experienced a rash of fatal construction accidents in the past year that heightened concerns about the public's safety and the quality of its inspectors, registered 25 fatalities in the 2008 fiscal year and 167 injuries, which is more than it had in either the 2006 or 2007 fiscal years, the only other years for which statistics were available. while there were about as many building inspections as there were in 2007, productivity fell to an average of 9.9 inspections per inspector per day, from 11.1 in 2007. that was because inspection requirements became more stringent and newly hired inspectors needed extra time to do the job, as the report indicates. new yorkers used more water in the 2008 fiscal year (about 139 gallons on average per person, per day) and called the city's 311 information system more than in any other fiscal year since 2004 (15 million times). children and adults visited public libraries more, and more of them joined recreation centers, largely because the city opened two new ones, on staten island and in queens. on the crime front, the news from the police department was generally favorable. last year, it registered fewer homicide reports, 516, or 41 fewer than in the previous fiscal year, as well as a decline in the reports of every other major felony crime, like rape, robbery and car thefts. at the same time, though, new york police officers were the subjects of 7,488 misconduct complaints 2 percent fewer than in the previous year, but the second-highest number of complaints since 2004. the verdict on city streets was also mixed. for the fourth year in a row, the annual rating of acceptable street cleanliness surpassed the 90 percent mark, traffic signals were fixed 70 percent faster than in the 2007 fiscal year and the city's network of bicycle lanes expanded by 70.6 miles. the quality of street pavement declined, though, and there were more potholes to be repaired. (a mayoral spokesman said that the increase could be attributed in part to a program that sends inspectors to find defects on the streets and report them to the city for repairs.) and it took the transportation department a bit longer, on average, to fix each pothole (2.7 days, as opposed to 2.1 days the previous year). in the midst of it all, what might be mr. bloomberg's proudest accomplishment was the decline in the number of smokers since he signed a bill raising cigarette taxes by $1.50 in 2002 and, a year later, banned smoking in the workplace, including restaurants and bars. in the 2007 calendar year, 16.9 percent of the city's adult population smoked, down from 21.5 percent in 2002. (smoking, unlike most of the measures tracked in the report, is tracked by calendar year rather than fiscal year.) the sharpest reduction happened on staten island, where the mayor was heckled once during a parade after the price of a pack of cigarettes reached the $7 mark. there, smokers made up 20.4 percent of the adult population in 2007, down from 27.2 percent in 2006.",

        "title": "senators fret over postal service's finances.",
        "abstract": "washington senators expressed mounting concern thursday about the worsening finances of the united states postal service, but fretted over proposals to save money by cutting service. the postal service lost $2.4 billion in the latest fiscal quarter, in addition to $2.3 billion in the first half of the fiscal year that began oct. 1. despite billions in cost reductions, the postal service projects a $7 billion loss for the year. the service has said that it will not be able to make legally required contributions to finance future retiree health benefits. the prepayments are a major drain on cash flow. the senate homeland security committee approved a bill by a vote of 11-1 last week that would give the postal service temporary relief from making full payments to the benefits fund. the legislation would also increase the postal service's authority to borrow. a bill altering how the postal service finances health benefits was approved by a house committee last month. \"unless we apply some tough medicine here and we do it working together, this dizzying downward spiral for the u.s. postal service could become a death spiral,\" said senator joseph i. lieberman, independent of connecticut, at a hearing of a homeland security subcommittee thursday. postmaster general john e. potter is recommending the closure of some postal facilities, as well as ending saturday deliveries. going to a five-day week would save more than $3 billion, according to mr. potter . the postal service expects to handle at least 27 billion fewer pieces of mail in 2009, on top of a drop of 9 billion last year, when it lost $2.8 billion. \"i think that we've reached a breaking point with the recession and that's why we're seeking to go from six- to five-day delivery,\" mr. potter said. senator thomas r. carper, democrat of delaware and chairman of the subcommittee, said that the health benefits bill was \"not a silver bullet.\" several senators said that eliminating a day of delivery was not off the table, but did not offer concrete proposals on how to make that change. \"often congress puts up roadblocks whenever the postal service mentions that it might be time to close or consolidate some facilities,\" mr. carper said. \"we just can't afford to do that anymore.\" mr. lieberman said that members of congress were opposed to closing postal facilities and eliminating a day of delivery but said, \"i fear that we'll probably have to do both of those.\" several members, however, have noted their constituents' opposition to the closure of postal units in their districts. currently, the post office is considering almost 700 postal stations and branches for consolidation or closure, though not all of them will close. \"the postal service cannot expect to gain more business, which it desperately needs, if it is reducing service,\" said susan m. collins, republican of maine. in an interview after the hearing, mr. potter said the postal service was working on a proposal to be filed with the postal regulatory commission this year that would outline five-day delivery. he said he also planned to seek permission from congress to pursue other lines of revenue generation besides mail.",

        "abstract": "mcallen, tex. the day after a federal appeals court cleared the way for texas' restrictive abortion law to take effect while it faces legal challenge, many clinics across the state said they had stopped providing abortions and were preparing to shut down, leaving women seeking their services distraught. \"patients are walking through the door, they are crying they are freaking out,\" said amy hagstrom miller, chief executive of whole woman's health , which operates six abortion facilities in texas and, she said, expects to close locations in fort worth, mcallen and san antonio. \"we can't stay open without any sources of income.\" the texas law, passed by the legislature in july, requires doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the procedure is performed, among other new rules. in september, a coalition of abortion rights groups, including planned parenthood, the american civil liberties union and the center for reproductive rights as well as clinics and doctors sued to stop the law. on monday, judge lee yeakel of united states district court in austin blocked enforcement of the law's requirement of physician-admitting privileges, saying it is \"without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\" on thursday, three judges on the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, in new orleans priscilla r. owen, jennifer walker elrod and catharina haynes allowed enforcement to begin . a 20-page opinion stated there was \"a substantial likelihood that the state will prevail,\" and that planned parenthood and the other plaintiffs had not proved that the restrictions would place an \"undue burden\" on women seeking abortions. all three appeals court judges were appointed by president george w. bush, as was judge yeakel. gov. rick perry of texas praised the ruling, saying that it \"affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of texas.\" ms. hagstrom miller said she and her staff were planning to help patients get transportation or provide gas cards so they could get to clinics that still provide abortions. she has been trying to get doctors accredited by hospitals, but said that the process is slow. some 30 miles away in harlingen, dr. lester minto, the physician and owner of reproductive services, said that in three decades of providing abortions he has stood up to protesters, at times numbering in the hundreds, who have picketed the clinic and frightened his patients. the new law, however, is a bigger obstacle. he said he has not been able to get admitting privileges from nearby hospitals. \"you can't fight austin,\" dr. minto said. on friday, patients came into the clinic for counseling and sonograms. \"they were all quite desperate and scared,\" he said. some told him they would travel to houston, more than 300 miles away; others told him they would go to mexico, where abortion-inducing drugs are widely available at pharmacies. at planned parenthood, a spokesman, eric ferrero, said that four of the organization's health centers in austin, fort worth, lubbock and waco would not be able to provide abortions under the new rules, but that those clinics will keep their doors open to provide other health services. the groups said they would continue to fight the texas law. \"this is far from over,\" mr. ferrero said. those opposing the law could petition the fifth circuit to ask that all of its judges reconsider the decision in a process known as en banc, or they might take the case directly to the supreme court. elizabeth graham, the director of texas right to life, said in a statement applauding the fifth circuit decision, \"our attorney general and his team have done a masterful job in defending house bill 2 and pursuing the law taking effect immediately.\" marni j. evans, a consultant on green building in austin, said she was scheduled to get an abortion on friday morning, but got a call from planned parenthood canceling her appointment. ms. evans said that she would fly to washington state, where she will stay with friends and get the procedure done. \"if i'm going to go through this process, which is pretty emotionally challenging, i'm going to go through it with the best possible care and the most supportive environment,\" she said. until the case works its way through the courts, much is uncertain, ms. hagstrom miller said. \"i'm not going to put a 'for sale' sign up on my building when i still have a patient in my parking lot but there will be a 'for sale' sign going up in mcallen very soon.\"",

        "abstract": "connecticut has become the most fascinating team in college basketball in march. no program flashes its range of extremes, from winning the n.c.a.a. tournament last season to a program that may be spiraling toward oblivion this year. with uconn led by the dazzling talents of the silky jeremy lamb and the boundless potential of the big man andre drummond, it is just as easy to see the huskies cutting down the nets again in april as it is to see a chain reaction of events that could include an n.c.a.a. tournament flop, an exodus of star players and the program's entering a cocoon of mediocrity because of its n.c.a.a. tournament ban in 2013 for poor academic performance. and there is the issue of the huskies' ailing coach, jim calhoun , who returned last week after back surgery and will turn 70 in may. will he decide to coach next season or will he be moved aside by university administrators? \"i'll start thinking about that once that final buzzer goes off in our last game,\" the freshman guard ryan boatright said, referring to possible changes next year. \"a lot can happen. you really can't focus on that right now. you have too much at stake and a great team.\" the huskies (20-13) fell to syracuse (31-1) in the quarterfinals of the big east tournament on thursday, squandering an 8-point second-half lead and succumbing to the deeper orange team, 58-55. uconn's two wins this week at madison square garden seemingly salvaged this bizarre season, in which connecticut went from a national title favorite to the country's biggest underachiever to a team just good enough to stumble into the n.c.a.a. tournament after losing 9 of 12 games over one stretch. but pity the no. 1 seed that sees uconn across from it in the second round of the tournament, as the huskies could be projected to be a no. 8 or a no. 9 seed. the only other teams with more than one projected n.b.a. lottery pick are north carolina and kentucky. the huskies certainly have their believers beyond n.b.a. general managers who are salivating over lamb and drummond. \"i think connecticut is a really good team; i would be shocked if they don't win two games in the n.c.a.a. tournament at the minimum,\" syracuse coach jim boeheim said. whenever and wherever the final buzzer sounds be it next week in the first round or at the final four in new orleans that is when the huskies will turn into college basketball's most watched drama. drummond, a 6-foot-10 freshman center, and lamb, a 6-5 sophomore shooting wing, are expected to enter the n.b.a. draft . and those expectations came long before the huskies were banned from the 2013 n.c.a.a. tournament. there is a chance that the junior big man alex oriakhi, who was uconn's best player in the national title game win over butler last season, could transfer for his final year. oriakhi could transfer without penalty because of the postseason ban, although he said he was not planning on it. drummond said, \"i'm not going to look into what happens in the future of the n.b.a. or anything right now.\" calhoun has told the connecticut news media that \"this is my team\" and indicated that he had no immediate plans to leave. \"i haven't made any plans to do anything else, except my back and a few other things have got in the way,\" calhoun said. since uconn won the national title while on probation last year, it has bumbled through an embarrassing time. soon after the new university president, susan herbst, arrived, she aligned herself with calhoun and ran off athletic director jeff hathaway. while hathaway had his flaws, the move was widely perceived as herbst's succumbing to calhoun's wishes. uconn then mocked the n.c.a.a. by recruiting drummond late in the summer despite having no scholarships left. (drummond is reportedly paying his own way this year.) the decision to accept drummond danced all over the spirit of the n.c.a.a.'s probation and scholarship restrictions, yet no one at uconn dared suggest calhoun do anything different. from there, herbst and uconn desperately pleaded for a spot in the atlantic coast conference, or any other league, once the madness of realignment hit in september. their pleas fell on deaf ears, a cold reality check to their open-market value. then the n.c.a.a. ruling came down (the university is appealing), calhoun's back ailment sidelined him and uconn looked so bad on the court that espn announcers openly mocked the team's lack of effort in a blowout loss at louisville. calhoun returned, but his career mortality seems more evident. this is the third season that he has missed games with a health problem. the sun is clearly setting on calhoun's career, and the question is whether the university will nudge him out or work with him to devise an exit plan before the lost season of 2012-13 looms. the new athletic director, warde manuel, who will start march 19, pointed out that he played for the michigan football coach bo schembechler, who had two heart attacks. \"there's no nudging,\" manuel said of calhoun. \"that's not where we are. i don't walk in there with that mind-set of nudging on making any decisions about his future.\" calhoun was typical blustery calhoun this week, a fireball of sarcasm, defiance and run-on-sentences. he did everything from tweaking iona coach tim cluess for daring to question the big east's superiority to sniping at uconn beat writers for daring to mention the team's losing streaks. that's all calhoun has known for 26 years. and when the final buzzer sounds on this most combustible of uconn teams, everything or nothing could change.",

        "title": "as child migrants flood to border, u.s. presses latin america to act.",
        "abstract": "mexico city faced with an unprecedented surge of child migrants from central america that is overwhelming shelters and jails in texas and arizona, the united states has begun pushing for stronger regional cooperation to arrest the flow and enable the children's safe return. vice president joseph r. biden jr. arrives friday in guatemala to meet with the presidents of that country and of el salvador, as well as senior officials from honduras and mexico, to help highlight warnings about the dangers of crossing mexico and the united states border, as well as the futility of trying to obtain legal status without a proper visa. mr. biden also plans to announce ways to better address the crime rattling the nations that is contributing to the exodus. both issues have long made for complicated, and at times tense, relations between the united states, mexico and central america, and mr. biden's visit puts the matter front and center. the countries largely blame the united states for failing to revamp laws to better regulate migration and for the drug trade that has stoked the violence on their streets. ahead of the meeting, president obama called president enrique pena nieto of mexico on thursday afternoon \"to discuss the urgent humanitarian issue,\" according to a white house statement, \"and welcomed the opportunity to work in close cooperation with mexico to develop concrete proposals to address the root causes of unlawful migration from central america. he also discussed the united states and mexico's shared responsibility for promoting security in both countries and in the region.\" from october to june 15, 52,000 unaccompanied children were caught at the american border with mexico border, twice the number for the same period in the previous year. migration from central america has been rising as young people seek to escape gang and other violence, but the sudden spike has been attributed in part to rumors that the united states would grant leniency to those who cross the border. guatemala, honduras, el salvador and mexico, while expressing sympathy for the plight of the children, until now have treated the migration with far less urgency and have focused their diplomatic efforts on pushing for better conditions for the detained children, rather than on halting the flow in the first place. the honduran foreign minister, mireya aguero de corrales, this week suggested minors from her country should be granted special status to stay in the united states with family members on humanitarian grounds, even as the obama administration has tried to dispel any notion that would occur. the president of guatemala, too, renewed a call that had already been rejected for guatemalans in the united states without proper visas to be granted \"temporary protected status\" allowing them to live and work. mexico, declaring that migration problems are a matter of \"shared responsibility\" with neighboring countries, has not unveiled any new initiative to halt the notoriously free flow of migrants across its southern border or to address the hundreds of people who openly stow away on a crime-ridden freight train known as \"la bestia,\" or the beast. \"there is a sense the problem is really terrible and shameful, but there is not much of sense they are going to do much new,\" said eric olson, associate director of the latin america program at the woodrow wilson center, who is in honduras researching the american approach to public security in the region. while corruption and spotty, lackluster efforts at law enforcement and border control have not helped, the countries tend to view the violence that is propelling people north as a byproduct of american drug consumption, with multinational trafficking organizations using their countries as staging grounds and transit points for the illegal drugs that americans demand. in addition, central american nations lament that economic development assistance has taken a back seat to immigration. they also denounce the emphasis on deportation, saying it results in the return of street gang members who then resume their acts of terror against law-abiding citizens in some of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. it is not clear what new aid the united states might provide the countries to curb the violence or improve economic conditions. in general the approach has been trade agreements and limited economic programs that have not lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty. and the united states lately has been eschewing short-term, get-tough strategies that put soldiers on the streets, instead favoring crime prevention programs and training sessions for the police, prosecutors and judges in an effort to shore up weak institutions. about $642 million has been designated for anti-crime aid to the region since 2008 under a program known as carsi, for the central american regional security initiative, but congressional overseers have given the program mixed reports and said its successes are difficult to measure. \"although congress first appropriated funding for carsi nearly six years ago, little information is available about the results of the initiative thus far,\" said a report from the congressional research service in may. \"u.s. agencies reportedly monitor and report on carsi through internal channels, but they have not publicly released the metrics used to assess the initiative's performance.\" hector silva avalos, a former salvadoran diplomat and now a scholar at american university who is studying the migration crisis, said carsi had failed to stem violence or put a dent in the flow of drugs. that, he said, has caused el salvador and guatemala to consider or propose unorthodox approaches to reducing violence. a gang truce that began two years ago in el salvador with the government's support initially helped reduce the number of murders, but the truce has since crumbled and violence is rising again there. in guatemala, president otto perez molina has suggested legalizing narcotics as an alternative, but he has not taken steps toward such a move, and some analysts believe he is raising the prospect to pressure american officials to fully restore military aid suspended decades ago during the country's civil war. \"because of frustration with the circumstances, central america has felt more empowered to talk back,\" mr. avalos said. \"it is good for politics there, but not really for policy.\" honduras, the most violent of the nations and the source of a great number of the migrants, has proposed a militarized approach to fighting crime, but the united states, while still working closely with certain police units, has balked at some of the steps taken by the country's new president. the united states stopped its assistance in tracking drug planes with radar after honduras adopted a law allowing its forces to shoot down suspect civilian aircraft, a tactic that violates the terms of american foreign assistance. the united states has also threatened to withdraw help to repair honduras's fighter jets. the united states temporarily halted drug aid for four months in 2012 after the honduran military shot down two civilian planes. president juan orlando hernandez of honduras has rebuked the united states for its position. in a sign of the tensions the matter has provoked, he is attending the world cup in brazil and plans to skip the meeting of the other nations and mr. biden in guatemala. \"either you are helping us or you are not going to continue to do so, but it is good to know,\" mr. hernandez said at a police ceremony in march, with the american ambassador seated before him. he went on to thank countries for helping the effort to curtail the violence, but said \"clearly some should be helping more than others.\" mr. olson, the latin america expert, said, \"right now in honduras in a lot of ways the u.s. and honduras are not on the same page when it comes to public security.\" the united states has continued to assist in intercepting boats in honduras, which officials say carry 80 to 90 percent of the drugs into the country. and honduras has found other ways to support its military approach: it has bought radar from israel and mr. hernandez has sought agreements with brazil to repair its air force jets. \"they may see us a small, they may see us as poor but we are people with dignity who are going to press forward no matter the cost,\" mr. hernandez said at the police ceremony.",

        "abstract": "on a sunday morning last summer, fabian cervantes walked through the doors of our lady of refuge, the roman catholic church in brooklyn that he had lost hope of ever seeing again. his arms were pale from seven months in jail. his clothes hung limply because he had lost 25 pounds. his sallow eyes attested to scores of sleepless nights. he picked his way up the central aisle, passing the regulars at the 8:30 a.m. spanish-language mass, the people who had prayed for him. then, from the altar, he began to tell the story of his return. his best friend in the congregation, sammy cruz, considered it a miracle, one that he believed had something to do with the way he and mr. cervantes had restored every single pew in the church. when did the story begin? on the day in early 2003 when mr. cervantes walked across the desert from mexico into the united states? the bitter february night, his first in new york, when he wound up sleeping in the subway? the day when that colombian man took pity on him and offered him a job and a basement bed? the day when he happened to walk past our lady of refuge and heard spanish being spoken and went inside to give thanks? however mr. cervantes's odyssey started, by the summer of 2010 he had created a stable life for himself, or at least as stable a life as an immigrant without papers can have. he had an apartment of his own. he worked steadily in construction sometimes carpentry, sometimes drywall for $70 a day, and on those modest wages, he managed to send $300 a month to relatives back home. during that summer, the pastor of our lady of refuge, the rev. michael a. perry, mentioned that he wanted to fix the pews. there were 37 rows, installed when the church had been built 76 years earlier, and their original oak was by this time hidden beneath seven coats of paint. that paint, in turn, was cracked and chipped and water-damaged. mr. perry had gotten an estimate for restoration: $100,000, way beyond anything a parish of working-class immigrants could afford. \"tell father perry this is nothing,\" mr. cervantes, 50, told mr. cruz, a retired sanitation worker. \"i can do this.\" so mr. cervantes and mr. cruz undertook the work. they began at 6 most weeknights, after mr. cervantes had finished his construction work. they finished as late as 2 the next morning. sometimes they had a dozen other volunteers. often, they had just each other. six rows each night, they did battle with the accreted paint, going at it with coarse 60-grit sandpaper, then 120-grit to level out the worst gouges, then 220-grit to smooth the surface for coatings of stain and shellac. the accumulated dust filled two garbage bags every shift. \"this is rough,\" mr. cervantes said one time to mr. cruz. \"we can't stop now,\" mr. cruz replied. they did not stop until nov. 29, 2011, barely a week before their target date, the parish's 100th anniversary, on dec. 8. (the original frame building was replaced in 1934 by the current church, at foster and ocean avenues in the flatbush neighborhood, built of granite in the french gothic style.) the oak pews gleamed golden, never more so than on the december day when mexican immigrants like mr. cervantes celebrated the feast of our lady of guadalupe. a few weeks later, he traveled back to mexico to buy a car, which he needed to get to construction jobs. passing outside pittsburgh on the way east, his car collided with another. when the police came and asked for his license, mr. cervantes had to admit he had none. registration? none. passport? none. he went to the allegheny county jail, the holding pen for nearly 3,000 people accused of crimes ranging from public intoxication to murder. mr. cervantes's otherwise minor offense, driving without a license, looked more than sufficient for him to be deported. father perry, the pastor, and the jail's catholic chaplain, deacon thomas j. o'neill, tried to find an immigration lawyer to take the case. the required retainer, about $6,000, far exceeded anything mr. cervantes or his four grown daughters, two of whom have moved to new york, could pay. so his case fell to a public defender, amy lindberg, and the congregation at our lady of refuge raised $500 for mr. cervantes's seat on a deportation flight. after a brief hearing in late july 2012, the county court found mr. cervantes guilty on the charge of driving without a license. he was remanded to an immigration detention center in pittsburgh to await the forced repatriation. then something unexpected happened, something for which nobody not mr. cervantes, father perry, deacon o'neill or ms. lindberg has a firm legal explanation. the immigration authorities released mr. cervantes. as best anyone involved in the case can surmise, the officials were using the discretion given to them by president obama under a policy change announced in august 2011. it permitted immigration prosecutors to suspend deportation proceedings against immigrants whose sole crime was being in the united states illegally. outside the detention center, mr. cervantes dropped to his knees beside a tree and prayed. during his months in jail, he had read the bible, turning repeatedly to the story of joseph joseph sold into slavery by his brothers, joseph miraculously redeemed. on the next sunday, he walked into our lady of refuge, a kind of joseph. this week, a free man, he again marked the feast of our lady of guadalupe. and he kept a particular promise. \"do you really like god?\" mr. cruz had asked him once during the months of captivity. \"yes,\" mr. cervantes had replied. \"then pray to him,\" mr. cruz said. \"he's the best lawyer you could have.\"",

        "title": "chinese christians defend persecuted underground church.",
        "abstract": "beijing more than a dozen christian leaders in china have thrown their support behind an embattled underground church, calling for the government to end its persecution and for broader religious freedoms as well. their petition, a rare public gesture for religious figures, who are often wary of wading into politics, raises the stakes in a standoff that has drawn concern from christian groups outside china and prompted a separate petition campaign in the united states and canada. nineteen pastors signed the petition , delivered wednesday to the national people's congress, china's legislature, and posted on the internet. it calls for legal protections for so-called house churches, which operate illicitly outside the government-run religious system. the petition also calls on the legislature to investigate the crackdown on one such church, shouwang, an evangelical protestant congregation whose leaders have been under house arrest for more than a month. the church and its 1,000 members became homeless in early april after the landlord, under pressure from the authorities, canceled its lease. since then, the parishioners have tried to pray outdoors each sunday, prompting a predictable cat-and-mouse game with the police, who prevent some members from leaving their homes and round up those who manage to reach the predetermined place of worship. carsten vala, an expert on chinese christianity at loyola university maryland, said the petition ratcheted up pressure on the ruling communist party at a time when it was increasingly nervous about perceived challenges to its authority. \"this shows there is national attention to what's happening to shouwang and that there is connection among urban house churches across the country,\" he said. the petition blames an \"outdated system of religion management\" for a crisis that is stirring up the tens of millions of chinese believers who have come to place more faith in christianity than in the atheist communist party. it also suggests that such policies will invariably lead to more social strife, the very thing chinese leaders are so eager to avoid. \"we hope that by setting up a special investigation commission, the government will be able to handle the shouwang incident in a rational and wise manner on basis of the principles of 'putting people first and ruling the country by law' and in the gracious spirit of serving the citizens, so as to avoid the escalation of the conflict between state and church,\" the petition says, quoting a common slogan of the current leadership. the document was written by xie moshan and li tianen, patriarchs of the house church movement, who have each spent more than a decade in chinese prisons. the persecution of shouwang and a number of other unregistered churches coincides with a wider clampdown in china , fueled by unrest in the arab world, which has led to the detention of scores of dissidents, rights lawyers and other perceived critics. like many unofficial churches, shouwang started out in a private home, but in recent years it has become one of the capital's largest and most affluent congregations. in 2009, after a previous eviction forced the church to worship in a park, parishioners donated more than $4 million to purchase a space of their own. but despite having a deed in hand, the church has not been permitted by the government to occupy the space, a conflict that led to the current crisis. at a regular news conference on thursday, jiang yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, defended the campaign against shouwang, saying that congregants had tried repeatedly to \"gather illegally in the streets,\" according to reuters. \"to maintain public order and security, the public security departments have taken the appropriate measures,\" she said.",

        "title": "martin nowak - in games, an insight into the rules of evolution.",
        "abstract": "when martin nowak was in high school, his parents thought he would be a nice boy and become a doctor. but when he left for the university of vienna, he abandoned medicine for something called biochemistry. as far as his parents could tell, it had something to do with yeast and fermenting. they became a little worried. when their son entered graduate school, they became even more worried. he announced that he was now studying games. in the end, dr. nowak turned out all right. he is now the director of the program for evolutionary dynamics at harvard. the games were actually versatile mathematical models that dr. nowak could use to make important discoveries in fields as varied as economics and cancer biology. \"martin has a passion for taking informal ideas that people like me find theoretically important and framing them as mathematical models,\" said steven pinker, a harvard linguist who is collaborating with dr. nowak to study the evolution of language. \"he allows our intuitions about what leads to what to be put to a test.\" on the surface, dr. nowak's many projects may seem randomly scattered across the sciences. but there is an underlying theme to his work. he wants to understand one of the most puzzling yet fundamental features of life: cooperation. when biologists speak of cooperation, they speak more broadly than the rest of us. cooperation is what happens when someone or something gets a benefit because someone or something else pays a cost. the benefit can take many forms, like money or reproductive success. a friend takes off work to pick you up from the hospital. a sterile worker bee tends to eggs in a hive. even the cells in the human body cooperate. rather than reproducing as fast as it can, each cell respects the needs of the body, helping to form the heart, the lungs or other vital organs. even the genes in a genome cooperate, to bring an organism to life. in recent papers, dr. nowak has argued that cooperation is one of the three basic principles of evolution. the other two are mutation and selection. on their own, mutation and selection can transform a species, giving rise to new traits like limbs and eyes. but cooperation is essential for life to evolve to a new level of organization. single-celled protozoa had to cooperate to give rise to the first multicellular animals. humans had to cooperate for complex societies to emerge. \"we see this principle everywhere in evolution where interesting things are happening,\" dr. nowak said. while cooperation may be central to evolution, however, it poses questions that are not easy to answer. how can competing individuals start to cooperate for the greater good? and how do they continue to cooperate in the face of exploitation? to answer these questions, dr. nowak plays games. his games are the intellectual descendants of a puzzle known as the prisoner's dilemma. imagine two prisoners are separately offered the same deal: if one of them testifies and the other doesn't talk, the talker will go free and the holdout will go to jail for 10 years. if both refuse to talk, the prosecutor will only be able to put them in jail for six months. if each prisoner rats out the other, they will both get five-year sentences. not knowing what the other prisoner will do, how should each one act? the way the prisoner's dilemma pits cooperation against defection distills an important feature of evolution. in any encounter between two members of the same species, each one may cooperate or defect. certain species of bacteria, for example, spray out enzymes that break down food, which all the bacteria can then suck up. it costs energy to make these enzymes. if one of the microbes stops cooperating and does not make the enzymes, it can still enjoy the meal. it can gain a potential reproductive edge over bacteria that cooperate. the prisoner's dilemma may be abstract, but that's why dr. nowak likes it. it helps him understand fundamental rules of evolution, just as isaac newton discovered that objects in motion tend to stay in motion. \"if you were obsessed with friction, you would have never discovered this law,\" dr. nowak said. \"in the same sense, i try to get rid of what is inessential to find the essential. truth is simple.\" dr. nowak found his first clues to the origin of cooperation in graduate school, collaborating with his ph.d. adviser, karl sigmund. they built a version of the prisoner's dilemma that captured more of the essence of how organisms behave and evolve. in their game, an entire population of players enters a round-robin competition. the players are paired up randomly, and each one chooses whether to cooperate or defect. to make a choice, they can recall their past experiences with other individual players. some players might use a strategy in which they had a 90-percent chance of cooperating with a player with whom they have cooperated in the past. the players get rewarded based on their choices. the most successful players get to reproduce. each new player had a small chance of randomly mutating its strategy. if that strategy turned out to be more successful, it could dominate the population, wiping out its ancestors. dr. nowak and dr. sigmund observed this tournament through millions of rounds. often the winners used a strategy that dr. nowak called, \"win-stay, lose-shift.\" if they did well in the previous round, they did the same thing again. if they did not do so well, they shifted. under some conditions, this strategy caused cooperation to become common among the players, despite the short-term payoff of defecting. in order to study this new version of the prisoner's dilemma, dr. nowak had to develop new mathematical tools. it turned out that these tools also proved useful for studying cancer. cancer and the prisoner's dilemma may seem like apples and oranges, but dr. nowak sees an intimate connection between the two. \"cancer is a breakdown of cooperation,\" he said. mutations sometimes arise in cells that cause them to replicate quickly, ignoring signals to stop. some of their descendants acquire new mutations, allowing them to become even more successful as cancer cells. they evolve, in other words, into more successful defectors. \"cancer is an evolution you don't want,\" dr. nowak said. to study cancer, however, dr. nowak had to give his models some structure. in the prisoner's dilemma, the players usually just bump into each other randomly. in the human body, on the other hand, cells only interact with cells in their neighborhood. a striking example of these neighborhoods can be found in the intestines, where the lining is organized into millions of tiny pockets. a single stem cell at the bottom of a pocket divides, and its daughter cells are pushed up the pocket walls. the cells that reach the top get stripped away. dr. nowak adapted a branch of mathematics known as graph theory, which makes it possible to study networks, to analyze how cancer arises in these local neighborhoods. \"our tissue is actually organized to delay the onset of cancer,\" he said. pockets of intestinal cells, for example, can only hold a few cell generations. that lowers the chances that any one will turn cancerous. all the cells in each pocket are descended from a single stem cell, so that there's no competition between lineages to take over the pocket. as dr. nowak developed this neighborhood model, he realized it would help him study human cooperation. \"the reality is that i'm much more likely to interact with my friends, and they're much more likely to interact with their friends,\" dr. nowak said. \"so it's more like a network.\" dr. nowak and his colleagues found that when they put players into a network, the prisoner's dilemma played out differently. tight clusters of cooperators emerge, and defectors elsewhere in the network are not able to undermine their altruism. \"even if outside our network there are cheaters, we still help each other a lot,\" dr. nowak said. that is not to say that cooperation always emerges. dr. nowak identified the conditions when it can arise with a simple equation: b/c>k. that is, cooperation will emerge if the benefit-to-cost (b/c) ratio of cooperation is greater than the average number of neighbors (k). \"it's the simplest possible thing you could have expected, and it's completely amazing,\" he said. another boost for cooperation comes from reputations. when we decide whether to cooperate, we don't just rely on our past experiences with that particular person. people can gain reputations that precede them. dr. nowak and his colleagues pioneered a version of the prisoner's dilemma in which players acquire reputations. they found that if reputations spread quickly enough, they could increase the chances of cooperation taking hold. players were less likely to be fooled by defectors and more likely to benefit from cooperation. in experiments conducted by other scientists with people and animals, dr. nowak's mathematical models seem to fit. reputation has a powerful effect on how people play games. people who gain a reputation for not cooperating tend to be shunned or punished by other players. cooperative players get rewarded. \"you help because you know it gives you a reputation of a helpful person, who will be helped,\" dr. nowak said. \"you also look at others and help them according to whether they have helped.\" the subject of human cooperation is important not just to mathematical biologists like dr. nowak, but to many people involved in the current debate over religion and science. some claim that it is unlikely that evolution could have produced humans' sense of morality, the altruism of heroes and saints. \"selfless altruism presents a major challenge for the evolutionist,\" dr. francis s. collins, the director of the national human genome research institute, wrote in his 2006 book, \"the language of god.\" dr. nowak believes evolutionary biologists should study average behavior rather than a few extreme cases of altruism. \"saintly behavior is unfortunately not the norm,\" dr. nowak said. \"the current theory can certainly explain a population where some people act extremely altruistically.\" that does not make dr. nowak an atheist, however. \"evolution describes the fundamental laws of nature according to which god chose to unfold life,\" he declared in march in a lecture titled \"evolution and christianity\" at the harvard divinity school. dr. nowak is collaborating with theologians there on a project called \"the evolution and theology of cooperation,\" to help theologians address evolutionary biology in their own work. dr. nowak sometimes finds his scientific colleagues astonished when he defends religion. but he believes the astonishment comes from a misunderstanding of the roles of science and religion. \"like mathematics, many theological statements do not need scientific confirmation. once you have the proof of fermat's last theorem, it's not like we have to wait for the scientists to tell us if it's right. this is it.\"",

        "abstract": "kansas city, mo., jan. 9 - make his tie green instead of red and put the room at hofstra university instead of arrowhead stadium. this could have been a herman edwards news conference with the jets. edwards stood behind a lectern monday afternoon and invoked the familiar themes from his five seasons in new york: faith, trust, integrity, sacrifice, commitment and accountability. he addressed reporters as \"sir\" and \"ma'am\" and seemed to have an answer for everything, except what everyone wanted to know: why was he here, being introduced as the kansas city chiefs' head coach, just six days after saying, \"i intend to be back as the jets' coach\"? before taking questions, edwards said he would not discuss his departure from the jets, who on friday accepted a fourth-round draft choice in exchange for letting edwards out of the final two years of his contract. \"i believe in family,\" edwards said. \"and what happened in new york stays in new york. so if you ask any questions about what happened, i'll tell you right now, it stays in the family. \"i learned a long time ago, what stays in your house stays in your house. it's in that house, and i threw the key away.\" when edwards did speak about the jets and new york, it was only in positive terms. as his wife, lia, held their 5-month-old daughter, gabrielle, in her lap, edwards thanked the jets' owner, woody johnson, for hiring him and for letting him return to kansas city, where he served as an assistant coach and scout from 1990 to 1995. \"i owe a debt of gratitude to woody johnson,\" edwards said. \"he gave a young coach a chance to be a head coach when maybe a lot of people wouldn't do that. i thank him for that, and i thank the organization for that. \"and i thank my players my last five years in new york for making me a better man. i hope i made a difference, and i hope i make a difference here.\" edwards agreed to a four-year deal reportedly worth $12 million, about $1 million more a season than he made with the jets. with the jets, he was among the lower-paid head coaches in the n.f.l. job security may have been a bigger concern for him. though the jets extended his contract twice, the second time after the 2003 season, edwards faced an uncertain future. if the jets struggled again next season -- a strong possibility with workhorse back curtis martin and quarterback chad pennington coming off injuries -- edwards would enter the final year of his contract as a lame duck. the jets' 4-12 mark this season dropped his record as coach below .500, at 39-41. but he departed as the only jets coach to make the playoffs three times, and his 39 victories tied walt michaels for third in team history. edwards's news conference concluded a tumultuous final six days to his jets career. dick vermeil announced his retirement as head coach on jan. 2, and the chiefs' president, carl peterson, said jets general manager terry bradway called the next day to ask if he was interested in talking to edwards. that was the day edwards said he was staying. then the jets agreed to release edwards from his contract. peterson's relationship with edwards goes back to 1972, when peterson, then an assistant at u.c.l.a., recruited edwards out of high school. edwards spurned the bruins for cal. \"i was a little bit of a rebel,\" edwards said. five years later, when he was philadelphia's director of player personnel, peterson signed edwards, a defensive back, as a rookie free agent. peterson became the chiefs' president in december 1988, and the next year edwards joined the team as part of the n.f.l.'s minority coaching fellowship program, becoming a scout in 1990. edwards is believed to be the first graduate of the program to become head coach of the team he served. \"i have waited to do this for a long time,\" peterson said. \"i was very fortunate. i got to hire the guy who hired me, dick vermeil. and we had the opportunity to hire somebody we've known for a long time.\" vermeil was 44-36 in five seasons, but kansas city had only two winning records in that time and one playoff appearance, losing to indianapolis, 38-31, in a divisional game in the 2003 season. edwards inherits a team that finished 10-6 and missed the playoffs despite having the top-ranked offense in the league, led by running back larry johnson (1,750 yards, 20 touchdowns), the seven-time pro bowl tight end tony gonzalez and an offensive line that landed three players in the pro bowl. \"i think they upgraded the act,\" vermeil said. \"he's getting a better team. that doesn't guarantee anything, but the talent level here is far superior than when i got here.\"",

        "abstract": "washington the capital region's subway system has failed to adequately learn from a series of dangerous and sometimes fatal episodes in recent years, making \"little or no progress\" toward instituting a culture of safety, the national transportation safety board concluded on tuesday. the assessment came as the board discussed the findings of a more than yearlong investigation into a fatal instance of smoke filling a tunnel in january 2015. its conclusion painted the most complete picture to date of the how the aging infrastructure, flawed safety response and inadequate local and federal oversight combined to cause the event, which killed one person and injured 91 others. but the investigation also allowed the board members to express concerns about how the nation's second busiest subway system has acted or not acted to address prominent safety lapses. \"when the n.t.s.b. finds itself issuing a continuous stream of accident reports to address the basic safety management of a single transit rail system, something is fundamentally flawed,\" christopher a. hart, the board's chairman, said. \"here, that something is safety oversight.\" image a metro station after it was evacuated in january 2015 when smoke filled a tunnel, killing one person. credit manuel balce ceneta/associated press the report came as the newly installed managers of the transit agency, known here as metro, grapple with several high-profile setbacks and continuing funding woes facing the system. the n.t.s.b. members acknowledged that metro, under that leadership, appeared now to be taking steps in the right direction and offered more than 30 recommendations to the authorities involved in the incident, primarily involving maintenance and safety training. they also renewed their criticism of the federal transit administration, which has overseen the system's safety since october, arguing that it does not have the ability, the experience or the disciplinary authority to do its job adequately. instead, mr. hart and other board members said, metro should be reclassified as a commuter rail system and its oversight moved to the better-established federal railroad administration until authorities here conclude their long-stalled efforts to create a federally approved local safety oversight body. that suggestion prompted a response after the meeting from secretary of transportation anthony foxx, who defended the f.t.a. in a letter released to the board and said it should continue its oversight of metro. though many of the investigation's findings were forecast in a preliminary report in the days after the smoke event and during investigative hearings last june, the final report gave a step-by-step account of what went wrong and who was to blame. image a smoke inhalation victim, one of the 91 people who were injured in the smoke accident in 2015. credit paul j. richards/a.f.p. getty images investigators concluded that the jan. 12, 2015, episode was caused by \"a prolonged short circuit that consumed power system components\" that had been allowed to lapse under \"ineffective inspection and maintenance practices.\" water that contaminated the faulted cable, a dearth of smoke detectors in metro's tunnels, ventilation fans that did not work properly, and staff that was not trained in how to use them exacerbated the problem, the n.t.s.b. said. the board also said that city fire and emergency services were not prepared to respond to such an event. \"whatever could go wrong that afternoon did go wrong,\" robert l. sumwalt, a member of the board, said, while questioning n.t.s.b. investigators. \"to quote a shakespearean play, it was a comedy of errors. except, it was not funny.\" n.t.s.b. members made frequent comparisons to conclusions reached in a similar investigation after a 2009 train collision that killed nine people near the city's outskirts. top metro officials attended tuesday's meeting. paul j. wiedefeld, its new general manager, is expected to announce a systemwide maintenance plan in the coming weeks. and on monday, in advance of the safety board's report, metro took steps to address at least one of its concerns, announcing that it would station a fire department official at its operations control center at all times to help coordinate emergency responses.",

        "abstract": "washington united states marshals made a gruesome discovery on wednesday when they went to evict banita m. jacks from her home the decomposed bodies of ms. jacks's four daughters. on thursday, the authorities charged ms. jacks, 33, with murdering the girls, ages 5, 6, 11 and 17. if convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole. investigators said that ms. jacks denied killing her daughters and claimed they had been possessed by demons. the victims, dead for as long as eight months, were found in two bedrooms on the second floor of a row house in washington highlands, a neighborhood in the southeast part of the city. according to a court document, the three youngest girls, aja fogle, 5, n'kiah fogle, 6, and tatianna jacks, 11, were found face down in an unfurnished bedroom, clad only in white t-shirts. the preliminary medical examiner's report said aja appeared to have died from a blow to the back of the head and strangulation. n'kiah and tatianna also appeared to have been strangled, the report said. the naked body of the girls' older sister, brittany jacks, 17, was discovered by marshals in a second bedroom, and the medical examiner found what appeared to be three stab wounds on her body. at a news conference on thursday, the medical examiner, dr. marie-lydie y. pierre-louis, said that based on the decomposition of the bodies, she could not pinpoint when the girls died, but the court document said that they might have been dead since may. investigators said ms. jacks had told them that she stopped feeding her children and that all of them, starting with her youngest daughter, had died in their sleep over a period of a week to 10 days before her electricity was turned off. investigators say that the local power company, pepco, shut the power off on sept. 5. at a hearing on thursday in district of columbia superior court, the prosecution argued that ms. jacks should be held without bail, but a defense lawyer asked that she be released into the custody of a male adult relative until her trial. labeling it a horrendous situation, magistrate judge karen a. howze called a brief recess on thursday evening before ruling that ms. jacks be detained pending the preliminary hearing, scheduled for feb. 11. at the news conference, mayor adrian m. fenty promised a full investigation into the deaths, including the conduct of welfare agencies and school officials. there had been at least one contact between ms. jacks and child welfare services and another between her and the metropolitan police department, mayor fenty said, but he declined to elaborate. \"i don't think anyone in the city can remember a case involving this many young people who have died in such a tragic way,\" he said. ms. jacks's home is in the city's poorest ward, which is represented by washington's former mayor and current councilman, marion s. barry jr. \"how could this not have been detected by some school officials somewhere?\" mr. barry asked at the news conference, where he also called for a tightening of school attendance laws.",

        "title": "pervasive abuse found in belgian catholic church.",
        "abstract": "brussels sexual abuse of children reached all parts of belgium 's roman catholic church , and it drove at least 13 victims to kill themselves, a report released friday said. the report, put forth by a commission established by the church itself, sketched the harrowing dimensions of priestly abuse over five decades, listing cases involving 327 male complainants and 161 women, and 19 cases in which the gender of the victim was unclear. in one case the abuse began when a child was just 2 years old. the report was the latest blow to a church reeling from a sexual scandal that worsened after the bishop of bruges, roger vangheluwe , resigned in april after admitting that he had abused a boy who was later identified as his nephew. the resignation prompted more than 200 victims to come forward within a few days with complaints about abuses by priests, in some cases dating back many decades. one complainant is more than 90 years old. those victims' stories, compiled in the report, reveal in detail their suffering. many say they are still fighting illness and depression many years after the abuses. \"i had massive depressions, including one which took me to attempted suicide,\" wrote one victim. another wrote, \"my life has been essentially nothing but running away, surrender, solitude, sickness, humiliation, tears, silence, mistrust and regrets.\" the report amounts to the final act of the commission, led by peter adriaenssens, a prominent psychiatrist. the commission decided to stop its work after the belgian police confiscated its documents in a series of high-profile raids on church property in june in search of proof of sexual abuse or of a cover-up by the church. at the same time, the police searched the headquarters of the catholic church in mechelen, disturbing the tomb of a cardinal in an unsuccessful hunt for documents, and prompting criticism from pope benedict xvi . seizures made by the police were ruled inadmissible this week by the country's court of appeal. belgian law prevents the police from investigating complaints about events that happened more than 10 years ago, and the commission was set up to try to deal with cases that are too old for legal action. dr. adriaenssens said the number of cases multiplied after several abusers were interviewed for the report. \"we saw how priests, called up by the commission and asked to help seek the truth, were willing to set up the list of 10, 15, 20 victims they abused during boarding school while the commission knew only of one,\" he said, according to the bbc . jurgen mettepenningen, spokesman for the belgian church, declined to comment on the report. on monday the church will announce a new process for dealing with abuse cases, he said. while the legal investigation goes on, friday's report underlined the human cost of abuse. it showed that the most abuse occurred between the 1950s and the late 1980s, a period when priests, some of them teachers, had greater access to children and enjoyed great respect and trust among parents in belgium, where catholicism is the majority religion. though some of the statements by victims tell of the abuse in detail, names and places have been deleted to preserve the anonymity of the victims and those suspected of abuse. the testimony illustrates the way victims struggled for years to try to come to terms with the abuse, sometimes with results that devastated families. many complain of illness or mental health problems. friends or relatives reported that the suicides of 13 victims \"were related to sexual abuse by clergy,\" the report said. six other victims said they had attempted suicide. and one victim mentioned the suicide of a partner because of the impact of abuse and the way it affected their relationship. some also paint a picture of a church hierarchy determined to ignore any damaging allegations. one 17-year-old said she complained to a bishop about an abusive relationship with a priest and said she was told, \"ignore him and he'll leave you alone.\" in some cases, the abuse started when victims were very young. one victim was 2 years old, five were 4 years old, eight were 5, seven were 6, and 10 were 7. \"males are at a markedly higher risk between 10 and 14 years,\" the report says, while the risk for women is more uniform through their childhood and adolescence and tends to increase with age. dr. adriaenssens described the report as the church's \"dutroux dossier,\" a reference to marc dutroux, belgium's notorious pedophile and child killer, who is serving a life sentence in prison. \"of course, the facts revealed are old,\" said dr. adriaenssens, according to the belgian newspaper le soir. \"society has evolved, parents now are more sensitive to the rights of children, but nothing indicates that the proportion of pedophiles has declined.\"",

        "abstract": "a founder of givewell, a new nonprofit research organization that seeks to assess the effectiveness of charities, has been demoted after admitting that he promoted the organization on a web site by posing as a prospective charitable donor seeking information. givewell's board acted last week against the founder, holden karnofsky, demoting him from executive director to \"program officer\" and saying it was withholding $5,000 of his salary and using the money to pay for him to take a professional development course. the board said it would contact all donors who had contributed to givewell since dec. 1 and offer to return their money. \"the board believes that the acts of misrepresentation that were committed are indefensible and are in direct conflict with the goals of the organization,\" the board said in a statement posted on givewell.net late friday night. givewell drew attention last month when, in articles on dec. 20, its demanding approach to assessing the work charities do was reported in the new york times and the wall street journal. mr. karnofsky and his co-founder, elie hassenfeld, were also interviewed that day on the cnbc program \"power lunch.\" ten days later, mr. karnofsky, writing as geremiah, posted a question to ask metafilter, a question-and-answer page that is part of metafilter, a community blog. \"all the web sites i've seen just have huge lists of charities with some basic financial data/ratings,\" mr. karnofsky, as geremiah, wrote. \"i'd ideally like to hear from someone who has put some time into examining/comparing charities and can recommend someone who's good. any ideas?\" roughly a half-hour later, after three other people had posted comments, mr. karnofsky, writing as himself under the name holden0 but without disclosing his relationship with givewell, answered his own question and recommended givewell's web site. \"this was a horrible lapse in judgment,\" mr. karnofsky wrote in a dec. 31 post on givewell's site. reached by phone on monday, he said he was not authorized to comment. participants in various metafilter discussions continue to call for more severe punishment of mr. karnofsky. \"i think holden should have absolutely been fired,\" one metafilter participant, daniel gadsby, a marketing coordinator in toronto, said in a telephone interview. mr. gadsby said that mr. karnofsky demanded transparency among charities he assessed and that what he had done was therefore hypocritical. \"if i did that at my job,\" he added, \"i'd be fired.\" robert elliott, givewell's chairman, defended the board's response, saying, \"we decided that holden's analysis skills and commitment to helping others continues to be well suited to helping givewell accomplish its goals.\"",

        "title": "ebola may pose little threat to u.s., but it looms large on twitter.",
        "abstract": "as the shadow of the deadly ebola virus looms over africa, its danger clear and present, a lesser kind of contagion, diffuse but persistent, has infected social media feeds in the united states. ebola is trending on twitter. even a cursory hashtag search turns up, among the news articles and official announcements, expressions of fear, gallows humor and bad information. the virus can spread through the air? omg! (it cannot.) a possible ebola case in new york city? time to pack for mars! (it was not ebola.) why do people feel compelled to post and rebroadcast jokes, rumors and dread of a distant disease that public health officials say is extremely unlikely to pose serious risk on this side of the atlantic ocean? the science behind how and why ideas spread on social media is a growing area of research. at the most basic level, marketing experts say, people tend to share stories that stir their deepest feelings, whether positive or negative. to wit, frightful shark attacks routinely top the trending charts alongside cheerful cat videos and inspirational quotes. \"we are not just information-processing machines; we're very driven by emotion,\" said jonah berger, a marketing professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania and author of the book \"contagious: why things catch on.\" stronger emotions, dr. berger has found, increase sharing. in 2011, he investigated the emotions that compel users to share articles via email. dr. berger asked 40 students to jog in place, and then presented each of them with a neutral news article that they could email to whomever they wanted. after the physical arousal of jogging, dr. berger found that students were more likely to share the article, compared with when sitting still. he concluded that people share content when they are stimulated, regardless of the source. \"it's whatever generates arousal,\" he said. \"if you read a scary article about ebola, and then you read another article, you're more likely to share that second article because you're anxious.\" sharing stories on social media may help us relieve some of that anxiety, according to pamela rutledge, a psychologist and director of the media psychology research center in corona del mar, calif.\"twitter panics, such as we're seeing with ebola, are a reflection of people trying to get information, sharing information even if it's inaccurate because being part of the conversation is less threatening than being out of the 'know,' \" dr. rutledge said by email. how many ebola patients have been treated outside of africa? questions and answers on the scale of the outbreak and the science of the ebola virus. our compulsion to post on twitter about ebola may be compounded by the fact that the human mind is hard-wired to focus on subjects with vivid examples. \"when people think about ebola, they imagine flesh-eating, visceral, gory stuff,\" dr. berger said. \"high-arousal emotions increase sharing, and that's even more likely when it's visceral.\" this theory is based on a concept in psychology known as availability bias, which emerged some 40 years ago. in a study published in the journal cognitive psychology in 1973, amos tversky and daniel kahneman found that people tend to judge the likelihood of an event based on immediate examples that come to mind. for instance, you are much more likely to drown in the ocean than to be eaten by a shark. but since you can imagine a shark attack in graphic detail, you worry about it disproportionately. public interest in the ebola outbreak, a rare disease with vivid, disturbing symptoms, may have similar roots. the flu, after all, kills thousands of people in the united states every year, but it is rarely a hot topic on twitter. other researchers, however, believe that the recipe for social-media momentum is less well defined. \"there are a few pretty general features that enhance likelihood that something will go viral,\" said duncan j. watts, a sociologist and principal researcher at microsoft research in new york. \"for example, if it's terrible and violent and people are dying, that's a positive feature in your model,\" he said. \"boring and heavy are unlikely to go viral.\" beyond that, however, dr. watts posits that social-media obsessions are primarily fueled not by public sentiment, but by the influence of the mass media. users focus on subjects that major outlets choose to cover, he said, and when journalists write and talk about ebola, twitter users begin posting comments about it. \"i suspect that for a lot of these viral phenomena,\" he said, \"look under the surface, and working there is the mass media.\" but the overheated twitter rhetoric may have a few positive effects, spurring efforts by news media, advocates and individuals like dr. thomas r. frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, to go into overdrive posting facts and hosting chat sessions to debunk rumors and quell fear. moreover, dr. watts added, when twitter feeds are abuzz with concerns about ebola, that may spur public health officials to do more to beat back the outbreak. \"if panic on social media gets world health authorities to pay attention and devote serious resources to a problem, it's probably a good thing,\" he said.",

        "title": "mets' r.a. dickey appears on 'daily show' as mets discuss his fate.",
        "abstract": "r. a. dickey hails from nashville, but in many ways new york has become his adopted home. it is where he has produced a surprising and triumphant new chapter for what had been a long, winding and often frustrating baseball career. but on tuesday, in a quirky twist evocative of his signature knuckleball pitch, dickey was in manhattan, making an appearance on \"the daily show with jon stewart,\" while his baseball fate was being discussed, and perhaps decided, back in nashville, where the baseball winter meetings are under way. dickey, the national league cy young award winner, has one year remaining on his contract with the mets , and he is seeking an extension. but the mets, intent on addressing the numerous holes in their lineup and without the money to pursue big-name free agents, seem open to the idea of trading dickey now for some talented young players. so as dickey appeared on the show with stewart, who is a longtime mets fan, he sensed that his days with the team might be numbered. so did stewart, who seized on the seeming absurdity of the mets trading away a cy young winner and jokingly wondered: \"this tremendous story, this tremendous success, i guess my question is, how will the new york mets screw this up?\" dickey has embraced new york and has said he wants to remain with the mets, despite the team's flaws. but he is 38 years old, has been around and is well aware that baseball is a business. he also knows that general managers like the mets' sandy alderson are hired to build winning clubs, even if it means trading popular players. \"sandy is paid to make the mets better, and if i can help him do that by being traded, then that's what's going to be done,\" dickey said after the show ended. \"that's their job and i understand it.\" as he talked with stewart, dickey sounded less than enthusiastic about the prospect of playing somewhere else, even though any team he is traded to is likely to be in a better position to compete in 2013 than the mets will be. \"i'm hoping to be here,\" he told stewart. \"i love it here.\" after the show, dickey conceded that he had little insight into where he will play next year. \"i'm not privy to what's being talked about in the suites at the opryland hotel,\" he said, referring to the site of the winter meetings. \"i wish i could say there was a percentage attached to it, like 60-40 i'll stay, or 50-50 i'll go, but i'm just not there.\" whatever the odds, dickey, who does not have a no-trade clause in his contract, said he would rather learn his fate now when he can have more time to prepare, move his family and potentially negotiate a contract extension with a new team than to be dealt away in the middle of the 2013 season, right before the july 31 trading deadline. and what he really does not want, he said, is for the mets to keep him but not sign him to a contract extension that would stretch several years. \"it's tough to reconcile coming back on a lame-duck contract,\" he said of the prospect of playing for the mets in 2013 without any guaranteed future beyond that. \"it's kind of like them saying, 'oh well, we don't really want you around, we tried, but it's not worth it to us.' that's a bad dynamic.\" back in nashville, alderson and dickey's longtime agent, bo mckinnis, met rather surreptitiously monday night in the parking lot outside the meeting hotel. their talk did not appear to produce great progress toward a contract extension. indeed, on tuesday afternoon, alderson maintained to reporters that the mets wanted to hold on to dickey but that he was unsure if the sides could find a compromise that would allow that to happen. \"i think that remains to be seen,\" he said. mckinnis spoke separately to reporters and said the negotiations to date had been cordial but that a gap remains on dollar amounts for a contract extension. dickey, mckinnis added, has adjusted to the idea that he may be traded. he said it would just be another unexpected twist in an unusual career. \"when it first came up, it was a shock, like, 'hey, we've got a good thing going on here, how could this even be brought up?' \" said mckinnis, who spoke to dickey on the phone shortly before he taped the \"daily show.\" \"his words to me on the phone were, 'sandy's got a job to do, and if part of that job is trading me, then i'm fine with it.' \" during the show, stewart even joked that dickey might become the first player to be traded while on the air. and then, a little while later, the show ended. dickey was still a met, but maybe not for much longer.",

        "title": "how health plan turns supply-side ideas upside down.",
        "abstract": "barack obama is, in many ways, the left's answer to ronald reagan . both came to office as charismatic and self-confident leaders, elected in times of economic crisis and determined to move the economy in a new direction. what is less obvious, however, is that the signature domestic issue in president obama 's first year in office health care reform is shaping up to be the antithesis of president reagan's supply-side economics . the starting point for ronald reagan was the idea that people respond to incentives. the incentives that he most worried about were those provided by the tax system. according to his budget director, david a. stockman, mr. reagan would regale the staff with stories of how he, as an actor, used to alter his work schedule in response to the tax code. \"you could only make four pictures, and then you were in the top bracket,\" mr. reagan would say. \"so we all quit working after four pictures and went off to the country.\" the key economic concept here is the marginal tax rate, which measures the percentage of a family's incremental income to which the government lays claim. during mr. reagan's time in office, the top marginal tax rate on earned income fell to 28 percent from 50 percent. the verdict on supply-side economics is mixed. the most striking claim associated with the theory that cuts in marginal rates could generate so much extra work effort that tax revenue would rise is unlikely to apply except in extreme cases. but substantial evidence supports the more modest proposition that high marginal tax rates discourage people from working to their full potential. mr. reagan's behavior as a movie actor is a case in point. president obama has said he wants to raise marginal tax rates on high-income taxpayers. yet under his policies, the largest increases in marginal tax rates may well apply not to the rich but to millions of middle-class families. these increases would not show up explicitly in the tax code but, rather, implicitly as part of health care reform. the bill that recently came out of the senate finance committee illustrates the problem. under the proposed legislation, americans would have the opportunity to buy health insurance through government-run exchanges. depending on a family's income, premiums and cost-sharing expenses, like co-payments and deductibles, would be subsidized to make health care more affordable. a family of four with an income, say, of $54,000 would pay $9,900 for health care. that covers only about half the actual cost. uncle sam would pick up the rest. now suppose that the same family earns an additional $12,000 by, for example, having the primary earner work overtime or sending a secondary worker into the labor force. in that case, the federal subsidy shrinks, so the family's cost of health care rises to $12,700. in other words, $2,800 of the $12,000 of extra income, or 23 percent, would be effectively taxed away by the government's new health care system. that implicit marginal tax rate of 23 percent is a significant disincentive. and it comes on top of the explicit marginal tax rate the family already faces from income and payroll taxes. altogether, many families would face marginal rates at or above the 50 percent level that animated the reagan supply-side revolution. one might hope that such a large climb in marginal rates is a bug in the senate finance bill, one that could be fixed before the legislation became law. but there is no simple fix. higher marginal tax rates are an integral part of the obama health plan. here's why: health reformers start with the problem that some people are expensive to insure, because of pre-existing health conditions. their solution is to require insurers to sell insurance to everyone (a policy called guaranteed issue) at the same price (called community rating). this solution, however, causes another problem. for healthy people, insurance is now a bad bet. a person without significant medical needs has an incentive to wait to buy insurance later if and when he gets sick, a decision that raises the cost of insurance for everyone else. this problem, according to the reformers, calls for another solution: a mandate requiring people to buy health insurance. but this mandate leads to yet another problem. requiring an expensive purchase like health insurance can be onerous for low-income families. so the health reformers offer subsidies. which brings us back to marginal tax rates. if large health insurance subsidies were offered to all americans, regardless of income, the program's cost would be exorbitant, requiring substantial increases in explicit taxes. so, instead, the subsidies are phased out as income rises. as a result, we get implicit marginal rates like those in the senate finance bill. none of this necessarily means that health reform is not worth doing. president obama's push for reform is premised on the belief that access to good health care should be a right of all americans a proposition better judged by political philosophers than economists. but we should not forget the cost of translating that noble aspiration into practical policy. as a matter of economic logic, president obama's goal of universal health insurance cannot help but undermine former president reagan's goal of lower marginal tax rates. future generations of americans may find health insurance more affordable, but they will also find hard work less financially rewarding.",

no evidence of its deterring effects,\" mr. simonovic said. in 2014, saudi arabia executed at least 90 people, according to amnesty international. a separate tally, kept by human rights watch , said that saudi arabia put to death 158 prisoners last year. among the charges against sheikh nimr was \"inciting sectarian strife.\" mr. simonovic said his execution was in breach of an international covenant, which allows for the use of capital punishment only in the most serious crimes. the saudis, however, contend that the sheikh was involved in terrorism. saudi arabia is an elected member of the united nations human rights council. the united nations secretary general, ban ki-moon, stopped short of criticizing the kingdom, expressing only his \"disappointment\" with the executions. he said he had conveyed his opposition to the death penalty in a telephone call with the saudi foreign minister on monday. iran has been even more ardent in using the death penalty, executing at least 289 people in 2014, including for drug offenses, according to the amnesty international report. among the most recent executions in iran was that of a woman convicted of killing her husband, whom she was forced to marry at 16. some countries have returned to using capital punishment after suspending the practice for many years. jordan and pakistan resumed executions late in 2014, mostly in terrorism cases. pakistan has put to death an estimated 300 people since then. image a woman was taken after being sentenced to death in beijing in 2001. china is the top executioner in the world. the total number of death sentences it issues is a state secret, but the united nations estimates that china executed 6,687 people from 1999 to 2003. credit agence france-presse getty images that year, egypt, on more than one occasion, sentenced several hundred citizens to death , many of them supporters of the muslim brotherhood who had participated in violent political protests in which a police officer was killed . the united nations says china carries out the largest number of executions, estimating that 6,687 people were put to death there from 1999 to 2003. while the united states is one of the top five executioners, there has been an effort among state governments to limit the use of the death penalty (the federal government still uses it, though rarely). at least 12 states have a moratorium or an official hold on the use of the death penalty, and in several others, courts are considering challenges to execution by lethal injection, according to the death penalty information center . twenty-eight people were executed in the united states last year, continuing a six-year decline. india, the second-most populous country in the world, still has the death penalty, too, and last used it in july to execute one of the central figures in a deadly series of bombings in mumbai in 1993. the condemned man, yakub memon , was only the fourth person executed in india since 2000, although in 2014, three men convicted of raping a photojournalist in mumbai were sentenced to death under new sex crime laws . in the islamic world, the authorities often argue that capital punishment is justified under shariah law . but the punishment is used on virtually every continent. in south america, for instance, trinidad and tobago retain the death penalty, as do several countries in africa, including guinea and zimbabwe. the saudi executions did not figure in a security council statement that was issued monday evening. the statement condemned the ransacking and burning of the saudi embassy in tehran. the saudi ambassador to the united nations, abdullah bin yahya almoalimi, told reporters monday evening that the 47 prisoners executed on saturday had been charged in a variety of crimes, including sedition and aiding terrorists. he said he expected support from the council in the form of a statement condemning the attacks on the saudi consulate.",

        "abstract": "cleveland, oct. 18 terry francona, the boston red sox manager, has known joe torre since francona was 8 years old. when francona's father, tito, was with the atlanta braves in 1967, he became teammates with torre. terry was just a boy buzzing around the clubhouse, but he immediately developed respect for torre. those feelings have never left. so, as francona sat in the red sox dugout before game 5 of the american league championship series against the cleveland indians on thursday, he said it felt strange to know that someone he had respected and enjoyed competing with was no longer with the yankees . \"i've always had a lot of respect for joe,\" francona said. \"everyone can talk about joe and have their opinions, but he's a gentleman. he's always been a gentleman.\" as a testament to torre's 12-year legacy with the yankees and the way that he has been intertwined with the red sox, three of the first five questions that francona fielded during a pregame news conference were about torre. the red sox were trying to keep their season alive, but they were still asked about what had happened with the former manager of their biggest rivals. \"it will be weird to not see him in the yankee dugout,\" tim wakefield said. francona was preparing for the do-or-die game thursday when red sox general manager theo epstein told him that torre had rejected the yankees' one-year, $5 million offer with bonuses. francona did not discuss torre's decision or the offer, but said, \"i hope joe is happy.\" meanwhile, eric wedge, the indians manager, was more direct. wedge called torre, who won four world series titles, \"one of the greatest managers of all time.\" then wedge complimented the principled way torre handled himself. \"i know there's a business side of it, but, from what i understand, for him to look at that day and say no, good for him,\" wedge said. after the red sox shocked the yankees by rallying from a 3-0 series deficit to snare the 2004 a.l.c.s., torre called wakefield in boston's clubhouse. since wakefield had given up aaron boone's game-winning homer in game 7 of the 2003 a.l.c.s., torre wanted wakefield to know he was happy for him. wakefield said torre's call was classy. \"i have so much respect for him as a manager that i hoped to be able to play for him at some point in my career,\" wakefield said. \"i've talked to guys who have played for him, guys like johnny damon. they say he's the best.\" bob watson, who was the yankees' general manager when torre won his first title in 1996, said he was not surprised that torre left. \"it's time,\" said watson, who was apparently referring to everything torre had endured in 12 years with george steinbrenner, the principal owner. but jim leyritz, one of torre's former players, who has admitted that he did not have a strong relationship with torre, said he was surprised that torre turned down a chance to return for 2008. leyritz wondered if torre wanted a two-year contract because that would have presumably enabled him to manage the team when it opened its new stadium in 2009. \"i actually thought the one-year rocking-chair tour would be a good way to send him out and a good way for joe to walk into the sunset,\" leyritz said. \"where it started with him being fired, it went to him having a chance to make $8 million if he won the world series.\" leyritz played general manager, too, and said don mattingly was the \"only logical choice\" to follow torre. \"donnie is the only guy with the star power,\" leyritz said. francona said he had conversations with torre during all six series this season, even if they did not necessarily chat in front of the news media. when francona was asked if he would contact torre, he said boston needed to win game 5 \"or i might be getting the phone calls. joe might be calling me.\" about an hour later, francona said he would call torre in a few days. but, a few minutes after that, francona asked a new york reporter for some help. \"if you talk to him, could you give him a message?\" francona said. \"let him know i was asking for him.\"",

        "abstract": "a week before viacom announced that it would make video content available online through a site called joost, the viacom-owned mtv networks said that it would soon allow other web sites to embed video clips from its own sites: mtv.com, vh1.com, comedycentral.com , bet.com and others. \"we need to open up our web sites and content both for consumers and for other companies,\" mika salmi, mtv networks' president of global digital media, told reuters, which said the move was \"part of a strategy to bring viacom's web sites up to 'web 2.0' standards.\" if so, it is a new strategy. for most of its history, the mtv sites have been anything but open. until recently, clips from comedy central were available only to those using the internet explorer browser, and macintosh users who wanted to watch a video on vh1's vspot broadband service were out of luck. and even now, trying to find a clip from, say, \"the daily show\" often requires an infuriating amount of searching and drilling down through several clicks. and forget about sending your friend a link directly to the video it cannot be done. still, the sites have improved. and gigaom's om malik praised the mtv networks decision to let users embed videos, writing this week that it served as evidence that the people at viacom \"seem to be correcting themselves on many fronts\" ( gigaom.com ). and it could make up for much of the promotional boost viacom lost when it pulled its content from youtube, the video-sharing site owned by google. the joost deal may improve things, depending largely on how user-friendly the site is. unlike youtube, joost will feature clips and entire episodes, complete with commercials. and it does not allow users to upload videos. it is just tv on the internet, so there are no depictions of teenagers re-enacting their favorite 50 cent videos. viacom's decision to drop youtube and hook up with joost has drawn vitriol from the \"big media must be toppled\" crowd. viacom will be sorry, wrote stan schroeder on his blog at frantic industries, because \"big media companies are not giving the people what they want.\" \"they're giving them what they, the companies, think they should have.\" of course, viacom's problem with youtube arose because so many people want precisely what big media gives them: \"the daily show,\" \"south park,\" music videos, \"american gangster.\" as ever, the sticking point was money. some are saying that viacom may yet come to terms with youtube, and the joost deal may be, at least in part, a negotiating tactic. it will, writes \"mike\" on techdirt, allow viacom to \"go back to the folks at google/youtube and say \"look, joost is willing to pay us money!\" in the hopes that it will convince youtube to pay out as well.\" hot-dog defiance it seems only fitting: the first chicago institution to be cited for circumventing the city's new ban on foie gras is a northwest side hot-dog joint. but hot doug's isn't quite the standard under-the-el-tracks chicago doggery ( hotdougs.com ). the dish that got the owner, doug sohn, busted was a \"foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle sauce moutarde and armagnac-truffle chicken mousse,\" according to the chicago sun-times. the price was $6.50. the health department hit mr. sohn with a $250 fine. \"people are actually dying from the cold, and i'm getting hassled because of some sausage,\" he told the sun-times on a day when the temperature hovered around zero. mr. sohn, who calls hot doug's an \"encased-meat emporium,\" is an outspoken opponent of the ordinance. those pesky allergies jessica simpson, a spokeswoman for pizza hut, has said that she is allergic to cheese, tomatoes and wheat, according to an article in elle magazine. \"you know,\" writes meghann marco of the consumerist, \"it's not that we require that every celebrity constantly use the product they're shilling for, but we'd like to think that the spokesperson is able to eat the food without getting sick\". dan mitchell",

        "title": "vatican's celestial eye, seeking not angels but data.",
        "abstract": "mount graham, ariz. faure's \"requiem\" is playing in the background, followed by the kronos quartet. every so often the music is interrupted by an electromechanical arpeggio like a jazz riff on a clarinet as the motors guiding the telescope spin up and down. a night of galaxy gazing is about to begin at the vatican 's observatory on mount graham. \"got it. o.k., it's happy,\" says christopher j. corbally, the jesuit priest who is vice director of the vatican observatory research group, as he sits in the control room making adjustments. the idea is not to watch for omens or angels but to do workmanlike astronomy that fights the perception that science and catholicism necessarily conflict. last year, in an opening address at a conference in rome, called \"science 400 years after galileo galilei,\" cardinal tarcisio bertone, the secretary of state of the vatican, praised the church's old antagonist as \"a man of faith who saw nature as a book written by god.\" in may, as part of the international year of astronomy, a jesuit cultural center in florence conducted \"a historical, philosophical and theological re-examination\" of the galileo affair. but in the effort to rehabilitate the church's image, nothing speaks louder than a paper by a vatican astronomer in, say, the astrophysical journal or the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society. on a clear spring night in arizona, the focus is not on theology but on the long list of mundane tasks that bring a telescope to life. as it tracks the sky, the massive instrument glides on a ring of pressurized oil. pumps must be activated, gauges checked, computers rebooted. the telescope's electronic sensor, similar to the one in a digital camera, must be cooled with liquid nitrogen to keep the megapixels from fuzzing with quantum noise. as dr. corbally rushes from station to station flicking switches and turning dials, he seems less like a priest or even an astronomer than a maintenance engineer. finally when everything is ready, starlight scooped up by the six-foot mirror is chopped into electronic bits, which are reconstituted as light on his video screen. \"much of observing these days is watching monitors and playing with computers,\" dr. corbally says. \"people say, 'oh, that must be so beautiful being out there looking at the sky.' i tell them it's great if you like watching tv.\" dressed in blue jeans and a work shirt, he is not a man who wears his religion on his sleeve. no grace is offered before a quick casserole dinner in the observatory kitchen. in fact, the only sign that the vatican advanced technology telescope is fundamentally different from the others on mount graham, the home of an international astronomical complex operated by the university of arizona, is a dedication plaque outside the door. \"this new tower for studying the stars has been erected on this peaceful site,\" it says in latin. \"may whoever searches here night and day the far reaches of space use it joyfully with the help of god.\" at that point, religion leaves off and science begins. the roman catholic church's interest in the stars began with purely practical concerns when in the 16th century pope gregory xiii called on astronomy to correct for the fact that the julian calendar had fallen out of sync with the sky. in 1789, the vatican opened an observatory in the tower of the winds, which it later relocated to a hill behind st. peter's dome. in the 1930s, church astronomers moved to castel gandolfo, the pope's summer residence. as rome's illumination, the electrical kind, spread to the countryside, the church began looking for a mountaintop in a dark corner of arizona. building on mount graham was a struggle. apaches said the observatory was an affront to the mountain spirits. environmentalists said it was a menace to a subspecies of red squirrel. there were protests and threats of sabotage. it wasn't until 1995, three years after the edict of inquisition was lifted against galileo, that the vatican's new telescope made its first scientific observations. the target tonight is three spiral galaxies nos. 3165, 3166, 3169 in the new general catalog lying about 60 million light-years from earth , a little south of the constellation leo. sitting at a desk near dr. corbally is aileen o'donoghue, an astronomer from st. lawrence university in canton, n.y., who is interested in how these gravitational masses tug at one another, creating the stellar equivalent of tides. \"exposing, 30 minutes,\" she says. as celtic ballads play in the control room, data is sucked up by hard drives, and a column of numbers scrolls down her computer screen. dr. o'donoghue, who was raised roman catholic, is the author of \"the sky is not a ceiling: an astronomer's faith,\" in which she describes how she lost and then rediscovered god \"in the vastness, the weirdness, the abundance, the seeming nonsensicalness, and even the violence of this incredible universe.\" in person she's not nearly so intense. while waiting for an image to gel, she steps out on a balcony for a look at the unprocessed sky. the beehive cluster, one of the first things galileo saw with his telescope, is sparkling in the constellation cancer . next to it is leo, where dr. o'donoghue is looking for the gravitational tides. \"it's the real sky that matters,\" she says. she describes how she makes her undergraduate students go outside and look at the big dipper at different times of the night. \"they come back and say, 'it moves!' \" words galileo legendarily muttered after he was forced to recant. \"you can tell students that the earth rotates, but until they see that with their eyeballs, they're not doing science,\" she said. \"you might as well be teaching theology and scripture.\" back inside the control room she explains how the gravitational tides she is studying might be stellar nurseries. as one galaxy brushes by another, clouds of gas are stirred so violently that they give birth to stars. in the vatican observatory's annual report, at the point where a corporation might describe its business strategy, is a section delineating the difference between creatio ex nihilo (creation from nothing) and creatio continua: \"the fact that at every instant, the continued existence of the universe itself is deliberately willed by god, who in this way is continually causing the universe to remain created.\" theologians call these \"primary causes,\" those that flow from the unmoved mover. sitting atop this eternal platform is another layer, the \"secondary causes,\" which can be safely left to science. dr. corbally and dr. o'donoghue continue working through the night, collecting data on secondary causes galactic tides, stellar birth. sleep will wait until morning, and thoughts about primary causes for another time.",

reconciliation with the taliban for the apparent purpose of reaching a sort of separate peace. \"very frankly, my view is that with regards to reconciliation,\" leon e. panetta, director of the

only when both sides feel that victory can no longer be achieved. \"reconciliation grows out of stalemate,\" said andrew nathan, a professor of political science at columbia university in new york. \"it's not undertaken to help the other guy get out of a corner, but when one's own options have run out at the same time as the other guy's have.\" \"it's been said that in politics there are no permanent friends,\" mr. nathan continued, \"and by the same token there are no permanent enemies.\" the most conspicuous past attempt at effecting a peace between warring parties came in china just before and just after world war ii, when a succession of u.s. mediators tried, entirely unsuccessfully, to bring the ruling nationalists of chiang kai-shek into a coalition government with the communists under mao zedong. to be sure, the situation was very different from that of afghanistan today, since all three parties at the time, the nationalists, the communists and the americans, had a common adversary in japan, and, indeed, the main initial goal of u.s. policy was to get the chinese parties to cooperate so they could carry more of the burden of the anti-japanese fight. moreover, the nationalists and the communists were formally joined in what was called a united front, so theoretically at least they had some basis on which to build a coalition government that would last after the war. still, the mediation was a fiasco, especially that part of it conducted by the first of the u.s. mediators, an oklahoman named patrick j. hurley, who arrived in the communists' wartime headquarters in remote yenan in november 1944 sure that peace between the two chinese parties was at hand. \"don't worry,\" he told one member of his staff, \"i'll bring these sides together. that's what i'm here for\" this comment courtesy of hannah pakula in her book \"the last empress,\" a biography of chiang kai-shek's wife. hurley presented a coalition plan to mao that he said was authorized by chiang and whose terms were actually favorable to the communists. the problem was that chiang did not support the plan at all, whereupon hurley gave unconditional support to the nationalists even as he tried to persuade the communists to go along. in the end, there was no reconciliation, and the nationalists were kicked from power even as u.s. support for chiang destroyed any hope that a working relationship could be built with mao. a witness to the failure was hurley's interpreter, david d. barrett, who was also the head of a u.s. observer group stationed at yenan. his memoirs include a description of hurley trying to persuade mao to accept the minimal offer that chiang was making, which, hurley was arguing, gave the communists a foot in the door. \"mao countered by saying that a foot in the door meant nothing if one's hands were tied behind one's back,\" barrett recalled. despite efforts to get some taliban to defect in current-day afghanistan, no u.s. mediator striving to bring about reconciliation between the taliban and mr. karzai, since the goal is to destroy the taliban, not to incorporate it into the government. and yet, there are some striking similarities. as in china more than 60 years ago, the united states finds itself tied to a corrupt regime unpopular with many of its own people and facing a very determined and even enterprising foe. but the main similarity may lie in what would seem to be mr. panetta's accurate appraisal of the taliban and in the absence of any sign that it would want reconciliation and power-sharing just as things seem to be going well militarily for it. the chinese precedent may be instructive here too. mao, feeling that his power was growing and that the future belonged to him, cooperated in u.s.-sponsored reconciliation efforts not because he wanted them to succeed but because they helped him in his ultimate goal of total victory by deterring the americans from coming into the war even more forcefully on chiang's side. chiang himself, it should be noted, understood mao's strategy perfectly well, which was why he had to be dragged unwillingly into the entire mediation attempt. he knew that in china ultimately it would be a fight to the finish, no matter how much washington yearned for both sides to make nice. it's possible of course that mr. karzai's stated interest in an afghan reconciliation is also just a tactic, in this instance part of an effort to put pressure on the united states and its coalition partners to step up their effort. here, too, there's an echo of the china case. as ms. pakula wrote in her biography of madame chiang, a senior nationalist official, pressing for u.s. loans on favorable terms, hinted that the japanese had recently made \"some very good offers.\" in other words, pay up or we'll switch sides. but in reality there was no possibility for the nationalists to switch sides and survive; one wonders if there is for mr. karzai.",

        "abstract": "boston when the defending women's overall champion is on the slopes during world cup races, fans can expect to see the flash of a cheetah whiz by, too. for anna fenninger, the cheetah is her totem animal, one she has patterned on her helmet. it is an apt fit for fenninger, a 25-year-old austrian, who also won the olympic gold medal in super-g last year. with an affinity for the world's fastest mammal, fenninger became an ambassador for the cheetah conservation fund in 2013. \"in one moment, they are so peaceful,\" she said in november in beaver creek, colo. \"in the next, they are a killer.\" fenninger, quiet and solitary off the slopes, is a pure predator when it comes to skiing graceful, agile, aggressive, and one of the fastest women in ski racing. last february, fenninger won gold in super-g and silver in giant slalom at the olympics in sochi, russia. a little over a month later, she captured the world cup giant slalom and overall titles, firmly establishing herself as one of the sport's most dominant women. fenninger's best season to date came at a time when lindsey vonn, the american who on monday became the winningest female world cup ski racer with her 63rd victory , was sidelined with a knee injury. fenninger is eager to prove that her 2014 success was not facilitated by vonn's absence. \"it's good for the whole ski circuit that lindsey is back,\" fenninger said. \"but i think there are about four to five girls, including me, who can beat her. nobody is unbeatable.\" instead of linking her success to vonn's absence, fenninger credits her failed 2010 olympic bid. going into the vancouver games, fenninger, then 20, was a rising star on the austrian team. she had placed fourth in super-g at the 2009 world championships in val d'isere, france, and was eager to prove herself on the global stage. but in whistler, british columbia, where the olympic alpine skiing events were held, she had trouble with the snow conditions, the news media frenzy and the pressure to perform. she walked away from the 2010 games with 16th-place finishes in super-g and super combined, a 25th-place finish in downhill and a steely determination to redeem herself after her defeat. \"i was really disappointed,\" fenninger said. \"it was a bad experience for me. then you have to wait four years.\" between the 2010 and 2014 winter games, fenninger focused on one thing: olympic glory. she hired a new service man, revamped her fitness routine, tested hundreds of skis and learned everything she could about her equipment. \"it was like a new start,\" she said. \"it worked from the first day.\" in february 2011, fenninger won gold in super-g at the alpine world championships in garmisch, germany, which helped her rediscover her faith in herself and her skiing. \"i was world champion, but i hadn't skied at my limit,\" she said. \"i knew there could be so much more. that was a really big step. then every year, i got better and better, and i got my confidence back.\" she moved up in the overall standings, from 12th in 2011 to fifth in 2012 to third in 2013 and finally to no. 1 in 2014, a year in which she collected two world cup titles, two olympic medals and redemption. \"i had to learn a lot in those years between vancouver and sochi, and they were very important for my win in sochi,\" she said. going into this weekend's races in st. moritz, switzerland, fenninger has five podium finishes this season, including one win, and is second in the overall standings, 331 points behind tina maze of slovenia. fenninger leads the super-g rankings after finishing second to vonn on monday in cortina d'ampezzo, italy. although she is skiing well, fenninger has struggled with delivering consistent results across all disciplines. \"what is missing at the moment is the total consistency to be at the very top in every race,\" said meinhard tatschl, a coach for the austrian women's team. although fenninger will not say so, there is something else in her way: vonn. with five top-three finishes in the season's eight speed events, vonn has demonstrated that she is back in prime form after missing nearly two seasons because of an injured right knee. \"i concentrate on my performance, and i always give my best,\" fenninger said. \"i'm not thinking about the performance of others.\" however, she said she looked forward to the matchup with vonn at the alpine world championships in beaver creek beginning feb. 2. \"i think the world champs could be very good for me,\" fenninger said. \"it's a very technical course, and i like the american snow. we'll see what the world championships bring. everything is possible.\"",

        "title": "moves to strengthen disabled access law.",
        "abstract": "peekskill on a saturday afternoon here in her hometown, lisa tarricone wants a cup of coffee from her local coffee shop. for ms. tarricone, a director at westchester independent living center who uses a wheelchair, that everyday wish brings a series of maneuvers. first is a call to the shop to ask that a rudimentary wooden ramp be positioned atop a deep step; then a request to an employee to prop open the door so ms. tarricone can use both arms to wheel herself up the nonregulation ramp (no handles; improper pitch); finally, the navigation of a crowd of customers that is complicated on this day by a performer stationed near the door. it is time-consuming and cumbersome \"and all of it in front of an audience of people who are staring while you're trying to get inside, maybe annoyed that you're letting the air-conditioning out just for the sake of a latte,\" she said several days later. life in a wheelchair is a series of carefully calculated moves, ms. tarricone said, and some of the obstacles are not merely inconvenient they are also a violation of the federal americans with disabilities act, enacted 18 years ago last month. advocates for people with disabilities hope such incidents of noncompliance will diminish with recent changes to state law that allow for a new level of enforcement of existing a.d.a. law, said michael hellmann, a westchester lawyer specializing in disability law. \"westchester businesses are filled with a.d.a. violations,\" he said. \"now that it's part of new york law, they run a much greater risk of having legal action taken against them.\" federal law prohibits discrimination against anyone with a disability, which it defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. there are 50 million americans with a disability, according to the united states department of justice based on the 2000 census. about 147,000 live in westchester, based on figures compiled at the same time by the county. until now, legal recourse for anyone encountering a violation of the americans with disabilities act was limited to filing a complaint with the federal justice department, which had a backlog of cases, or pursuing a federal lawsuit, mr. hellmann said. in january, the new york state division of human rights incorporated a section of the federal a.d.a. covering businesses or places of public accommodation. that allows state enforcement of the part of the a.d.a. requiring \"places of public accommodation to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices and procedures when providing access for a person with a disability,\" said john p. herrion, director of disability rights for the state division of human rights. the law not only provides an additional resource for bringing a complaint, but also provides a broader definition of a disability, protecting individuals who were previously excluded from the federal definition, he said. mr. herrion stressed that the division is sensitive to the costs to businesses and pointed to considerations within the americans with disabilities act that are intended to prevent \"undue burden\" or \"fundamentally alter the nature of the public accommodation,\" he said. but determining that discretion can be difficult, particularly as misinformation and confusion over a.d.a. compliance are commonplace even among lawmakers and business advocates. james lorr, a co-owner of the peekskill coffee house where ms. tarricone occasionally ventures for coffee, said his operation complied with the a.d.a, pointing to remodeling the bathroom as one change. he also pointed to the wooden ramp that sits inside the cafe for use whenever wheelchair accessibility is needed, calling it a reasonable accommodation given the building's historic status. but mr. hellmann dismissed the use of a temporary ramp by any business, pointing to requirements in the a.d.a. about the pitch and stability of access ramps. he said that businesses often fail to go far enough in adhering to a.d.a., part of what he described as the myths of complying with the law. the biggest myth, by far, he said regards the so-called grandfather clause. \"unlike building codes, the a.d.a. does not have a grandfather clause,\" mr. hellmann said. \"no matter how old a building, it is not totally excused from complying with the a.d.a.\" some of the education for businesses is being provided on the county level. westchester's office for the disabled regularly dispatches staff members to investigate businesses that may not be complying with the a.d.a. the purpose, said evan latainer, the director of the office, is to help businesses understand what they must do to avoid a next step of possible litigation. on a recent weekday morning, anna m. masopust and andrea sadowski of the county's office for the disabled spoke with staff members at a local gym about the use of an elevator designated for people with a disability. frank sessa, 84, a yonkers retiree who frequents the club, paused from exercising in the pool to describe his aggravation when gym employees continuously misplaced the elevator key. he said he relies on the key for access to the pool and locker room, adding, \"the custodian finally duplicated the key for me.\" having his own key has brought only partial satisfaction, he said, because the elevator is regularly used to transport freight. \"it's illegal to use this lift for anything other than a person with a disability,\" ms. masopust said, pointing to a plaque on the adjoining wall that states what she was saying. besides changes in state law, changes by the county have added resources for disability claims. last month, the county human rights commission used county government support to achieve countywide jurisdiction over its human rights law, said delores scott brathwaite, director of the division. previously, the commission jurisdiction was excluded from municipalities like white plains, yonkers, mount vernon, mamaroneck, larchmont, new rochelle and peekskill. advocates for the disabled say the recent changes in state and county law are important in educating the public on what is guaranteed under the federal law. ms. tarricone and others stressed how changes in law address not only the logistical rights of access, but also help transform society's views about a segment of the population they say has been historically overlooked. \"there are millions of physically or mentally disabled people who deserve something better,\" said howard w. rasher, a retired lawyer and disability advocate from briarcliff manor. \"now, we can put meaningful teeth into the existing laws.\"",

        "abstract": "to get to her night-shift factory job, laura pinto, 67, leaves her bronx apartment and shuffles five blocks to the grand concourse, where she boards a no. 1 bus. she takes it to 205th street, gingerly disembarks, walks two crosstown blocks and gets on another, the no. 20, which takes her to yonkers. for the two-and-a-half-hour trip, ms. pinto chooses from one of seven canes and walkers of varying height and durability, making her selection according to what is hurting most. after eight hours of cleaning bathrooms and mopping floors, and handling machines that make plastic makeup compacts, ms. pinto begins the trip back, now sharing the sidewalks and buses with commuters keeping daytime hours. once home, she heats chicken soup, a foundation for the fistful of pills she takes before going to bed: vytorin for high cholesterol, allopurinol and colchicine for gout. there's cozaar, amlodipine and felodipine to lower her blood pressure, and gabapentin for diabetes. the metoprolol is for hypertension, the ultram for chronic pain. loratadine helps with allergies, nexium with heartburn, clonidine with nerve pain. she swallows in stages. ms. pinto does not talk of physical privations or fatigue. she does express concern about thieves who take advantage of her circumstances: an older immigrant with health problems who speaks no english, negotiating a nighttime commute alone, a long way from her native ecuador. \"if something really bad happened to me, no one would know,\" she says. one man stopped her on the street and, realizing she did not understand him, took the initiative. rummaging through her bag, he settled on a coin purse containing $3 and two photographs of her grandchildren. another man took her metrocard. with rent consuming about $600 of ms. pinto's $880 monthly take-home pay, and no savings to speak of, there is little room for muggings. in january when a third man pulled from her purse a blank $598.50 money order intended for rent, it was a financial blow from which she could not recover. \"i try my hardest not to owe anyone, but i can't pay rent twice in one month,\" ms. pinto says. \"i barely earn enough to live.\" her landlord did not evict her, but the theft put ms. pinto in the red for months. even after suspending monthly wires of $20 to her daughter in ecuador, there was little chance of climbing her way out. with $598.50 from the federation of protestant welfare agencies and $27.14 from the catholic charities of the archdiocese of new york, two of seven charitable organizations supported by the new york times neediest cases fund , ms. pinto paid off her rental arrears and an outstanding phone bill. she is now out of debt and, with an additional $300 monthly subsidy from the protestant agency's stipend program, she can more reasonably hope to meet her expenses, buy groceries, send $20 a month home to ecuador and, perhaps, set something aside. she also hopes to buy back a gold chain she pawned for $180 a while back. it had belonged to her brother miguel, the only one of her five siblings who came to the united states with her two decades ago. he died of cancer last summer. \"this will be my first christmas without him,\" she says. now her closest relatives are the 52 framed photographs on her wall: her daughter in ecuador; her son in spain; her son in ecuador; her many grandchildren, most of whom she has never met; her godson; her nieces; her nephews; her dead sister; her living sister; miguel when they first arrived in new york, in 1984; miguel last new year's eve; her brother in spain; and a group shot of her daughter with two of her grandchildren. \"i would go back to ecuador,\" she says, \"but there's nothing there. at least here there is work. if i can save, i will bring them here.\" also on the wall are holiday decorations she got from a charity in her neighborhood. santa claus dolls are pinned to one side, a felt tree with trimmings to the other. strings of little white lights border the room. none of it was put up recently, though. she hung the decorations a few years ago and decided to leave them up year round. she motions to a tinsel garland from which hangs a row of glass ornaments. \"it's christmas every day,\" she says.",

        "abstract": "small-business owners took aim on thursday at the new york city council's package of antismoking legislation, including a proposal to raise the minimum age to purchase cigarettes to 21 . representatives of bodegas and convenience stores complained at a council hearing in lower manhattan that the proposals would make cigarettes so hard to get from legitimate businesses that they would drive customers into the arms of bootleg distributors, including organized crime. \"this is bad for new york,\" chong sik lee, president of the korean-american grocers association of new york, said at the hearing. referring to the many immigrant retailers in his organization, he added, \"how may they build up business they can pass on to their children?\" the council is considering legislation that would make it illegal for stores to sell cigarettes to anyone under 21, up from 18. but smoking or possessing cigarettes under that age would not be illegal. it is also considering barring retailers from openly displaying cigarettes and other tobacco products; raising penalties when retailers are found in possession of illegal cigarettes; setting a minimum price of $10.50 per pack of cigarettes or little cigars and barring discounts of tobacco products. thursday's hearing was the first chance for opponents of the proposed laws to be heard since christine c. quinn, the city council speaker and a democratic mayoral candidate, announced the proposed age minimum. ms. quinn, however, left before opponents had a chance to speak. robert s. bookman, a lawyer for the n.y.c. newsstand operators association, a 25-year-old trade group, said that hiding cigarettes behind a curtain or a wall in stores would just backfire, because retailers would plaster the walls with advertising. \"you think they're going to be empty, blank?\" mr. bookman said of the cabinets and other places where cigarettes would be concealed. \"so we should do that next,\" retorted councilwoman maria del carmen arroyo, a bronx democrat who leads the council's health committee. \"fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your position, we do have something called the first amendment in this country,\" mr. bookman said. dr. thomas a. farley, the city's health commissioner, told the council hearing that several years after the town of needham, mass., increased the age for buying cigarettes to 21, the number of high school students who reported smoking in the past month had declined to 5.5 percent from 12.9 percent. ramon murphy, president of the bodega association of the united states, complained that cigarette taxes were already so high in new york that people would rather pay $6 a pack on the black market than $12 retail. dr. farley acknowledged that high cigarette taxes had made the city an attractive destination for bootleggers, costing the city an estimated $250 million to $600 million a year in unpaid taxes. he said the answer to the problem was to crack down on trafficking and tax evasion.",

        "abstract": "bangalore, india naitik gohain, 17, has a secret. as he prepares to enter engineering school, he is living in a hostel in hyderabad. like many young indians who have left home for the first time, mr. gohain has been expanding his social horizons beyond the radar of his family in guwahati, 1,500 miles to the northeast. while they do not even know he has a girlfriend, his friends in hyderabad know all about her, from the breezy status updates he posts using an instant messaging application in his phone, often in the form of confessions about what he was doing the evening before. users like mr. gohain are flocking to use the app, called hike, for just that reason: it can keep a secret. in june the free service, which is less than two years old, surpassed 20 million users, making it by far the most popular indian-made instant messaging system. hike's selling point is that it lets users filter the information they transmit in sophisticated ways and, more to the point, cloak aspects of their social lives from their parents. mr. gohain hides the \"last seen\" timer that reveals to contacts when he has last logged in, so his parents believe him when he says he is busy studying. he keeps delicate one-to-one chats in \"hidden\" mode, and stores selected contacts in a concealed, password-accessible mode, so that someone picking up his phone will see only a list of innocuous contacts. \"one of the reasons hike is trending is that young people crave control, and this app lets you have control,\" mr. gohain said. like wechat in china, line in japan and kakaotalk in south korea, in its home country hike has started to outdo bigger global rivals like whatsapp . it is tailored to attract the rapidly growing under-25 age group, in a society where the young are shedding conservatism. indians commonly live with their parents well into their 30s, and it is not unusual for middle-class families in smaller towns to share a single smartphone because of the cost, making privacy still more complicated. hike's developers knew those challenges because they had also faced them. \"we focused on built-for-india features when we realized that free messaging apps are becoming red hot, but hardly any were tailored to the needs of the market,\" said kavin bharti mittal, hike's chief of product and strategy. in a first for messaging apps, hike allows its users to send free text messages to people who use \"feature phones\" low-end devices that lack a smartphone's ability to download apps and to people who usually keep their phones' internet connection turned off to save money. it allows chats within groups of up to 100 people, and transfer of large files, a useful ability for students exchanging homework files. india is the third-largest smartphone market by sales, after china and the united states, and since the end of last year it has been the fastest growing. mr. mittal calls it the \"last frontier\" for smartphone makers, as large numbers of feature phone users make the transition to more capable devices. the proliferation of smartphones has fueled the explosive growth in messaging-app use. people are \"going mad\" over the free apps, said b. kumaresh, who works at the mobile store, a retail chain outlet in mysore. mr. mittal whose father founded bharti enterprises , the parent of india's largest cellphone service provider said his team was working on many more privacy and secrecy features. kriti gupta, 21, a graduate student in rohtak, in the northern state of haryana, recently used hike to conspire with classmates and throw a surprise party for a friend. she said messaging apps had become \"part and parcel of life\" for her generation. mr. kumaresh, the salesman in mysore, said that even though he had been selling phones for eight years, children only 10 or 11 often knew much more about messaging apps than he did. \"parents give phones to teenagers to keep tabs on them, but by using the secrecy features, the kids are neatly turning the tables on the older generation.\"",

        "title": "who pays for efficiency?.",
        "abstract": "saving money can be expensive. indeed, the quest to save dollars in the nation's $2.1 trillion annual health care bill is becoming a lucrative market of its own. thousands of companies, large and small, are pitching cost-saving ideas that range from electronic patient records to new medical devices. it's not all marketing hype. experts in health policy agree that there is a real opportunity to curb health spending, which last year was the equivalent of $7,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. studies predict a gain of as much as 30 percent in efficiency, mostly through reducing unnecessary tests and prescriptions, paperwork and medical mistakes. such streamlining would not cut the nation's total medical spending, as long as there is a growing aging population with ever-increasing health needs. but certain measures are expected to help keep costs from spiraling. every cost-saving product or service requires an upfront investment, which bets that it will produce overall savings. and so the paradox kicks in. \"there is money to be saved, but it is not going to be cheap,\" said david m. cutler, a health economist at harvard university. the path to saving can be particularly uncertain in the united states' fragmented health care economy a mix of risk, regulation and profit in which the incentives are often contradictory. a physician, for example, may try new approaches to trim the costs of providing care, but the results usually benefit insurers more than doctors. strides in efficiency may be good for society, though there may be scant financial motivation for the doctors themselves. the experience of dr. richard baron, who practices with three other physicians in an office in philadelphia, provides a glimpse into the predicament. in 2004, dr. baron and his colleagues made the transition from ink and paper to computers and electronic health records. they were doing what health care reformers had been advocating for years. but the arithmetic of investing in health-information technology is daunting, especially for small practices like dr. baron's. his office spent $140,000 on personal computers, including tablet pcs, servers, software and installation. the office's annual technology costs, he said, were about $50,000, including maintenance and technical support, and he plans to upgrade the three-year-old computers at a cost of $54,000. those costs do not include the lost productivity in the first year, when the staff was learning to use the new technology. dr. baron's office has saved money in transcribing medical reports, for example and his practice now handles its 6,000 patients with three fewer office employees. he described other benefits, mainly the ability to find information quickly for patients, hospitals, insurers and labs with a few keystrokes. the technology, dr. baron said, has also helped make him become a more adept physician. but it has not yet paid off in dollars and cents: the savings in salaries is less than the costs entailed in computerization. \"it is a high-risk venture,\" he said, \"and you do it at your own financial peril.\" today, an estimated one-fourth of primary-care doctors use electronic health records, but only 5 percent of them are in offices with five doctors or fewer where about half of all doctors practice. dr. anne wilson has her own internal-medicine practice in rockville, md., and has felt the pinch of reimbursement cutbacks from medicare and other insurers. buying computers and software for electronic health records, dr. wilson said, would mean a big cost with no clear payoff. \"i can't capture the economics of scale as a sole practitioner,\" she said. \"electronic health records may well be a good thing, as a collective good, but why should i make the investment if i don't get any of the gains?\" physicians get only about 11 percent of the savings from electronic health records; the real benefit goes mainly to private and public insurers because, for one, they are paying for fewer unnecessary tests, and automated record-handling is a big cost saving for the payers, according to a study by the center for technology leadership, a medical research group. \"the doctors bear all the costs, and others reap most of the benefit,\" said dr. david j. brailer, who was the national health information technology coordinator in the bush administration from 2004 to 2006. \"the incentives are totally awry.\" in recent years, another well-promoted effort to try to cut costs while improving care has been the use of specialty cardiac hospitals. specialty hospitals, in theory, should be able to achieve quality and efficiency by focusing on a single part of the body. yet a study published in the journal of the american medical association in march found that in regions where cardiac hospitals had opened, the overall rates of angioplasty and open-heart surgery more than doubled after four years, compared with regions without specialty hospitals. this is another example of the paradox, with the lure of saving money undermined by marketplace realities. in the nation's fee-for-service system of medical payments, the more procedures that are done, the more money a specialist or a hospital receives. new technology also tends to increase the number of procedures. cardiac treatment has been revolutionized by angioplasty and stents , meshlike tubes often put in heart arteries to keep them open after blockages have been cleared. stenting, which became common in the late 1990s, costs less, is not as invasive as open-heart surgery and involves shorter recovery times. so the number of open-heart, coronary-bypass surgeries each year has dropped by more than 100,000 since the mid-1990s, but more than a million stent procedures are now performed each year. \"the trigger for intervention is lower and the pool of treatable patients is larger,\" said dr. john d. birkmeyer, director of surgical outcomes research at the university of michigan and a co-author of the journal article. \"these are institutions with an incentive to increase the supply of surgically treatable disease. it's a matter of if you build it, they will come.\" questions in the last year about the long-term safety and effectiveness of stents are causing some patients to think twice about them. nevertheless, the stent-first approach to heart disease in the last decade has meant that the patients who later require bypass surgery are often older and less healthy than the typical open-heart patient years ago. one consequence is that the rate of postsurgery kidney failure has increased sharply, a costly and life-threatening complication. once again, entrepreneurs are ready. the answer to the kidney problem, say engineers at design medical, a start-up company in pelham, n.h., is a new pump for the heart-lung machines used during surgery. with the better blood flow resulting from the new pump, aging kidneys and other organs will come through open-heart surgery in better shape, potentially saving up to $2 billion in hospitalization and treatment costs, said doug vincent, president of design medical. the catch is that the new pump will cost $2,000, about 10 times more than conventional pumps. \"yes, it would be more expensive,\" mr. vincent said. \"but if we're right it would save a lot of money.\" the best way to improve health care and contain costs is to take a new approach, said dr. dean ornish, a clinical professor of medicine at the university of california, san francisco, and a leading proponent of preventive medicine. medicine is currently practiced, he said, as part of a \"disease care system\" geared to reacting to the consequences of bad health instead of treating the underlying causes. more than 90 percent of heart disease, dr. ornish insists, is preventable. over the years, dr. ornish has led several projects showing that fundamental changes in diet , exercise and stress management can stop and even reverse heart disease. preventive programs cost money upfront, but can cut overall treatment costs to insurers by 30 percent or more, yet few insurers pay for preventive care. a third of people with health coverage switch insurers every year, so insurers reason that their investment in preventive health measures could become another company's gain. that attitude may be changing, though. last year, medicare agreed to cover a dietary program designed by dr. ornish. \"given the failures of high-tech medicine, these low-tech approaches are starting to get the attention they deserve,\" dr. ornish said. but high-tech remains in favor, despite recent studies raising doubts about the value to many patients of widely used medical devices like heart defibrillators . the lucrative medical-device market in the united states is a favorite of venture capitalists these days. \"the medical technology race is a promise that we will continue to try to do everything we can,\" said david cassak, an editor at in vivo, which covers the medical-device industry. that may be a noble goal. but it is hardly a prescription for controlling costs. health care reformers say that treatments are justified when there is evidence of sound science and financial logic. that threshold, it seems, is not the standard today. studies done by researchers at dartmouth college show large differences in treatment, and costs, for elderly patients in their last few years of life in different parts of the country. and, they found, more aggressive and expensive treatment does not prolong life and may even shorten it. \"you need to move toward well-defined clinical guidelines based on medical evidence and better information throughout the health care system,\" said jonathan s. skinner, an economist at dartmouth. \"but that's not going to be easy, and it's going to be fraught with difficult choices.\"",

        "abstract": "phoenix the charm of the n.f.l. is that every once in a while, in its utterly controlled and contrived fashion, it goes so wonderfully meta that it folds in on itself. so we have the super bowl media day, which marries the american love of carnivals with its adoration of marketing. everyone is a prop, as players and coaches sit, swami style, in separate purple booths as the hoi polloi gather round. everyone chats simultaneously and says little. \"i don't have to answer your question,\" patriots tight end rob gronkowski explained, amiably. \"i can deflect it. that's how we're trained.\" or so it usually goes. except the seattle seahawks , a looser agglomeration of public personalities than the new england patriots, jumped the tracks. (\"i embrace media day because i don't care what you think, honestly,\" seahawks defensive lineman michael bennett told reporters. on the possibility of beating peyton manning and tom brady in consecutive super bowls, \"it's like madonna and marilyn monroe.\") the seahawks' most glorious smack talk came on the subject of footballs deflated below the league standard. the patriots were found to possess 11 such footballs in their a.f.c. championship game against the indianapolis colts. quarterback tom brady has a stated preference for softer footballs. the n.f.l. has investigated this allegation, after its desultory fashion. its lead investigator says it could be weeks before the investigation concludes. or peters out, as the case may be. seahawks cornerback richard sherman gained a national reputation after he issued a chest-thumping diatribe following a big victory a year ago. he is in fact a thoughtful man, and he pieced two and two together this past sunday. he noted that robert k. kraft, the wealthy owner of the patriots, is a close and reliable ally of roger goodell, the wealthy commissioner of the n.f.l. \"will they be punished?\" sherman asked of the patriots. \"probably not. not as long as robert kraft and goodell are still taking pictures at their respective homes. i think he was just at kraft's house last week for the a.f.c. championship. talk about conflict of interest.\" sherman's desire to connect the dots of wealth and influence did not please kraft. he deplaned in phoenix on monday and unburdened himself. like his coach, bill belichick who showed up for media day in rime-of-the-ancient-beachcomber wear, with old jeans, an old sweatshirt, and old flip-flops kraft portrayed himself as a man of science, talking of his careful study of the physics of ball inflation. then the owner tossed down. many, he said, have made \"scarring accusations against our coach, quarterback and staff.\" if the league is \"not able to definitively determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs,\" kraft said, \"i would expect and hope that the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular, coach belichick and tom brady.\" kraft's statement rewarded the inner deconstructionist, not the least his use of \"definitively.\" that sets a high adjectival bar. it is possible that league investigators, an indefatigable lot, will locate a video of belichick and brady chuckling and holding footballs up to the light as they insert pins and deflate each one. anything short of that standard, however, and kraft wants that league apology gift-wrapped. fox sports reported recently that league investigators had focused on a \"person of interest\" a lone ball boy in the patriots' employ. he was seen, we're told by sources unknown, taking the footballs into the men's room. perhaps the league has unearthed the most assertive ball boy in history. but it sounds akin to federal prosecutors focusing intently on the gambino crime family before targeting the kid who delivers pizza pies to the crime headquarters. image seahawks cornerback richard sherman showing off his dance moves tuesday during the super bowl's media day at us airways center in phoenix. seattle is set to play new england on sunday. 1 / 12 fortunately, we can turn again to richard sherman. he sat in his purple booth on media day and returned to the question of those buddies kraft and goodell. \"did all these people come out and support him after the ray rice thing? or was it robert kraft?\" sherman asked. \"who was the first person to call him and support him? give it to me.\" kraft, in fact, was one of the very first owners to offer comfort to goodell through his many dark nights last year. in the autumn, kraft sat for an interview with the cbs anchor charlie rose. rose, who is a painfully accommodating fellow, lauded kraft who was identified as the master kraftsman for having a team valued at $2.6 billion. their chitchat then detoured to that video of baltimore ravens running back ray rice delivering his left hook to the head of his fiancee in an elevator. don't blame goodell, kraft told rose. \"he had no knowledge of this video.\" a subsequent and no doubt definitive because the league says so n.f.l. investigation determined that goodell had not seen the video. kraft showed up at media day and poked at sherman, accusing him the nerve! of engaging in personal marketing. it's important to realize that as the n.f.l. brands itself across the collective forehead of america, it is intent on stamping out the personality of individual players, from banning end zone dances to post-quarterback sack boogaloos to stomping on the power of the players union. sherman didn't much seem to care tuesday. \"i kind of go to the beat of my own drum,\" he noted. that day ended on a curious note. the n.f.l. quickly transcribes and disseminates highlights from all of the various players in their various booths. so with expectation i turned to the sherman transcript. it included his quote about the beat of his own drum. i did not find his comments on kraft and goodell. maybe the n.f.l. wasn't so meta after all.",

        "title": "miranda warning need tied to age by supreme court.",
        "abstract": "washington the supreme court issued four decisions in criminal cases on thursday, including one ruling that a suspect's age must be taken into consideration in deciding whether to issue miranda warnings. the court split 5-to-4 on that question, with the majority saying that greater care must be taken when children are questioned by the police. the case involved a 13-year-old middle school student in chapel hill, n.c. the student, identified only by his initials in the court's decision, confessed to two home break-ins after he was removed from class and questioned for more than half an hour in a school conference room by police officers and school administrators. people in police custody must be given the familiar warnings based on miranda v. arizona before questioning if their answers are to be used against them in court. the question in thursday's case, j.d.b. v. north carolina , no. 09-11121, was how to determine if the student was indeed in custody. judges generally make that determination by asking whether a \"reasonable person\" in the circumstances would have felt free to leave. the north carolina supreme court, refusing to suppress the student's confession, ruled that consideration of a juvenile suspect's age did not figure in that reasonable-person analysis. justice sonia sotomayor, writing for the majority, said that a 13-year-old would surely feel less free to leave a school conference room \"than, say, a parent volunteer on school grounds to chaperone an event, or an adult from the community on school grounds to attend a basketball game.\" \"in short,\" justice sotomayor wrote, \"officers and judges need no imaginative powers, knowledge of developmental psychology, training in cognitive science, or expertise in social and cultural anthropology to account for a child's age. they simply need the common sense to know that a 7-year-old is not a 13-year-old and neither is an adult.\" the court did not decide whether the student had in fact been in police custody, returning the case to the lower courts for further examination of the question in light of its ruling. justices anthony m. kennedy, ruth bader ginsburg, stephen g. breyer and elena kagan joined the majority opinion. in dissent, justice samuel a. alito jr. said the majority had injected uncertainty into what had been a clear approach. \"personal characteristics of suspects have consistently been rejected or ignored as irrelevant under a one-size-fits-all reasonable-person standard,\" justice alito wrote, adding, \"there is no denying that, by incorporating age into its analysis, the court is embarking on a new expansion of the established custody standard.\" justice alito wrote that the majority had failed to explain how age is different from other personal characteristics that are ignored under the usual analysis, like intelligence and education. \"bit by bit,\" he wrote of the majority's approach, \"miranda will lose the clarity and ease of application that has long been viewed as one of its chief justifications.\" chief justice john g. roberts jr. and justices antonin scalia and clarence thomas joined the dissent. federal power in a second decision, the court unanimously ruled that a woman convicted of poisoning a former friend is free to argue that congress exceeded its constitutional authority in enacting the law under which she was charged. the decision addressed only the woman's standing to make the argument and left open the question of whether her argument was correct. still, the decision in the case, bond v. united states , no. 09-1227, will be closely scrutinized by lawyers involved in challenges to the recent health care law. in sometimes soaring language, justice kennedy, writing for the court, affirmed the value of dual state and federal sovereignty. \"by denying any one government complete jurisdiction over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power,\" justice kennedy wrote. \"when government acts in excess of its lawful powers, that liberty is at stake.\" the case at hand arose from a domestic dispute. carol a. bond, a pennsylvania woman, grew enraged on learning that her husband was the father of her best friend's child and retaliated by spreading harmful chemicals on the friend's car, mailbox and doorknob. such matters are usually handled by the local police and prosecutors. in ms. bond's case, though, federal prosecutors charged her with using unconventional weapons in violation of a law based on the chemical weapons convention of 1993, a treaty concerned with terrorists and rogue states. ms. bond argued that congress did not have the constitutional power to authorize her prosecution under the law. she cited the 10th amendment, which says that \"the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.\" but an appeals court ruled that only states can invoke the amendment, a decision the supreme court reversed. exclusionary rule in a 7-to-2 decision, the court ruled that evidence obtained from a search that was lawful when it was conducted need not be suppressed if the supreme court later determines that searches of that sort violate the fourth amendment. justice alito, writing for the court in davis v. united states , no. 09-11328, said the purposes of the exclusionary rule, which can require the suppression of evidence obtained through police misconduct, would not be served by applying the new decision retroactively to suppress evidence. \"about all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work,\" he wrote. \"it is one thing for the criminal 'to go free because the constable has blundered,' \" justice alito went on, quoting judge benjamin n. cardozo's famous formulation. \"it is quite another to set the criminal free because the constable has scrupulously adhered to governing law.\" justice breyer, in a dissent joined by justice ginsburg, said the majority opinion was part of a trend to \"undermine the exclusionary rule.\" sentencing the court also ruled that federal judges may not impose longer prison sentences in order to promote rehabilitation. the decision in the case, tapia v. united states , no. 10-5400, was unanimous. justice kagan, writing for the court, said the relevant federal law, which instructed judges that \"imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting correction and rehabilitation,\" dictated the result. class actions the court issued a fifth decision, smith v. bayer corp ., no. 09-1205, concerning the application of the anti-injunction act to dueling class actions. justice kagan summarized the decision from the bench, explaining that a federal judge had erred in blocking a state court action. before she started, justice kagan apologized for the complexity of the decision. it would help, she told visitors to the supreme court seeking to follow what she was about to say, to have a law degree and a cup of coffee.",

        "abstract": "the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight 370 has left investigators, aviation experts and the authorities in several countries at a loss to explain what happened. and the few slender clues that have emerged only seem to lead to more questions. as the search broadens and the international inquiries continue, matthew l. wald, a correspondent for the new york times, answers some basic questions: q. the times has reported that malaysian military radar systems saw the plane climb and dive. does this indicate that a hijacker was at the controls? a. not necessarily. aerodynamics experts say that if an airplane is set up to fly a straight path at a given altitude, it will eventually vary from that altitude, for two reasons. first, it will burn off fuel, and a lot of that fuel is stored in the tanks at the jet's wingtips, which are behind the airplane's center of gravity. as the back of the plane gets lighter, the tail will rise and the nose will fall. as the plane dives, it will pick up speed. but with more speed there will be more lift and the nose will rise. the aircraft will then climb until speed decreases and the nose will point down again, repeating the cycle in an oscillation. second, if the plane flies close to the speed of sound, then the center of pressure and the center of lift will move toward the back of the aircraft, pushing the nose down. other factors at play include the accuracy of the military radar in estimating altitude. the malaysian military has not described its radar's capabilities, so if the plane were recorded at 45,000 feet, what is the range of uncertainty in that measurement? turns would be much harder to explain without human intervention, but a plane that encounters certain natural weather phenomena can turn. q. how easy is it to switch off the communications equipment on the plane? a. you have to know what you are looking for, but it is not that difficult. just about everything on the plane has a circuit breaker, which is accessible to the pilots. the equipment could be legitimately shut off for several reasons. one reason is that if the equipment stops working, the solution often involves powering down the equipment and then powering it up again, the way someone would do with a frozen computer. also, if a component has a short circuit and overheats or catches fire, there has to be a way to turn it off. this is why transponders (most planes carry more than one) can easily be switched off from the cockpit. q. if the communications equipment has been switched off, is there anything else onboard that could still send a signal? a. the plane is built to communicate with satellites and there is a second system, not easily controlled from the cockpit, to accomplish that. even when it is not in use, the system goes through a \"handshake\" procedure with satellites, about once an hour. this procedure is akin to a cellphone that trades messages with the nearest cell tower, even though it never leaves the user's pocket, so the cell system knows where to find it should a call come in. that handshake does not include data, experts say, but it does offer a way to establish the approximate location of the plane once an hour. american experts say they knew little about this system until this week, when it yielded a clue, albeit a weak one, to the malaysian plane's location. q. will we ever know what happened? a. some investigators are warning that we may never know what happened. the cockpit voice recorder, which would be crucial in determining if the crash were the result of a hijacking or some other criminal act, captures just two hours of sound, continuously recording over earlier information. but this flight apparently lasted six hours and the period that matters most probably was not within the final two hours. recovering the voice recorder also presumes that searchers locate the wreckage of the plane. the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder (which has a 25-hour loop) have battery-powered \"pingers\" attached, which emit a sound that can travel several miles through the water. their batteries only last an average of 30 days. searchers in other crashes have found the boxes without the help of \"pingers,\" but it is much more difficult. q. how could a boeing 777 simply vanish? aren't they always tracked by radar or satellites? a. radar coverage is not universal, especially over water. in areas without radar, pilots are generally required to radio in their positions at fixed intervals, mostly to assure that air traffic controllers can keep aircraft out of one another's way. between intervals, something could go wrong. planes like the 777 also have automatic systems that send out data on engine performance and other technical functions. those signals go to a maintenance base, not to air traffic control. air france used those signals to help determine what happened when its flight 447 disappeared over the equatorial atlantic, and the satellite system installed on the malaysia airlines jet has yielded clues about where to look for it, though not its precise location. q. plane crashes most often happen on landing or takeoff, but this flight vanished almost an hour after takeoff, when it was cruising. what could cause a plane to crash at that point in a flight? a. in three crashes at sea in the last few years, the aircraft's speed-sensing systems have malfunctioned. in two of those cases, crews failed to diagnose and cope with the problem. (in the third, there was probably nothing they could have done.) a deliberate act by a pilot, terrorism or an attack in the cockpit could be other causes. q. why would the authorities not have found debris from the plane after so many days of searching? a. one reason is that much of the searching was done in what authorities now believe were the wrong places. in the first days, the focus was on the waters of the gulf of thailand and the south china sea, close to where the plane was when ground controllers last heard from the pilots or saw signals from its transponders. military radar data then emerged showing that the plane had turned far off course and flown westward toward the strait of malacca and the andaman sea, so some searchers were shifted there. then satellite signals indicated that the plane had kept flying for hours more, hugely expanding the possible search area. by the time the primary focus narrowed again to the southern indian ocean, nearly two weeks had gone by, time in which the elements could have scattered or sunk some debris that might have been visible immediately after the crash. image a member of the military looked out of a helicopter during a search-and-rescue mission off the tho chu islands of vietnam on monday. credit athit perawongmetha/reuters q. how far from its last known location could the aircraft have strayed? a. while we know fairly precisely where the plane was when contact was lost, we have only inferences from radar and satellite data about how long it remained in the air afterward or which way it flew, so it is hard to say with certainty. the plane had enough fuel on board to complete its scheduled journey to beijing, 2,500 miles from kuala lumpur, so it conceivably could have kept flying for seven hours or more. q. are there any signs that terrorism might have been involved? a. no group is known to have claimed to have destroyed the plane. beyond that, not enough is known to speculate. q. if the plane had a major malfunction, wouldn't the pilots have called for help and sent distress signals? a. pilots have a mantra for setting priorities in an emergency: aviate, navigate, communicate. the first priority is to fly the airplane. telling air traffic controllers on the ground what is going on comes third, since doing so is unlikely to instantly yield any help with the crisis in the cockpit, whatever it may be. if the pilots are fighting to keep the plane aloft, they may not have time to use the radio. q. could one of the pilots have crashed the plane deliberately? a. it's been known to happen: the crashes of an egyptair flight from kennedy international airport in 1999 and a silkair flight in indonesia in 1997 were attributed to intentional acts by cockpit crew members. but nothing is yet known publicly to suggest that that happened on the malaysia airlines flight. image debris from air france flight 447 in the atlantic ocean. credit brazil's air force, via associated press q. have other planes disappeared in this way in recent years? a. there is no record of big planes simply disappearing, though they may take some time to find. a few pieces of debris from air france flight 447 were spotted floating in the atlantic the day after the plane crashed in june 2009, but it took five days to find most of the wreckage. small aircraft may be missing for much longer if they go down in remote areas. steve fossett, the daredevil adventurer who flew around the world solo in a plane and set records in a balloon, took off in his private plane in nevada on sept. 3, 2007, and his remains were found in october 2008.",

        "title": "i.b.m. inch closer on quantum computer.",
        "abstract": "i.b.m. is jumping into an area of computing that has, until now, been primarily the province of academia: the quest to build a quantum computer. a computer that took advantage of the oddities of quantum physics could solve in seconds certain problems that would occupy present-day computers for billions of years. but for now, it is impossible to build such a computer because the bits of information it would need for the calculations fall apart before a calculation can be completed. the problem is, in essence, like trying to knit a sweater with yarn that unravels before the first purl. on tuesday, i.b.m. researchers will present experimental results that they say put them close to solving this problem, both by lengthening the lifetime of the quantum bits of information and by quickening the pace of computation. the presentation will take place at a meeting of the american physical society in boston. \"in the past, people have said, maybe it's 50 years away, it's a dream, maybe it'll happen sometime,\" said mark b. ketchen, manager of the physics of information group at i.b.m.'s thomas j. watson research center in yorktown heights, n.y. \"i used to think it was 50. now i'm thinking like it's 15 or a little more. it's within reach. it's within our lifetime. it's going to happen.\" many university researchers have done good work solving the basic science problems, dr. ketchen said, but \"it's going take an i.b.m. in the end to put it together.\" it's still too early for i.b.m. to have a commercial product in mind, but computer scientists are encouraged that the company is paying attention. scott aaronson, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the massachusetts institute of technology, called i.b.m.'s work \"a cause for cautious optimism\" in the development of quantum computers. \"it looks very interesting,\" dr. aaronson said of the i.b.m. research. \"basically, it's another step in continuing progress.\" while a working quantum computer is still quite a few years away, there have been a number of advances over the last couple of years, and the i.b.m. one is just among the most recent. these days, the path to the future now looks more like a series of very hard engineering problems rather than an uphill fight against physics. current computers perform their calculations using 1's and 0's, with each binary digit called a \"bit\" of information. in quantum mechanics, multiple possibilities exist at once, and a quantum bit qubit, for short is not necessarily a \"1\" or a \"0\" but a combination of both. by stringing together qubits, a quantum computer could perform a multitude of calculations simultaneously. for certain problems like searching databases or factoring very large numbers the basis of today's encryption techniques quantum computers could produce an answer in days or maybe even seconds, whereas the fastest conventional computer would take longer than 13.7 billion years. the i.b.m. researchers are building quantum computer components out of electronic circuits containing superconductors, materials that carry electricity without electrical resistance. when cooled to a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, the circuits act as qubits. the problem is that a qubit becomes scrambled in short order, and the information it carries turns into gibberish. when physicists started experiments a little more than a decade ago, a qubit lasted only a few billionths of a second. (an alternate approach, trapping ions in electric and magnetic fields, can produce longer-lived qubits. but the superconducting circuit approach takes advantage of current computer chip technologies.) in the latest i.b.m. results, which build on a technique developed by robert j. schoelkopf, a physics professor at yale, a qubit lasted as long as one-10,000th of a second. even though that is still not long enough for perfect calculations, it is almost good enough for error correction algorithms to detect and fix any mistakes. \"we're just crossing this threshold,\" dr. ketchen said, \"which is a big morale booster that says, gee, this is becoming doable.\" below the threshold, generating reliable answers is impossible. \"no matter how many qubits you had, you couldn't even get one effectively good one because of the error rates being too high,\" he said. the progress is promising enough that it is time to start thinking about related challenges, such as how to program a quantum computer or how to extract the answer that a quantum computer has calculated.",

        "abstract": "the coaching philosophy of notre dame 's mike brey once revolved around scoring 100 points. but an injury to the star forward luke harangody nearly a month ago forced the irish to have an extreme makeover. the results have been remarkable. notre dame has won five consecutive games, and the fighting irish essentially eliminated any doubt about their place in the n.c.a.a. tournament by beating seton hall , 68-56, on wednesday in the second round of the big east conference tournament at madison square garden. the irish will play no. 2 pitt on thursday night. the loss most likely puts seton hall (19-12) on the wrong side of the n.c.a.a. bubble. seton hall has a bizarre resume that includes no bad losses, few good wins and a ratings percentage index that will end up in the mid-50s. notre dame appeared destined for the national invitation tournament until harangody was hurt against seton hall on feb. 11. the irish lost that game and their next two. from there, they decided to dedicate themselves to a more methodical offense and tougher defense. on wednesday, the irish showed how harangody, never known as a particularly interested or ardent defender, can fit in with the new philosophy. with harangody on the bench, notre dame was blitzed at the start. the irish trailed by 11-2 with five minutes gone in the first half, but harangody gave them a jolt when he entered the game. he scored 15 of his 20 points in the first half, and the irish defense only gave up 21 first-half points after yielding 11 in the first five minutes. the play that best epitomized notre dame's effort was a full-body dive out of bounds by the senior point guard tory jackson in the first half that led to a breakaway layup by harangody. that passion and energy have been the hallmark of this irish makeover. and it has bred a confidence that has notre dame believing it can keep on winning in new york.",

        "title": "how does it feel, chief justice roberts, to hone a dylan quote?.",
        "abstract": "washington justice antonin scalia loved opera, but he also had a soft spot for bob dylan. in a 2010 dissent , for instance, he chastised the majority for refusing to answer key questions in a case about sexually explicit text messages because technology was evolving so fast. \"the-times-they-are-a-changin' is a feeble excuse for disregard of duty,\" he wrote. justice scalia was in good company. mr. dylan has long been the most cited songwriter in judicial opinions, said alex b. long , a law professor at the university of tennessee and the author of a 2012 study, \"the freewheelin' judiciary: a bob dylan anthology,\" published in the fordham urban law journal . it was a 2008 dissent from chief justice john g. roberts jr. that really opened the floodgates, professor long said. \"judges' inclination to go to dylan has actually increased in the past few years, probably as a result of roberts's dissent in that case,\" he said. dylan citations are booming in other fields as well. a study last year found 213 references to his lyrics in medical papers. (one was called \" nitric oxide and inflammation: the answer is blowing in the wind .\") but a few dylan fans frowned when they read the chief justice's 2008 dissent. his quotation, from \"like a rolling stone,\" was not a faithful reflection of what mr. dylan had sung. though the justices occasionally correct their opinions long after they are first issued , the quotation has remained unchanged and incomplete. almost eight years later, chief justice roberts this month finally broke his public silence on the matter during an interview at a law school in boston, explaining why and how he had chosen to quote the lyric. in the process, he illuminated the special role mr. dylan plays in american jurisprudence. the 2008 case concerned standing the requirement that parties have a direct, personal stake in a litigation. the chief justice argued that the plaintiffs in the case before him, who were collection agencies for pay-phone companies, lacked standing. his analysis was tightly reasoned and characteristically lucid. then he put the dylan lyric in a spot usually reserved for a citation to legal precedent: \"'when you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.' bob dylan, like a rolling stone, on highway 61 revisited (columbia records 1965).\" what mr. dylan actually sings, of course, is, \"when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\" in the interview on feb. 3, dean john f. o'brien of new england law, boston, probed the matter, starting with a general question. \"what was your objective in quoting bob dylan?\" chief justice roberts, a little defensively, said there was a place for a bit of levity and license in legal writing. \"an intelligent layperson appreciates bob dylan's poetry, if not his music,\" he said. \"it was, after all, in a dissent, so you have a little bit more leeway there.\" \"bob dylan captured the whole notion behind standing,\" he added. \"in that case, the party didn't have anything at stake in the case and had nothing to lose, and the case should have been thrown out on that basis.\" \"i know bob dylan would have agreed with that,\" chief justice roberts said, to laughter. then professor o'brien asked about the missing word. \"that is as performed,\" chief justice roberts responded. \"the liner notes show that it doesn't have the 'ain't' in it.\" it is true that mr. dylan's own website reproduces the lyric as chief justice roberts had. (the liner notes on \"highway 61 revisited,\" though, did not set out the lyrics. the back cover was instead devoted to an extended surrealistic poem from mr. dylan that seemed aimed at confounding the intelligent layperson.) why did chief justice roberts use the published version? \"i'm a bit of a textualist,\" he said, to laughter. professor o'brien, who seemed to think the song as sung was the superior source, had a quick retort. \"if not an originalist,\" he said. there is a reason mr. dylan is so popular among judges, professor long said: his lyrics are pithy, memorable and pointed. \"they're great lines on their own,\" he said, \"and they're also really useful to convey to the legal concept they're trying to get across.\" the most cited dylan lyric, he said, came from \"subterranean homesick blues.\" when judges want to reject expert testimony about an obvious point, say, they are apt to remind readers that \"you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.\" mr. dylan will not maintain his exalted stature forever. \"the beatles and springsteen are still up there,\" professor long said. \"billy joel is making his move. as the bench gets a little bit younger, you see guys like billy joel pop in there.\" the youngest member of the supreme court, justice elena kagan, 55, has already moved on to the music of the 1980s. in a 2013 case concerning signs on trucks, justice kagan gave a hypothetical example of one: \"how am i driving? call <phone>.\" that was a reference to \"<phone>/jenny,\" tommy tutone's indelible 1981 hit, which reached no. 4 on the billboard hot 100 chart and will still get people of a certain age onto the dance floor at college reunions. still, it will be hard to displace mr. dylan. the day after the supreme court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage last year, justice scalia sang a song to justice ruth bader ginsburg. it was that same dylan favorite: \"the times they are a-changin'.\"",

        "title": "veto halts bill for jury duty by noncitizens in california.",
        "abstract": "los angeles breaking with democrats in the state legislature, gov. jerry brown vetoed a bill on monday that would have made california the first state to allow immigrants who are not citizens to serve on juries, saying that the responsibility should come only with citizenship. as leader of a state with 3.5 million noncitizens who are legal permanent residents, mr. brown in recent weeks had signed into law numerous measures that put california at the vanguard of expanding immigrant rights, including granting driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. on saturday, he signed several such bills, most prominently legislation stopping local law officers from detaining immigrants and transferring them to federal authorities unless they have committed certain serious crimes. and he agreed in august to let noncitizens monitor polls for elections. but the governor drew the line at allowing legal immigrants to serve on juries. \"jury service, like voting, is quintessentially a prerogative and responsibility of citizenship,\" mr. brown said in a brief veto message . \"this bill would permit lawful permanent residents who are not citizens to serve on a jury. i don't think that's right.\" some legal scholars had said that the measure raised profound questions about what rights and responsibilities belonged to citizens alone, and a number of newspapers published editorials urging the governor to veto the bill after the democratic-controlled legislature passed it, with most republicans opposing it. it \"calls into question the very meaning of citizenship,\" the sacramento bee wrote in august, saying the legislation would provide an incentive to immigrants to avoid becoming citizens. \"why should green-card holders become citizens if they can enjoy the rights of citizenship?\" supporters said the measure would make it easier to assemble jury pools and grant legal immigrants a jury of their peers. while mr. brown faced pressure from fellow democrats and advocates to sign the other bills giving immigrants new rights, there was no such campaign to convince him that allowing noncitizens to serve on juries was a pressing matter. by contrast, immigrants' rights groups held rallies and letter-writing campaigns urging mr. brown to sign the bill stopping local law enforcement agencies from detaining immigrants and transferring them to federal authorities unless they had committed certain serious crimes. mr. brown had vetoed similar legislation before, but his staff worked with immigrant advocates to devise a compromise that expands the kinds of crimes that would allow local authorities to hold on to arrested immigrants, like felony domestic violence and d.u.i. convictions. under the new law, known as the trust act, unless immigrants have committed certain serious crimes, they cannot be detained past when they would otherwise become eligible for release. \"while washington waffles on immigration, california's forging ahead,\" mr. brown said in a statement announcing his approval of the law on saturday. \"i'm not waiting.\" the batch of new laws also included one that would allow immigrants without legal status to be admitted to the state bar and practice law in california. there was little outcry about the governor's veto from immigrants' rights groups on monday. instead, they praised mr. brown for signing bills that they said amounted to \"enormous momentum for immigrants.\" \"we have really created a counterweight to other states like arizona, that's really the story,\" said jon rodney, a spokesman for the california immigrant policy center. assemblyman bob wieckowski, a democrat from the bay area and the chairman of the judiciary committee, which wrote the bill, said he did not plan to ask the legislature to override the veto, but would introduce similar legislation next year. \"i hope and believe this is just a temporary mistake,\" mr. wieckowski said of the veto. \"he has shown some enlightened thinking he has just signed a bill that says even if you're undocumented you can go in front of a jury, so i hope he gets some more thoughts from constitutionally enlightened people around the country, and is convinced this is the right thing to do.\" mr. wieckowski said he still believed barring immigrants from jury duty was a sign of prejudice, particularly in a state where legal permanent residents make up nearly 10 percent of the population. he had believed mr. brown would sign the bill, he said, because the governor approved legislation allowing legal permanent residents to serve as poll workers. assemblyman rocky chavez, a republican from san diego and the most vocal opponent of the jury duty bill, praised the governor for stopping a bill that \"attempted to solve a problem that did not exist.\" \"the debate over this bill attempted to create a social wedge in our communities over our justice system,\" he said in a statement. \"the phrase 'jury of your peers' still means something in our criminal justice system.\"",

        "abstract": "chicago matt blunt, the governor of missouri and a republican, announced late tuesday that he would not seek re-election this fall, a decision that stunned many in the state's political circles and threw the anticipated alignment of missouri's election into disarray. mr. blunt, who had been widely expected to seek a second term, released a video address in which, seated beside his wife, melanie, he told state residents that he had completed his promised agenda for the state. \"the habit of politicians is to remain in office and the desire to prove oneself in the next election is strong,\" mr. blunt said. \"after a great deal of thought and prayer, and with the knowledge that we have achieved virtually everything i set out to accomplish, and more, i will not seek a second term in the upcoming election. because i feel we have changed what i wanted to change in the first term there is not the same sense of mission for a second.\" mr. blunt had been expected to face a difficult re-election bid, appearing headed for a battle with jay nixon, a democrat, the state's attorney general. before tuesday, the showdown between the two seemed to have already begun: both were aggressively raising money and regularly clashing publicly on state issues. mr. blunt's announcement leaves the republican party with no certain nominee in the race. \"his approval ratings had been weak and there had been several open sores within his administration,\" said dave robertson, a professor of political science at the university of missouri, st. louis. \"the combination of that and the economic outlook that has really deteriorated in just a few weeks any incumbent governor is going to have a very difficult time dealing with that.\" mr. nixon, in a statement released late tuesday, wished mr. blunt well. \"i will continue to focus on changing the direction of our state so that more missourians have access to health care, more missourians can find good-paying jobs and more missouri children can get the quality education they deserve,\" mr. nixon said. mr. blunt, 37, had been among the state's youngest governors when he was elected and had been expected by many to pursue a long political career in the state; the son of representative roy blunt, he came from a family of political leaders. the governor has taken credit for repairing the state's medicaid program and balancing the state budget, but he has also wrestled with several problems, including what mr. robertson described as a mini-scandal. a former state lawyer, scott eckersley, has filed a lawsuit against the governor's office that involves the destruction of official e-mail messages. mr. eckersley says he was fired after he pointed out that the destruction of the messages violated the state's open records laws.",

        "abstract": "intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, reported a sharp decline in its quarterly profits on tuesday as its financial performance follows the fading fortunes of the personal computer industry. the earnings decline points to the challenges facing the big chip maker as it struggles to make the transition beyond its lucrative stronghold as the leading supplier of the chips that power pcs. as people do more and more of their computing on tablets and smartphones, personal computer sales are falling. the company reported net income to $2.05 billion , a decline of 25 percent from $2.74 billion in the period a year earlier. intel's earnings fell to 40 cents a share, compared with 53 cents a share a year ago. the quarter's performance was just below wall street's average estimate of 41 cents a share, as compiled by thomson reuters. revenue in the first quarter slipped to $12.58 billion, down from $12.91 billion in the first quarter of 2012. that was in line with analysts' forecast of $12.6 billion. in after-hours trading, intel shares were flat. in the regular trading session, the company's shares added 54 cents a share, or 2.5 percent, to close at $21.92. in a conference call to discuss the results, intel executives were more optimistic about the rest of the year. stacy j. smith, the chief financial officer, said the company should return to growth in the second half, with \"low single-digit growth\" for the year. an improving economy should help, as well as new products like its haswell chips, a power-saving processor that supports touch-screen computing on ultrabook computers, which are hybrids of notebooks and tablets. haswell chips, mr. smith said, will be in products that will begin to ship this quarter. a year ago, intel was not positioned to follow demand into higher-growing markets like hybrid and tablet computers, said paul s. otellini, the chief executive, who plans to retire in may. now it is, he said. \"never before has our ability to compete across the spectrum of computing been greater,\" mr. otellini said. intel's business of selling high-end chips to power the server computers in data centers is growing. its data center group reported a 7 percent increase in revenue in the quarter, to $2.6 billion. but strength elsewhere is not enough to offset intel's dependence on the personal computer market. in 2012, the company's pc chip division accounted for 64 percent of intel's total revenue and 89 percent of its operating income. last week, the research firm idc reported that worldwide personal computer shipments declined by nearly 14 percent in the first quarter of this year, the biggest drop since the research firm began tracking quarterly pc sales in 1994.",

        "title": "microsoft looks to windows 10 for a jolt in the mobile realm.",
        "abstract": "seattle optimism is a renewable resource at microsoft. in 2011, the company, in a belated attempt to catch up with apple and google in the smartphone world, announced a partnership with nokia, the finnish device maker. \"there are other mobile ecosystems,\" nokia and microsoft executives said in a joint letter at the time. \"we will disrupt them.\" last year, with sales flagging, microsoft bought nokia's handset business for more than $7 billion, aiming to spur better results by more tightly coupling hardware and software. still, sales have not materialized. the global market share of the company's phones was just under 3 percent in the third quarter, lower than the year before. analysts, long skeptical about microsoft's mobile strategy, have largely thrown up their hands. and in perhaps the biggest slight of all, many mobile-app developers, who can make or break mobile technologies by supporting or ignoring them, are paying little or no attention to windows phone. cue that optimism. on wednesday, microsoft plans to unveil details about windows 10, a new operating system for pcs, at an event at its headquarters outside seattle. the operating system, the company says, will help win back developers by allowing them to more easily adapt pc applications to mobile devices. the company hopes it will also increase the availability of applications for and lift sales of the company's smartphones. the move is the biggest effort yet by satya nadella, who took over as chief executive nearly a year ago, to save the company's moribund smartphone business. so far, mr. nadella has put microsoft's overall mobile offerings on a more practical path. last year, he released the company's office suite of applications for apple ios and google android devices, and he improved tools for developers of nearly all device brands. the tactics have helped propel the company's stock to a nearly 15-year high. ben thompson , an independent technology analyst who once helped manage microsoft's relationship with windows developers, said he was \"pleased with microsoft's strategy for the first time in a long time.\" but the company's attempt to make microsoft's mobile platform relevant, he said, remains a challenge. \"microsoft can't make that happen,\" mr. thompson said. \"it's up to developers. i think the situation is pretty hopeless from that perspective.\" microsoft declined to provide an interview with an executive before its event this week. but it is clearly not giving up. \"we're making steady progress toward our vision of giving people a single windows experience across a full range of devices,\" frank x. shaw, a company spokesman, said in a statement. \"with windows 10, we're moving to a more unified windows platform for phones, tablets and pc, helping developers do more with their code.\" microsoft hastens to say that its app store has over 560,000 apps, most of them for smartphones, up 60 percent from a year ago. (apple and google have said that each of their app stores has more than a million apps.) and microsoft says it offers from 85 to 95 percent of the apps that people tell the company they want on a smartphone. netflix, facebook, spotify and other a-list apps are all available for windows phone. yet microsoft's numbers do not capture the slim pickings of other popular apps. people searching for lyft, hbo go or snapchat will find no windows phone option. nor will one find runkeeper, a popular mobile app for joggers. \"the challenge is android and ios are innovating so quickly,\" said glenn kelman , the chief executive of redfin , an online real estate firm that does not make a windows phone app but makes one for ios and android. \"i think we could consider other platforms if it wasn't so much work to keep up with the two major mobile platforms.\" image satya nadella last month at his first shareholders meeting as microsoft's chief executive. credit jason redmond/reuters apps are not the only reason people buy smartphones, but they are a big part of it. and tepid support for the software by device makers and wireless carriers is a reason they avoid certain models. executives at huawei , a chinese company with a fast-growing mobile business, have said they are discontinuing future windows phone devices because of slow sales. microsoft's relationship with samsung, which makes some devices that run windows phone, is also in trouble, but because of the nokia acquisition. in a filing late last year in a lawsuit between the two companies over a patent-licensing deal, samsung said the nokia deal created a conflict of interest for microsoft, which no longer had an incentive to promote samsung's windows phone models. \"until microsoft stops competing with its ecosystem, windows phone as a platform won't go anywhere,\" said chetan sharma , an independent mobile analyst. there are pockets of strength for microsoft in certain countries. in italy, for instance, windows phone accounted for 12.7 percent of smartphone sales in november, compared with 17 percent for the iphone, according to kantar worldpanel comtech , a research firm. in the united states, though, windows phone accounts for just 3 percent of sales, compared with 47 percent for the iphone, according to kantar. the low sales figures mean windows phone is rarely included in the plans at start-ups, where resources are particularly tight. \"that sort of view must be infuriating to microsoft, and rightfully so,\" adam grossman, co-founder of dark sky , which makes a popular new weather app for iphones and ipads, said by email. microsoft has long acknowledged the need to expand its app selection. the company has offered to finance the development of windows phone apps for prominent developers, in some cases paying for outside contractors to do the programming work, according to a former microsoft executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were confidential. but even that was not enough for the executive at one top mobile-game developer, who said microsoft gave up asking his company to support windows phone about a year ago. \"we need an actual market and large, global installed base to justify it,\" said this executive, who did not want to be named in order to preserve his relationship with microsoft. minecraft, one of the most popular mobile games, came out in december for windows phone, years after it was available on other platforms. and that happened after microsoft paid $2.5 billion to buy the developer of the game. in addition, some of the major apps on windows phone are either not as polished or are not updated as frequently as on other platforms. instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by facebook, came out on windows phone over a year ago, after a long delay, but it still does not include the ability to record video, a function that instagram introduced nearly two years ago. \"i think the door for a new operating system is closed for the time being,\" said benedict evans , a partner at the venture capital firm andreessen horowitz . that has not stopped anatoly ropotov , chief executive of game insight , a developer based in lithuania, from creating games for both windows phone and windows on pcs. in an email, mr. ropotov said windows phone would help his company reach consumers in emerging markets in southeast asia and elsewhere. \"lots of publishers are waking up to the fact that there's money to be made on the platform,\" he said. persuading other developers to change their attitude appears to be an uphill battle. but one area that could aid a windows phone turnaround is in applications for businesses, microsoft's traditional area of strength, since windows remains dominant in the workplace. chris yeh , senior vice president for product and platform at box, a cloud storage company, said his company would create windows 10 apps for both pcs and phones, regardless of whether microsoft is out of fashion in silicon valley. \"they've taken a pretty deep beating in public perception, especially in mobile,\" he said. \"but as soon as you leave this area and go to any company in the midwest or overseas, you're looking at companies with hundreds of thousands of employees with windows on their desktops. that's just the reality.\"",

        "abstract": "schaumburg, ill. man. meat. fire. it is supposed to be a foolproof formula. but the guy at the grill is frantic. he has a yard full of hungry guests, and he is fumbling to get the gas flaming properly. it is a memorial day weekend nightmare that calls into question the very essence of his suburban manhood. furtively, he dials the weber grill hot line for help, and janet olsen is on the line. \"quick, i need to talk to a man,\" he says curtly. for ms. olsen, 67, it was yet another caller insisting that no woman could possibly grasp a grilling issue. with 14 years on the job, she calmly but firmly explains that she will be able to handle the problem. if the man is especially upset, she suggests, \"you might want to grab a beer and just listen for a while.\" at the weber hot line center here, this is the busiest week of the year, as thousands of befuddled grillers (overwhelmingly male) are being rescued by a team of about 40 grilling experts (almost all of them women). some questions are more tricky than others. \"so i've got this squirrel,\" one caller informed ms. olsen. \"so how do i cook it?\" since squirrel-cooking is not in the weber catalog, ms. olsen told the man he could probably find some answers online . ms. olsen, who was widowed at 51 and has pictures of her grandchildren on her cubicle walls, does not rattle easily. \"i'm good at what i do,\" she said. \"i don't cry\" unlike some of her male callers \"though i have thrown a headset.\" in much of america, grilling is both an art and a science, a pursuit worthy of such rigor that weber recently opened a grill academy here that offers lectures, tests and cooking lessons. students are people who sell weber products, like the extravagant new summit grill center with social area, which runs about $5,000, and the sear station, which reaches temperatures of 700 to 800 degrees. it has been a long haul since george stephen, weber's founder, invented the covered kettle grill in 1954 and drove his contraption from hardware store to hardware store, selling his product as a revolutionary way to dine and socialize in the backyard. william brohaugh, the author of \"the grill of victory\" (2006 emmis books), says grilling strikes an emotional chord because it evokes such fond memories of family life. at 57, he can close his eyes and smell the steak sizzling in the backyard of his wisconsin house, as his father, earl, an auto mechanic, tended the fire. to this day, he said, he doesn't order steak in restaurants \"because they're never as good as my dad could make them on the grill.\" the male dominance of the grilling world has traditionally been regarded as a legacy of the caveman ethos, the notion that controlling fire is a way to master the universe. but elizabeth karmel, a barbecue chef who operates a web site, girlsatthegrill.com , sees another explanation. until the 1980s, when gas-powered grills emerged, cooking out meant working with charcoal. \"building a charcoal fire was dirty work, a man's work,\" she said. \"but that's changing.\" barbecue it is a noun in the south, something a person eats is known as \"low and slow,\" cooking at lower temperatures for longer periods. grilling is conducted at high levels of heat for short periods of time. grilling soared with postwar suburbanization. weber today has retailers in more than 30 countries. (south africans favor wart hog on the grill.) \"you can make a great barbecue on a little backyard grill,\" said ms. karmel, who is the executive chef at the hill country restaurants in new york and washington . \"it's the knowledge, not the size, that really counts.\" the weber grill academy, which opened in january, includes a large lecture hall that could fit at a big ten college campus. at the door, a bronze george stephen is grilling steaks (they look a tad overdone). the school is headed by kevin kolman, 33, who has a master's degree in education. he is an affable but no-nonsense instructor who expects his students to study the material and do their best on quizzes. \"they should be able to answer, 'what is the definition of a flavorizer bar?' \" he said, \"or 'what is the importance of a damper system in a charcoal grill?' \" danny rine, a 23-year-old salesman from ace hardware in suburban glenview, ill., was impressed by the fancy weber summit grill center with social area: an l-shaped appliance more than nine feet wide. \"our customers,\" he said, with eyes growing wide, \"are really talking about this thing.\" he said the possibilities were endless. that is what keeps life interesting for people in the hot line center, which fields about 500,000 calls a year and 75,000 e-mails. one worker monitors facebook and twitter for posts about cooking troubles, and connects a weber expert with grillers in distress. most of the time, ms. olsen said, the answer is an easy one. people sometimes simply forget to turn up heat. \"you'll tell the man the answer, and in the background you can hear his wife say, 'see, i told you so.' \" in some cases, there is no quick remedy. some people call to tell ms. olsen they have a houseful of guests, and they have just taken a turkey out of the freezer. \"i'm afraid,\" she tells them, \"you're not going to be eating that turkey today.\" if things go wrong, she encourages people to have some perspective. \"it's not life-saving medicine,\" ms. olsen tells them, \"it's just grilling.\" she does not claim to be much of a cook. she came to weber after her husband died of leukemia. she was working at a drugstore and needed a better job. she sold a lottery ticket to a weber employee, who dropped off a job application. now she is revered for her expertise. charmed by ms. olsen's patience and good humor, more than one gentleman caller has made overtures that go beyond grilling advice or warranty information. one such call turned into a courtship. \"one thing led to another, and i ended up flying out to connecticut to visit him,\" she said. he grilled pita bread and stuffed them with vegetables. \"now that man could cook,\" she said, blushing .",

        "abstract": "seattle with a mere 26 runs batted in entering friday, jason bay and brendan ryan of the seattle mariners had fewer r.b.i. combined than three yankees robinson cano, travis hafner and lyle overbay had individually. they were tied with brett gardner. their feeble batting averages also suggested they would be of little threat to hiroki kuroda, who has been arguably the yankees' best pitcher this season. but kuroda has not been as sharp over the last three weeks as he was early on, and behind bay and ryan of all people, the mariners battered kuroda in the fourth on the way to a 4-1 victory. ryan, the no. 9 hitter, who was batting .217 entering the game, hit a two-out, two-run single in that long inning. two batters later, bay did the same. bay finished 2 for 3 with a walk, raising his batting average 10 points, all the way to .224. the yankees, meanwhile, managed only four hits. the loss ended the yankees' four-game winning streak and extended kuroda's skid. he is 0-3 with a 5.23 earned run average in his last four starts, dating to may 22. of all the games in this series at safeco field, this one seemed the most likely to end in a yankees victory. the mariners' starting pitcher, jeremy bonderman, was making only his second start of the year. in his first, on sunday against the minnesota twins, he had given up seven runs in four and two-thirds innings. bonderman, coming off two years of injuries, had not won a game since sept. 8, 2010, when he was with the detroit tigers. \"it's been a long time,\" he said. \"almost three years of trying to get back and feeling like i could get back on the field and compete again.\" the surging yankees, on the other hand, were looking to kuroda to help them match their longest winning streak of the season, and most of the time this season and last his presence on the mound has led to a yankees win. \"every time he goes out there, we have a chance to win, and that's a good feeling for a club,\" manager joe girardi said before the game. but coming off a 3-0 loss to the boston red sox in a rain-shortened game at yankee stadium on sunday, kuroda allowed four runs in six and one-third innings. all four runs came in the fateful fourth. \"i was not able to locate my slider,\" said kuroda, who also lamented that he was not aggressive enough with some hitters. kuroda gave up a two-out double in the second and third innings but was able to get the third out without any trouble. such good fortune ran out in the fourth. the yankees were ahead, 1-0, when, with two outs, mariners designated hitter michael morse lashed a double over brett gardner's head in center field. nick franklin drew a walk on a full-count pitch, and kuroda then walked kelly shoppach to load the bases. with his pitch count already up, kuroda let a pitch sail over the middle of the plate to ryan, who rapped it into right field. morse and franklin scored to give seattle the lead. but kuroda, who has had success stifling rallies this year, could still not put the mariners away. endy chavez hit a bouncer up the middle. as yankees shortstop reid brignac went to scoop it up a step on second base would have ended the inning the ball hit the bag and bounced away from brignac. all the runners were safe, and the bases were loaded once again, this time for bay. with a double already to his credit, bay made good contact again, ripping a single into left field that scored shoppach and ryan and put the mariners ahead by 4-1. after three awful years with the mets in which he hit .234 with only 26 home runs he had 36 home runs in his last year in boston, 2009 bay signed with the mariners in the off-season and was given a chance to make the team in spring training. despite his poor batting average, bay entered friday's game with 8 home runs and 18 walks, giving him an on-base percentage (.311) nearly 100 points higher than his average and an on-base plus slugging percentage of .725. during the mariners' recent homestand, in which he had 19 at-bats, bay had two hits. he matched that total in his first two at-bats friday, and he also drew a walk in his first plate appearance, in the first inning. inside pitch the yankees drafted michael o'neill, the nephew of paul o'neill and a junior outfielder from the university of michigan, 103rd over all. ... michael pineda is scheduled to make his first minor league rehabilitation start on saturday, and joe girardi said he would like to see pineda throw 90 to 100 pitches at least twice, if not three times, before he was activated. girardi said the yankees still saw pineda, who is recovering from shoulder surgery last year, as a starting pitcher. ... the yankees announced that chien-ming wang exercised the out clause in his minor league contract. the yankees did not have room for wang in their five-man rotation and were concerned about his arm strength.",

        "title": "alex rodriguez is an october surprise.",
        "abstract": "alex rodriguez, the fox pregame-show version of himself, was sitting on a black couch in a trailer outside citi field on friday night talking about the world series. this is a new role for rodriguez, an unexpected diversion in a journey of athletic greatness tainted by performance-enhancing drugs, and one he is excelling at. so he looked happy to be talking about baseball as he peered into his interviewer's eyes, answered some questions, avoided some others and posed a few of his own. he discussed his love of preparation, his note-taking, his working with pete rose (\"when it comes to baseball, he has an ivy league mind\") and his admiration of keith hernandez. rodriguez previewed what he would later say on the air about the physical strength of mets starter noah syndergaard and the possibility that the mets could beat the kansas city royals, who were up by 2-0. if the yankees could sweep the royals in the bronx earlier this season after dropping two of three, he said, the mets could win. this has been a rather remarkable evolution: rodriguez, a noted baseball transgressor, working for one of baseball's network partners, talking to a national audience in the lingua franca of baseball before and after each postseason game. he's probably been more observational than analytic describing, with bat in hand, how the mets' hitting coach, kevin long, has rebuilt daniel murphy's power stroke (before his home run skein ended); how making contact with matt harvey's fastball \"feels like a bowling ball\"; and how syndergaard's bench-pressing power has helped him add torque to his slider. mike weisman, a former top baseball producer at nbc and fox, said that rodriguez had been very effective in the \"protected\" studio setting, where comments can be rehearsed and there are \"all sorts of expertise around him.\" rodriguez was, after all, suspended for the 2014 season after an investigation by major league baseball of the biogenesis scandal concluded that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. he denied those accusations. he fulminated. he sued. then he backed down, ended the spectacle and returned to the yankees. he made a sort-of admission of his sins and played at an unexpectedly high level (33 home runs, 86 runs batted in), given his time off and his age. and over the last two weeks, he has performed so well for fox that it is reasonable to assume that his tv work is an exercise in image rehabilitation. here, then, was someone who instinctively understood how to act in a studio; how to easily engage the people he worked with; and how to analyze baseball succinctly. \"at heart,\" he said, \"i'm a teacher.\" but this is, after all, a-rod, who has a way of evoking suspicion about his actions. you want him to spill the strategy behind gauging fox's interest in him and his assessment that if he excelled at talking knowingly about pitching and hitting, he would be able to extend the era of good feelings he generated by having a surprisingly strong season, performing unusually well and saying nothing that could provoke or upset anyone. that won back some fans and a bit of the heart of yankee management and, perhaps, offered hope that he might be a productive hitter in the final two years of his contract. if that was the plan if there was any television plan at all he was not saying. \"i'm the wrong guy to talk about image,\" he said. he willingly brought up the terrible image choice he made in 2009, when he was asked the other day by jimmy fallon on \"the tonight show\" what the 40-year-old a-rod would say to his younger self. \"if you ever do a photo shoot, don't kiss any mirrors,\" he said, referring to the one he did for details magazine that portrayed him as a narcissist. working for fox was not rodriguez's idea. fox approached him. it was willing to accept his past and move on a decision like the one the network made when it hired the (still) permanently exiled, bow-tied, white-booted pete rose to the show. rose arrived during the season and has played the cranky coot to a-rod's smooth straight man. fox clearly saw the benefits in hiring stars who were making news this season: rose's reinstatement is being considered by commissioner rob manfred, and rodriguez had a very good season. \"we certainly considered the pros and cons of what alex has gone through, but at the end of the day it really wasn't going to be a part of the decision to make him part of the broadcast,\" said john entz, president for production for fox sports. \"whatever he did and went through is in the past. we feel we're trying to make a show that's informational and entertaining, and we feel that we've done that and alex is a huge part of it.\" rodriguez's conversation is filled with expressions of humility about being hired by fox; about his time with rose; about the generally positive reception to his television work; about the difficulty of doing television work. asked about his biggest challenge in working in the los angeles studio or on outside sets at kauffman stadium and citi field, he said, \"i'm a novice, so everything is hard.\" asked if viewers should be surprised that he is showing off the sophistication of his baseball side to an audience that might be more accustomed to bland sound bites, he said, \"yes, because i'm surprised.\" after a pause, he added: \"all kidding aside, i love baseball. i've been watching multiple games on television since i'm 7, 8 or 9. thousands of games.\" asked about the best advice he had received before he started his fox work, he ticked off general praise for the fox game announcers joe buck and harold reynolds; lauded michael kay of the yes network, which televises yankees games; and circled back to buck, who, he said, told him to be himself, to speak to the audience as he had done to buck over the years during private conversations over dinner. he recalled that he was as nervous in his first day in the fox studio as he was when, as an 18-year-old seattle mariner, he faced roger clemens. now, he is less anxious, but he defaulted to self-deprecation when he assessed his performance. \"the luckiest thing,\" he said, \"is the bar is set extremely low.\" you wonder, though, if he can ever fully atone for the actions that have tainted his on-field accomplishments. is seeing him before american league championship series and world series games a constant reminder of what he has lost or an affirmation of the baseball savvy that he is known for but that has often been obscured by the nonsense that has surrounded him? is working with rose as part of an exiled dynamic duo yet another symbol of his sins or a sharp career move with an eye toward his future? why did he accept fox's offer and not slip quietly into off-season workouts? \"i don't know,\" he said. \"look, five years ago, i never would have thought of doing this. i would have been too shy and uncomfortable in front of a camera. you know i'm not the best speaker in front of the camera. it's been a magical season for me. i'm incredibly humbled by the way i was welcomed back by the franchise and the fans, so when i was told fox wanted to talk to me, i said, 'why not?' \" rodriguez did not address whether the studio version of a-rod would change perceptions about him. he is resistant to such proclamations, so he sidestepped the question, offering this: \"one of the things i took real seriously in 2015 was to keep it simple, don't overthink. see ball, hit ball. so when fox called, i was incredibly humbled.\"",

        "title": "merck wins u.s. approval for a new diabetes drug.",
        "abstract": "federal drug regulators yesterday approved a new diabetes medicine from merck that is expected to become a blockbuster treatment used by millions of people worldwide. januvia, the new medicine, is a once-daily pill that has fewer severe side effects than existing diabetes medications and does not cause weight gain, according to clinical trials. the food and drug administration said januvia could be prescribed either on its own or in addition to other medicines. it is aimed at type 2 diabetes, the most common form, which affects nearly 21 million americans 7 percent of the population and more than 200 million people globally. merck said januvia would cost just under $5 a day, or about $145 a month, comparable to existing treatments. merck shares rose slightly after the approval was announced yesterday morning, which had been expected. many doctors say they believe januvia and galvus, a similar drug from novartis that is expected to be approved later this year will be valuable for many patients with diabetes, most of whom have dangerously high levels of blood sugar despite existing treatments. \"i can't wait to put people on the drug,\" dr. james underberg, a clinical assistant professor at new york university medical school who participated in a clinical trial of januvia. januvia is the third major new diabetes drug approved since the summer of 2005, and potentially the most important, analysts and doctors say. the drug works in a different way than existing treatments, and its pill form makes it more convenient than byetta, a treatment approved last year that has some of the same benefits as januvia but must be taken by injection. analysts predict that januvia, either as a stand-alone treatment or in combination with an existing diabetes drug called metformin, will have worldwide sales of nearly $2 billion by 2010. merck hopes to win approval for that combined drug early next year. optimism about januvia has helped push merck shares up 38 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent gain for the average large drug stock. merck shares closed yesterday at $43.96, up 20 cents at their highest level since the company withdrew its arthritis drug vioxx in september 2004 after a study linked vioxx to heart attacks and strokes. executives at merck declined to comment on their plans for advertising januvia to consumers. unlike several other major drug makers, merck has not committed to waiting at least six months before advertising new drugs so that doctors have a chance to learn about new therapies before patients begin asking for them. but physicians like dr. underberg are already enthusiastic. \"it doesn't cause weight gain, it doesn't cause episodes of hypoglycemia, and the side effects otherwise are pretty moderate,\" he said. hypoglycemia is a potentially dangerous condition in which blood sugar levels drop too fast. in severe instances, it can cause fainting or even coma. several older diabetes drugs can cause hypoglycemia by pushing the pancreas to produce large amounts insulin quickly. in contrast, januvia and galvus are the first in a newer class of drugs called dpp-iv inhibitors, which work by enhancing levels of a natural protein called glp-1. the protein stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin and discourages the liver from making glucose. but the dpp-iv inhibitors work only when blood sugar levels are already elevated, such as after a meal, sharply lowering the risk for hypoglycemia. \"the approval of januvia marks an important advance in the fight against diabetes,\" dr. steven galson, director of the f.d.a.'s center for drug evaluation and research, said in a statement. \"we now have another new option that treats the disease in an entirely new way.\" diabetes is a disease in which blood sugar rises uncontrollably from a lack of, or resistance to, insulin, a hormone normally produced in the pancreas. in type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce insulin. type 2 diabetes is linked to obesity and inactivity. typically, the disease progresses over several years as the pancreas gradually loses the ability to produce insulin, and drug treatments lose their effectiveness. eventually, many patients wind up injecting themselves with insulin to control their blood sugar. severe, late-stage diabetes sharply raises the risks of many medical problems, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease and blindness. jay galeota, general manager of merck's global diabetes division, said merck planned to ship januvia to pharmacies and offer samples to doctors' offices quickly. the company expects to market januvia to both doctors and patients almost immediately, he said. \"we're confident that we're going to communicate the science of januvia in a very wide way,\" he said. \"we're expecting very rapid uptake right away.\" while there are several major classes of diabetes medicines already on the market, many have side effects that discourage patients from taking them, including weight gain and nausea. as a result, the market is ripe for new treatments, doctors and analysts say. in clinical trials that examined januvia in 2,719 patients, the most common side effects were sore throat, diarrhea and colds , the f.d.a. said. richard evans, an analyst at sanford c. bernstein & company, said he expected januvia and galvus to rapidly replace an older class of drugs called sulfonylureas. the newer drugs are similarly effective but much less likely to cause weight gain and hypoglycemia, he said. \"everybody knows that sulfonylureas are kind of a losing game,\" he said. while galvus and januvia are very similar, januvia may have an edge because it clearly works as a once-a-day pill, while galvus was initially formulated to be taken twice daily, mr. evans said. novartis, the manufacturer of galvus, now claims that its drug is effective when taken once daily, but doctors may be skeptical of that claim, he said. tony butler, an industry analyst at lehman brothers, said he expected that januvia would have sales of $271 million next year, rising to $1.1 billion by 2010. mr. butler said sales of the januvia-metformin combination pill would be $500 million more in 2010.",

        "title": "for facebook and conservatives, a collegial meeting in silicon valley.",
        "abstract": "menlo park, calif. cordiality reigned and pleasantries were exchanged. there was talk of virtual reality, a tour of frank gehry-designed buildings and only a hint of disagreement. after more than a week of controversy over allegations that facebook displays a liberal media bias , a group of 16 republican pundits and politicians met with the social network's chief, mark zuckerberg, its chief operating officer, sheryl sandberg, and other top executives on wednesday. the tete-a-tete at facebook's headquarters was an attempt by the company to mend fences with conservatives and, by most accounts, it was a step in the right direction. the 90-minute meeting was described as mostly collegial, sympathetic and inquisitive by those in attendance. some of the time was spent airing concerns and grievances quite politely with the group saying they felt conservatives did not have a true voice in the generally liberal area of silicon valley. to reassure attendees that facebook is open to all perspectives, the company walked them through a technical presentation on how it surfaces the most popular news stories on the site. when the group raised the issue of ideological diversity or a lack thereof among employees at facebook, who mostly lean left, there was a pause. attendees struggled to come to an agreement over how to solve the issue. some suggested adding more training and in-depth job interviews, but were rebuffed by those who saw that as not being in line with conservative principles. that was all left behind later, when the republican group including dana perino of fox news and barry bennett, a campaign coordinator for donald j. trump were taken on a tour of facebook's campus, with its frank gehry-designed structures. the attendees were also given a demonstration of facebook's oculus virtual reality technology. \"i would actually commend facebook for being the only one of the major tech groups in silicon valley that's willing to have conversations like this,\" zac moffatt, a co-founder of the political consultancy group targeted victory and a republican digital strategist, said in an interview after the meeting. \"it came about in a challenging way, but i actually think that silicon valley over all, it behooves them to all prepare for this and get ahead and have this type of engagement.\" mr. zuckerberg was similarly effusive when the meeting concluded. \"we've built facebook to be a platform for all ideas,\" he said in a post to his personal facebook page. \"our community's success depends on everyone feeling comfortable sharing anything they want.\" for facebook, the meeting was a crucial attempt to repair its relationship with the right after a story published last week by the news site gizmodo, which claimed that some facebook staff members regularly suppressed conservative news stories on a section of the social networking site known as trending. facebook disputed the allegations and later published its internal editorial guidelines to show how it surfaces popular stories, but that did little to quell a backlash from conservatives against the company. mr. zuckerberg himself has fostered the perception that facebook leans liberal with his public comments about supporting citizenship for children of illegal immigrants and marriage equality rights. the social network can ill afford to look like it only supports one side, however. in the last year it has stepped up its efforts to be a major force for democrats and republicans in this year's presidential election. the company has long planned to sponsor both this summer's republican and democratic national conventions, and has worked with outlets like fox news on the republican debates. alienating a particular political party or its constituents could potentially hurt facebook's popularity over time with users and, perhaps more important, with advertisers and potential partners. \"it doesn't make sense for our mission or our business to suppress political content or prevent anyone from seeing what matters most to them,\" mr. zuckerberg said in his facebook post on wednesday. at the meeting, which was organized by joel kaplan , facebook's vice president for global public policy and the company's highest-ranking republican, most of the conversation focused on opening and continuing a dialogue between facebook and conservatives. fruit, cheese, water and coffee were served. peter thiel, a facebook board member who is also a delegate for mr. trump, was also in attendance. during the discussion, the group agreed that there should be no government regulation in the process. facebook executives used the point to bring up an inquiry sent to them last week by senator john thune, republican of south dakota. mr. thune has asked the company to explain its filtering practices and whether its news curators manipulated the content. facebook officials said they were looking forward to answering his questions in writing and would be responding. many conservatives left the meeting encouraged, but also with a wait-and-see approach. \"we'll see if the dialogue continues and if they work to really make improvements and to see how they can prevent these things from happening in the future,\" said jenny beth martin, the co-founder of the tea party patriots. \"they sincerely seem to acknowledge that they have areas that they have to improve and they want to learn from those mistakes and be better in the future.\" arthur c. brooks of the american enterprise institute, a conservative think tank, said he told facebook \"they need to think about more diversity of ideas, of religious groups and not be a monoculture and they understood this and were very sympathetic to this.\" at least one republican who attended will not be leaving facebook: rob bluey, editor in chief of the daily signal, said in an interview with fox news that he would not be changing how his website, which is part of the heritage foundation, a conservative organization, uses facebook as a platform. \"as it stands, facebook reaches over a billion people,\" mr. bluey said. \"there's a lot of conservatives who use it.\"",

        "abstract": "two out-of-the-ordinary events happened on saturday, oct. 29, at chelsea market. one was the snowstorm outside. the other: a raucous cycling party inside. all shoppers had to do was follow the thumping girl-power music of pink's \"raise your glass\" or the gleeful \"whew!\" yelled out every minute or so, and they would have arrived at the hot spot, in an empty store across from posman books and l'arte del gelato. indeed, as the class climbed its aerobic crescendo, dozens of passers-by dropped their shopping bags outside the windows of the store to gawk at this makeshift spin studio. inside, sparkling chains of aluminum curtains surrounded 40 stationary bikes, all occupied by sweating, whooping, weekend warriors. a d.j. was grooving behind a turntable, while lacey stone, a charismatic blond instructor, intermittently barked out instructions and belted lyrics. meet the pop-up workout, a sort of fitness flash mob. this one was organized by kiwisweat , a new company that conducts its business online and its workouts in brick-and-mortar spaces that have a modern, decidedly ungymlike feel. \"i've always been attracted to the pop-ups,\" said pam graf, co-founder of kiwisweat, who said she had eaten in pop-up restaurants and browsed at pop-up sales. \"they're a moment in time, and they're gone.\" ms. graf and her business partner, alicia thomas, had wanted to open a spin studio in upper manhattan. when issues with their landlord developed, they started to look at alternative spaces, and the pop-up concept dawned on them. \"we thought, what if we used available retail spaces temporarily for a while?\" ms. thomas said. \"but then we thought, wait a minute, what about using really crazy spaces instead?\" and so this year they began researching locations. ms. graf said they wanted the spaces to serve as \"characters in the story\" of the workout. the women booked two weeks in october at chelsea market, then transported their studio to a raw space in dumbo, brooklyn, for four days. for several days in mid-november, they booked the invisible dog art center in cobble hill, brooklyn. other sites they're considering include grand central terminal , the lightship frying pan (a boat on the hudson) and dekalb market in downtown brooklyn. although spinning is currently the focus, ms. graf and ms. thomas are interested in organizing other motivational workouts, like urban rebounding and yoga . a case in point: starting on jan. 21, kickboxing classes will be held onstage on the set of \"the history of the world,\" a play at the living theater on the lower east side. \"we're trying to transform the mundane piece of exercising out of the normal gym workout,\" ms. thomas said. inga burekhovich, a manhattan lawyer, seemed hooked. \"this is my third class this week,\" she said at the chelsea market event. \"i like a good mix; i get bored easily.\" she added that she appreciated the personal touch of the kiwisweat experience, including mini-chalkboards on bikes with the names of the riders, so the instructor could single out participants, and individualized cubbies with locks. amy harloff, a financial services consultant also from manhattan, mentioned another perk to the roving workout: seeing new parts of the city. \"i've lived here for 17 years, and i've never visited chelsea market before,\" she said. consider it visited.",

        "abstract": "east rutherford, n.j. the giants were a squabbling, hobbling team when they left pittsburgh in defeat sunday night. during their first day back at work in new jersey on tuesday, a tiff involving victor cruz was resolved, but defensive players spoke as if the injured defensive end jason pierre-paul was already ruled out of the team's next game, against the dallas cowboys. \"his presence is going to be missed,\" linebacker jonathan casillas said of pierre-paul, who missed most of the pittsburgh game after injuring his groin in the second quarter. using pierre-paul's nickname, casillas added, \"we have guys who are going to step up, but no one is j.p.p.\" the giants issued no medical update on pierre-paul, who walked through the locker room tuesday without a limp but declined to talk to reporters. losing their best defender against the cowboys, who have the n.f.l.'s best record, would be a serious setback, especially since pierre-paul has had some of his most dominating games against the cowboys. \"interceptions, sacks he's done it all against dallas,\" casillas said. \"tony romo probably had nightmares about him for years.\" in pierre-paul's absence, defensive ends kerry wynn and romeo okwara would most likely see more playing time. there is a possibility that pierre-paul will miss multiple weeks. he crumpled to the turf while rushing steelers quarterback ben roethlisberger on sunday. in 12 games this season, pierre-paul has seven sacks and 53 tackles and has forced three fumbles. he took one of those fumbles into the end zone for a touchdown. cruz, who was upset that he did not have a pass thrown his way in pittsburgh, seemed placated by a meeting tuesday with coach ben mcadoo. \"it was a conversation that needed to be had, and we turned the page and moved on,\" cruz said. \"it was not contentious just two guys trying to problem-solve. i saw opportunities last week when i could have gotten the football, but sometimes the defense dictates where the ball is going.\" cruz has only 27 receptions this season, but his average gain per catch (17.1 yards) leads the team. he had the game-winning touchdown catch in the giants' season-opening victory over dallas on sept. 11. \"my only quarrel,\" cruz said, \"was that i'm trying to compete at the highest level and be a catalyst for helping my team win. i think there will be a concerted effort to get everyone the ball, myself included. i feel like i'll be getting at least one target this week.\"",

        "title": "as antics subside, both cuomo and the left claim the last hurrah.",
        "abstract": "colonie, n.y. weeks of intense negotiations between gov. andrew m. cuomo and an impatient, insurgent left resolved themselves shortly before midnight on saturday in a stormy night of brinkmanship and shuttle diplomacy. in the end, liberals were exulting in what they believed would be the start of a tectonic shift in new york politics, as the governor agreed to abandon his republican allies in the state senate and throw his weight behind electing fellow democrats. in turn, the working families party agreed to support mr. cuomo. \"i believe the world starts to turn now,\" mayor bill de blasio of new york city told a rollicking crowd at the convention of the working families party, a group of liberal activists and labor unions that had been divided over whether to support the governor's re-election. but if saturday's madcap machinations in this albany suburb are the shape of things to come, the liberal-democratic rapprochement could make politics as usual in albany look serene and orderly by comparison. a week after a highly choreographed convention held by democrats, where mr. cuomo was the lustrous star, the governor was mocked, booed and ridiculed. some attendees at the convention taped orange sheets of paper to their shirts that stated their view of mr. cuomo's promises in bold capital letters: \"i am a non believer.\" in smaller type, the signs asked: \"do you believe?\" mr. cuomo, who is careful to appear in front of only enthusiastic crowds, steered clear of the hostile reception at the convention, held at the desmond hotel near albany. he kept his distance by relaying his promises in a recorded video which itself became the subject of intense negotiations and then even addressing the convention in a decidedly low-tech method: by calling the iphone of a working families staff member, which was hooked up to the sound system in the ballroom where the convention was being held. image mayor bill de blasio of new york spoke in person. credit nathaniel brooks for the new york times the boisterous scene, abetted by a cash bar outside the convention hall that did a brisk business, was the culmination of weeks of tense discussions between mr. cuomo and the leadership of working families. mr. de blasio served as a key mediator, even squeezing in a pair of conference calls on friday before he was due in times square to see the broadway revival of \"a raisin in the sun.\" (after the curtain call, the mayor texted aides to check in on any developments.) the vote by working families to support mr. cuomo, which spared him from an embarrassing rebuke, ended what amounted to a high-stakes political standoff among new york's most impassioned liberals and a governor many of them do not trust. the party reached new heights with mr. de blasio's election, but faced the prospect of a civil war over its handling of mr. cuomo's re-election bid, with union leaders pushing for the party to stick with mr. cuomo and rank-and-file activists resisting the idea. george gresham, the president of the 1199 s.e.i.u united healthcare workers east, made his case by quoting a kenny rogers song. \"you need to know when to hold 'em,\" mr. gresham said. \"with this victory, you know when to fold 'em.\" until moments before mr. cuomo addressed the convention via video, however, it seemed possible that the peace agreement would unravel. in the hours leading up to the vote, liberal activists fed up with mr. cuomo buttonholed party members and urged them to support a challenger, zephyr teachout, a fordham law professor. they commandeered the hotel's billiards room, covering the two pool tables with poster board and sharpie markers to be used for making anti-cuomo signs. susan weber, a state committee member from the albany suburbs, made a poster labeling the governor \"cuomoccio,\" complete with an outline of his head showing a pinocchio-like nose. \"if we endorse him, we run the risk of losing our base,\" she said. \"if we don't support him, he will do his best to kill us.\" next to the billiards room, the leaders of the working families party set up a war room in the hotel's \"international business center,\" where a flat screen monitor listed flight arrivals at the albany airport. image a poster opposed endorsing the governor. credit nathaniel brooks for the new york times emma wolfe, one of mr. de blasio's most trusted aides, popped in and out of the room throughout the afternoon, bouncing around the hotel's inner courtyards. at one point, she intercepted dorothy siegel, an activist from cobble hill, brooklyn, and the treasurer of working families, as she headed into the billiards room to huddle with the budding insurgency. \"look me in the eye,\" ms. wolfe pleaded, invoking the mayor. ms. siegel, who had planned to vote for ms. teachout, ultimately decided to abstain. \"i'm a very pragmatic person,\" she said. \"it's not about andrew cuomo. i'm glad he saw the progressive light, and now we'll get a progressive senate.\" by late afternoon, as it became clear that the terms of a rapprochement had been nailed down, working families staff members began emailing members of mr. cuomo's staff to hammer out exactly how the governor would address the party faithful, according to emails reviewed by the new york times. there was talk of creating a live feed, so the governor could speak to delegates in real time. it was decided instead mr. cuomo would appear in a recorded video, one that needed to be vetted by top working families leaders. mr. de blasio arrived at the hotel on saturday evening and hunkered down in \"the lodge,\" a meeting room next to the hotel's indoor swimming pool with stuffed animal heads on the wall. clutching his cellphone, he paced back and forth below a moose head, and conferred with ms. wolfe. both were fielding calls from the governor and his advisers. the scene at the convention was chaotic. leaders of the party were still figuring out the order of speakers less than an hour before the program was to start. and the confusion threatened to trickle into the sensitive political pageantry of the night. mr. cuomo's campaign staff sent a script to working families. it fell short of what he had previously promised, but just how short was a matter of interpretation. people within the party said that mr. cuomo had failed to address a handful of key issues important to them. an emissary for mr. cuomo said it was just a matter of fine tuning the language. soon after, working families announced that the convention would take a 10-minute intermission, citing \"technical difficulties.\" when the video was played, the governor looked like he was being held for ransom. leaders of working families insisted he speak to the convention live, to elaborate on certain of his promises. even that was not enough; following his live call to address the convention, mr. cuomo spoke with a smaller group of party members to expand yet again on his commitments. on sunday, in manhattan, mr. cuomo had a much tidier account of the drama. \"look, it's very simple at these political conventions,\" he said. \"you either win or you lose, and i won.\"",

        "title": "china names 14 generals suspected of corruption.",
        "abstract": "beijing china 's military authority on monday released a list of 14 generals who are under investigation or have been convicted of graft, among them the son of one of china's once highest-ranking generals. the generals were the latest prominent officers to fall under president xi jinping 's sweeping anticorruption campaign. published on the official website of the people's liberation army three days before china's rubber-stamp legislature convenes for its annual meeting in beijing, the list identifies a host of leading officers, the majority of whom are in the political and logistics departments of the military, navy, missile corps and other branches. the investigators' focus on the military bureaucracy highlights two distinct types of corruption that the communist party believes undermine military readiness, experts say: bribery in political departments relating to the sale of positions; and embezzlement within logistics departments, which handle large amounts of money as well as contracts. among those being investigated is maj. gen. guo zhenggang, the son of guo boxiong, the retired vice chairman of the powerful central military commission, which oversees the 2.3 million members of china's armed forces, the world's largest. general guo, 45, the deputy political commissar of military command in the coastal province of zhejiang, was put under investigation last month, suspected of \"serious legal violations and criminal offenses,\" a common official euphemism for corruption. in what appeared to be a well-timed media campaign coordinated to discredit the general, the investigative magazine caijing published a long expose of his family's corrupt land dealings online, 10 minutes after the list of generals was released. according to the article, general guo's wife and mother-in-law were sued by investors after their real estate company took in over 500 million renminbi, more than $80 million, to build a five-story hardware market that was never completed. speculation that members of the guo family were being investigated on corruption charges has swirled for months, despite the government's attempts to keep their names off social media. last year, the elder mr. guo, once the military's top uniformed officer, was rumored to have tried to flee the country dressed in women's clothing. although there was no proof verifying the rumor, censors quickly blocked search terms like \"guo + dress in drag\" on the popular microblog platform sina weibo, according to china digital times, a website based in berkeley, calif., that covers china news and digital media. mr. guo has not officially been accused of corruption. the military notice also announced that lan weijie, a former deputy commander in the central province of hubei, was sentenced to life in prison in january for accepting bribes, owning property purchased with \"unidentified sources\" and the illegal possession of firearms. last year, china's widening military corruption scandal ensnared the military's former no. 2 official, xu caihou, who was indicted in october on bribery charges. mr. xu is one of the highest-ranking targets of the anticorruption campaign begun by president xi, who is also head of the central military commission. mr. xi has vowed to clean up the military as part of his campaign to strengthen party rule by reining in corruption. the campaign comes as china is upgrading its military capabilities to bolster claims over disputed maritime territories in the south and east china seas, with an eye on countering the influence of the united states in asia and the pacific. on monday, the people's liberation army published a separate commentary on its website lauding the investigations as proof that the military was serious about fighting corruption. \"they show the military's courage to cut the poison off the bones with a knife and make steel out of raging fire,\" it said, adding, \"let us praise the people's army that is truly worthy of the people's trust.\" but the military's anticorruption drive also appears intended to fortify mr. xi's hold on power by targeting rival factions and alerting members of his own about the limits of corruption he will tolerate, according to phillip c. saunders, director of the center for the study of chinese military affairs at the national defense university in washington. so far, investigators have only investigated former senior members of the central military commission, rather than those appointed by mr. xi. \"it seems to be strategic in who they're going after and not going after,\" mr. saunders said. \"there are people being made an example of within the p.l.a., but it's not the people at the very top. this achieves the purpose of warning them to tone down corruption without the political cost.\"",

        "title": "r. donahue peebles on letting employees change lanes.",
        "abstract": "this interview with r. donahue peebles of the peebles corporation was conducted and condensed by adam bryant. q. what were some early influences for you? a. my parents divorced when i was 5, and i lived with my mother. she was a working single parent, and i learned to be a bit more independent. by the time i was 8, i would often cook for myself and take care of myself. my mother worked really hard, so i didn't want to burden her with me. as a teenager, i played a lot of sports and tended to lead the teams. but my mother felt i needed a little more discipline, so she thought i should be a page on capitol hill. she had worked at the urban league years earlier, and one of the congressmen she knew was john conyers. he helped me get me a position as a page on the hill. i was 16. instead of attending high school near my home, i went to the u.s. capitol page school from 6 to 10:30 in the morning on the top floor of the library of congress. from 10:30 on, i worked in the house of representatives. after working all day, i would go home and then have basketball practice until about 9 p.m. then i would do my homework, go to bed around midnight, and then get up at 4 the next morning to do it all over again. i learned to budget my time very efficiently, and i would catch up on sleep on the weekends. then my mother had a prolonged illness and could not really work for about a year and a half. but with my job as a page, and work i did in representative conyers's office, i was able to help support our household. i made some tremendous relationships over the years. my graduation ceremony was in the cannon caucus room on capitol hill; president carter gave me a certificate of achievement earlier in the day. i spent a lot of my childhood watching others lead and learning how to lead. did you have specific career plans when you went to college? i was going to study medicine at rutgers. one of the frustrating or difficult things for me as a child was the instability. i planned on having a family at some point, and i wanted to be able to take care of them and give them opportunity and stability. so i figured i would be a doctor because i had a good aptitude for sciences. but after the first year, i decided i wasn't going to go into medicine, and i went back to d.c. my mother had a real estate appraisal business, and so i worked for her. by the time i was 23, i was the youngest person appointed to the property tax appeal board in the district. the next year, i was named chair of the board, one of the most powerful positions in washington's real estate industry. what leadership lessons had prepared you for that? i learned from watching my mother, and i learned from watching politics. it's about getting people vested in the outcome of success. i also knew i didn't need to take credit for everything. i was the chairman, so if the board did well, i was going to get credit for it. but i felt it was important to let other people get credit and recognition, and it gave them more of a sense of ownership in the goal. now you're in real estate development. how big is your company? we have about $3.5 billion of projects in development. our executive staff is about two dozen people, and we have fewer than 100 over all. what other insights about leadership have you learned? one is that our company should be a vehicle for our employees to accomplish some of their personal goals. it is a two-way street, but we should give people the opportunity to evolve and learn and grow and not put them in slots or force people to stay in their own lanes. people need to focus on their primary responsibilities, but i want to foster an approach where they can broaden their skill set. i also, for many years, thought the best reward i could give to anyone working in our company was money, whether it was a bonus or a promotion. but i've learned that encouragement and acknowledgment are sometimes more important than dollars. another thing is that i give a lot of autonomy. i've always considered that a good thing being a hands-off person, and giving people a lot of responsibility and leeway. but one of the things i've learned is that people also want more direction because they want to learn. so i've become more engaged in specific areas to be more of a teacher. how do you hire? i want to know the candidates' personal goals and how they think our company can help them achieve those goals. and then to see if there's a good fit, i'll tell them a bit about our company's goals and then ask them how they can help our company achieve those goals while accomplishing their own goals. and then i'll ask them what are the three things they do best and why, and what are the three things they feel they need to improve on and why. but i'll also talk to them for the first 20 minutes about their life where they grew up, what their parents do, and what their goals were when they were growing up. and i'll ask them if they are happy with their choices. do people ever say no? most people will say that they are happy with their choices, but some will say they're looking for more opportunity. what i've generally found is that people do not feel they have the opportunity to grow they're stuck in their lane and they have a greater interest in doing other things.",

        "abstract": "the yankees ' final batting practice session of the morning friday had just ended, sending pitchers and catchers, coaches and club officials into the dugout to get ready for the day's light workout in tampa, fla. two people lingered on the grass, about halfway up the first-base line: catcher francisco cervelli and yogi berra . berra talked. cervelli listened, nodding. their chat lasted only a few minutes, and toward the end, berra settled into a crouch, or as much of a crouch as his 85-year-old legs allow. asked about their conversation, cervelli beamed. \"he said, 'you look much better, more quiet behind the plate, less movement,' \" cervelli said. \"i like when those kind of guys talk to you. they know what they're doing.\" berra is a fixture at yankees spring training. in the mornings, he usually focuses on one field, and there he watches whatever drills are going on: batting practice, infield pop-up work, cut-off plays. on thursday, he pulled nick swisher aside for a brief chat in a dugout on a back field. on friday, he stopped cervelli to offer some advice: to set up his target, his glove, a little earlier. \"that's going to cut my movement,\" cervelli said. \"i've got a lot of energy. so i have to save that energy and get a little quieter behind the plate. if i can get better, i want to make those adjustments. \"he knows what he's talking about. he said, 'every time i watch you, i like what i see.' he's the man, bro.\" beltre out the texas rangers' new regular third baseman, adrian beltre, will miss at least a week of spring games because of a right calf strain. the rangers want to be cautious with beltre, their key off-season acquisition, after a magnetic resonance imaging exam showed an overstretching muscle but no tear. beltre had not had previous problems with his calf. \"i think we're handling this in a very responsible and conservative matter considering where we are in the spring and the nature of who the player is,\" said thad levine, the rangers' assistant general manager. levine said beltre would not play in a game for at least 10 to 14 days, although he is expected to be ready for the regular-season opener april 1 against boston. the rangers' spring training opener is sunday. \"it's better to happen now than the season,\" beltre said. \"now is enough time to get healthy 100 percent.\" beltre agreed to a five-year, $80 million contract last month that includes a vesting option for a sixth year and another $16 million. that free-agent signing prompted the rangers to make the six-time all-star michael young, who played third base the last two seasons, their primary designated hitter and utility infielder. young was away from camp for the second day on friday tending to a personal family matter, but he is expected back saturday.

        "abstract": "bangkok fighting in myanmar between an armed ethnic rebel group and the country's military threatened to spill into chinese territory on monday, the insurgents said, with reports that shelling had killed three people in the border town of laiza . myanmar's military in recent weeks has been pushing toward laiza, the headquarters of the kachin independence army, a rebel group seeking a degree of autonomy from the central government. awng jet, an officer with the kachin independence army, said by telephone the shelling happened early monday and killed three civilians, including a christian missionary and a student. other rebel sources circulated pictures of three bloodied bodies. ye htut, a deputy information minister for the government, expressed skepticism about the attack on his facebook page and said it needed to be \"confirmed independently.\" fighting between the kachin rebels and government troops has sharply escalated since myanmar recently admitted using aircraft to fight the rebels. government troops have appeared to take at least one hilltop position previously held by the rebels, putting them one step closer to laiza, which appeared to be the goal of their intensified campaign. the breakdown of a longstanding cease-fire between the rebels and the military has been a major setback for the government of president thein sein, who is trying to guide myanmar toward democracy after decades of military rule. the cease-fire, which had lasted 17 years, collapsed in june 2011, three months after mr. thein sein came to power. the army's decision to pursue the kachin rebels is risky in part because of the fighting's proximity to china, which is acutely sensitive to any border problems. the decision also contradicts repeated statements by mr. thein sein that the government is seeking peace with the rebels, as it has with other ethnic groups. china sent an unspecified number of troops to the border last week to survey what the chinese state news media called an \"unstable area.\" a photographer in the area on monday said that about 200 members of the chinese security forces had arrived at the border. the fighting is taking place in the low-lying, jungle-clad mountains, the ancestral homeland of the kachin and a terrain that they navigate comfortably. myanmar's army, although it fought battles in that part of the country in the decades after independence, does not know the area as well. some analysts believe this is why the military has resorted to using aircraft. a helicopter used in the campaign crashed on friday, killing the two pilots and an officer onboard. kachin rebels said they had shot down the helicopter , but the government blamed engine failure. the chinese military and officials in yunnan, the southern chinese province that borders myanmar, have been closely observing the deteriorating situation along the border, according to the chinese state news media. global times, a state-run newspaper, reported on friday that shang haifeng, the deputy communist party chief of nabang, a township by the border, said the yunnan military command had established an office in nabang. changjiang daily, a newspaper in the chinese city of wuhan, reported on friday that the conflict was intensifying and that projectiles had exploded on wednesday and thursday afternoons in nabang, which sits across from laiza. the report said that chinese civilians had been evacuated to a nearby location. china's handling of the situation is made more complex because ethnic kachin live on both sides of the border. in recent days, thousands of kachin (who are called jingpo in mandarin) living in nabang gathered at a border checkpoint to protest the attacks by myanmar's army, said ryan roco, a photographer who was working in the laiza area. about 2,000 kachin also gathered on the myanmar side of the border to show solidarity with the chinese protesters, he said. mr. roco said monday in an e-mail that about 200 chinese security personnel had arrived at the border between laiza and nabang. reports from kachin areas suggest that the fighting is hardening the attitudes of kachin civilians against the central government, which is overwhelmingly made up of the majority ethnic burmese. the anger and hatred expressed by many kachin is deflating hopes for a reconciliation. moon nay li, a coordinator of the kachin women's association thailand, an advocacy group, said she sensed \"much less trust toward the government\" since the army began pursuing the kachin rebels. \"how can we believe in the peace process and democracy in burma?\" she said. the kachin are also directing their anger toward daw aung san suu kyi, the former dissident who is now the opposition leader in parliament. ms. moon nay li was among the signers of an open letter sent last year by 23 kachin expatriate organizations to ms. aung san suu kyi, who is ethnically burmese and who has said little about the conflict. in a follow-up to the letter sent last week, the kachin groups lamented the \"confusion and distrust that is being created by your failure to comment in depth on these matters.\"",

        "title": "mark sanchez and jets top rams, ending a three-game skid.",
        "abstract": "st. louis every defeat for the jets has accelerated a potential overhaul, increased the discomfort, intensified the scrutiny. their owner, woody johnson, called this season a \"miserable experience,\" adding that he did not \"sign up\" for such gloom. he put on notice the coach, rex ryan , who vowed to reverse the team's fortunes or \"die trying,\" and the general manager, mike tannenbaum, who in a radio interview insisted that the jets had been making \"meaningful progress.\" six weeks from now, their 27-13 victory sunday against the st. louis rams may be viewed as an aberration, a brief hiatus from the malaise. but for the moment and only a moment, with a date against the a.f.c. east-leading new england patriots looming thursday night at metlife stadium it serves as a welcome break from the anguish, from the controversy, from the uncertainty. the jets' season will continue, with a purpose, because they pummeled a team that resembled their own during their three-game losing streak: disjointed, overwhelmed, uninspired. the jets (4-6) forced three turnovers while committing none. they ran 41 times, alleviating the pressure on mark sanchez . they scored 27 consecutive points, avoiding the indignity of losing to their former offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer, whose unit scored on its opening drive but not again until the game's waning moments. \"it seems that in some of our toughest times, we end up playing some of our best football,\" sanchez said. \"it's a fast way to lose your hair and turn your hair gray, but whatever it takes to win. we have to get wins.\" sanchez still had a full head of dark hair when he stepped behind the lectern late sunday afternoon, about 30 minutes after he darted through a corridor of the edward jones dome and into the jets' locker room, still in full uniform, still carrying a football, still savoring the team's first victory since oct. 14 against indianapolis. after two weeks of wretched play, of red-zone turnovers and faulty decisions and ugly throws, sanchez deserved a game ball sunday. after a week of bedlam and commotion of unattributed criticism of tim tebow in the daily news that ostensibly was intended to silence the clamor for a quarterback switch sanchez validated ryan's faith in him. an offense that produced 9 points in its previous two games tripled that total sunday, with sanchez completing 15 of 20 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown. a few plays away: this has been the jets' motto, it seems, as if a completion here, a missed tackle there could explain a margin of defeat that averaged 17 points. but on sunday, the jets made many of those key plays. \"i think we finally see a bit of light,\" receiver chaz schilens said. in that sense, facing st. louis at this juncture of the schedule was a break for the jets. the rams have not forced a turnover since week 5, but in the first half, they sacked sanchez three times, blocked a field goal, snuffed a fake punt and stampeded 86 yards for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal on their opening drive. and still the jets played far better. sam bradford, the rams' quarterback, lost a fumble, threw an interception deep in st. louis territory and watched as a holding penalty negated what would have been a go-ahead 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by chris givens just before halftime. call it a revival by the jets' defense, which minimized another round of special-teams failures. after janoris jenkins zipped around the left edge to deflect nick folk's 26-yard field-goal attempt in the second quarter, the jets forced a punt. after james laurinaitis stuffed a shovel pass to lex hilliard on a fake punt, the jets forced a turnover. muhammad wilkerson stripped the ball from bradford, and bart scott scooped it up, rumbling 38 yards to the rams' 28. two plays later, sanchez froze the rams' secondary by feinting with his right shoulder one of his best moves and connected with schilens by the front pylon of the end zone, the jets' first offensive touchdown in 17 possessions. \"we need to get more,\" schilens said. so they did. they led by 13-7 at halftime, and after three quarters. but two plays into the fourth, bilal powell slithered in from 5 yards out, and then he later ran in from the 11 both on gutsy calls by the offensive coordinator tony sparano on third down, in typical passing situations. it was 27-7, and the jets' sideline, weary for so long, rejoiced. \"we weren't going to back down,\" defensive end mike devito said. \"we weren't going to fold. we weren't throwing the white flag.\" all week, the jets professed that they were not distracted by the latest installment of that mini-series chaos in florham park. it produced the opposite effect, they said: it galvanized them against outside forces. scott's interpretation of the situation created some uncomfortable moments in the locker room, as he kept telling reporters: \"both teams played hard. that's all you're getting.\" as teammates granted interviews, scott said that players were \"compromised\" for not joining in his media boycott. the tension dissolved, but the mood did not lighten. \"it's only one game,\" cornerback antonio cromartie said. but instead of spiraling deeper into this vortex of despair, a predicament so alarming to johnson that he summoned tannenbaum, ryan and the coordinators for a meeting on tuesday, the jets have meaning again. what they do not have is a winning record. then again, aside from new england, neither does any of their remaining opponents: arizona, jacksonville, tennessee, san diego and buffalo. the jets cling to the notion that they have a chance, much as they did three years ago, when they were 4-6 but sneaked into the playoffs. the challenge now, as it was then, is dispelling the notion that in the end, sunday's victory merely extended the illusion that their season can be saved. said guard brandon moore, \"we move on.\"",

        "abstract": "lexington, ky. back and forth they went, butler and marquette, their game less a basketball matchup, more a war of attrition coming down to the final possession, the final moment, because it had to. every made shot, every rebound, every defensive stop was met in kind. that is how the second half unspooled saturday night, and for marquette, which ultimately escaped with a 74-72 victory, that is how its season, its month, its stay at rupp arena have unfolded as well. the golden eagles won their two games here by a total of 3 points, because of two last-second shots one made, by vander blue on thursday, another missed, by butler center andrew smith, who stumbled before unleashing an off-balance 3-point attempt that smacked off the backboard. \"that's just another marquette game,\" coach buzz williams said. \"we're not good enough to blow anybody out; we're just good enough to get blown out, and if we can turn it into a fight and make it ugly, then it probably trends toward helping us the most.\" as recruiting pitches go, that assessment by williams is not a particularly persuasive one. but the team's resume is. for the third consecutive season, marquette (25-8) moves on to the round of 16, where the golden eagles, seeded no. 3 in the east region, will play the winner of sunday's game between miami and illinois on thursday in washington. \"every game that we play in, it's going to be a grind-out, hard boxing match,\" guard junior cadougan said. marquette's fortitude trickles down from its high-energy coach, williams or perhaps, rather, his wife, corey, who has spent a few days in a local hospital. \"she's tougher than all of us,\" williams said. bullied in their meeting with butler in november, marquette pushed around the bulldogs, and the golden eagles' big man, davante gardner, grabbed four offensive rebounds. men's n.c.a.a. tournament: march 23 13 photos view slide show \" image jonathan daniel/getty images even as the golden eagles played with energy and momentum, they knew that butler (27-9) can be lethal late in games, especially in the national spotlight. butler's marvelous march stampedes are so entrenched in n.c.a.a. tournament lore that its teams can seem indistinguishable from one another, as if the same group of bulldogs emerges from hibernation every march to lay waste to the brackets. of course, that is not true. for one thing, butler did not even receive a bid last year. for another, five of its top seven players including three starters made their tournament debuts the other day. this team edged two no. 1 seeds, indiana and gonzaga, in close games, and coach brad stevens said it inherited the intestinal fortitude of its predecessors. \"we're going to go back and wish we could have controlled a few things a little bit better, but you do that with any loss,\" stevens said. \"and you know, we talk about all the close wins over those runs and certainly the close wins this year, and ironically the only commercial i ever see is a close loss, butler versus duke.\" blue paced marquette with 29 points. clarke, who had 18 points in the first half, led butler with 24. what propelled the golden eagles' second-half surge was intense defensive pressure \"playing man to man as hard as you can play for 94 feet,\" cadougan said that forced 10 turnovers, disrupted the butler offense and, from blue's perspective, left rotnei clarke, the butler sharpshooter, \"a little winded.\" it was blue who put marquette ahead for the first time in the second half, on a dunk with about seven minutes left, and his 3-pointer from the corner evened the score, 69-69, with 1 minute 29 seconds remaining. the golden eagles took the lead for good on two free throws by jamil wilson with 47.7 seconds left, and they led, 74-70, before butler nearly upstaged them. after a goaltending call awarded butler a basket with 3.2 seconds left, blue threw away the inbounds pass, giving the bulldogs the ball back with 2.4 seconds left, needing 2 to tie and a 3-pointer to win. at the top of the key, smith dribbled once and flung a one-hander that was off-line from the start. he wobbled to the other side of the court and crouched over as marquette celebrated. that marquette would be advancing was in doubt at halftime, when they trailed by 35-27, unable to contain clarke, who scored 18 of his team-high 24 points. clarke assumes an important role in marquette's season, his 3-pointer as time expired sending butler to victory back in the maui invitational in november. players divined motivation from that moment, bristling every time it was shown on espn commercials. but what stuck with williams for the reprise were two things: how butler's frontcourt \"abused us,\" and how much better they would need to defend clarke. marquette adjusted, and it will live another week. next season, these two teams will be in the reconstituted big east. if this game was a preview of what could be a fierce rivalry, the programs will be better for it. but for now, marquette owns the bragging rights, and in march that is all that matters.",

ollie officially has played for 11 franchises, but oklahoma city and seattle (where ollie played in 2003) count as one because the sonics moved and became the thunder in 2008. there is no extra credit for playing for two franchises more than once, either. given that n.b.a. players are signed, dropped and traded more than ever, it is quite possible that ollie has had more teammates than any other player in history. \"one door closes and another opens,\" ollie said. \"and if it's not a door, it's a window that's going to be open. i'm going to find my way back into the house again. you better believe that.\" but ollie is not sure whose house he will live in next season. maybe his own, with his family in connecticut. he was signed last year to become the thunder's backup point guard, mentoring the second-year starter russell westbrook. the thunder saw ollie as a steady ball handler, a strong defender and a do-as-he-does example of effort and professionalism for one of the league's young, rising teams. ollie averaged nearly 15 minutes a game through the season's first month. but a knee injury required surgery, and by the time ollie returned two months later, his role had largely been filled by the rookie eric maynor, obtained in a december trade with utah. his mentoring came from the bench, the practice court, the locker room. through monday night's game against the blazers, ollie had played one minute in the previous six games, and he was uncertain whether he would be part of the thunder's playoff roster. but ollie and this helps explain his longevity shrugged such worry away. \"it's been fantastic being around the kids and understanding who they are as people and who we are as a whole,\" ollie said. \"it's been a great, great year for me, on and off the basketball court.\" he learned early that the ups and downs can come unexpectedly. ollie was a steady college point guard for connecticut. he was not drafted in 1995, and spent a couple of seasons in the minor leagues. he made the mavericks in 1997 and was able to live with his father in dallas. \"a dream come true,\" ollie said. he was cut a week before christmas. \"it was a devastating time,\" ollie said. he has lived such swings nearly a dozen times since a career of catch and release, divided by summers of wonder. he has been paid millions of dollars along the way, including about $1.3 million this season, and he has created plenty of personal highlights, including a spin move and a floater over michael jordan (\"i can always pull that tape out if my kids don't believe i played in the league,\" ollie said). he also got to play for philadelphia in the 2001 finals, in front of family and friends in los angeles, his hometown. his most productive season was in 2002-3, when he averaged 6.5 points with milwaukee and seattle. he was the lesser-known part of the trade that also brought the sonics ray allen, a uconn teammate and one of ollie's best friends. the hardest part of any season, ollie said, is being away from his family. ollie and his wife, stephanie, have two children a 13-year-old son named jalen (for a childhood friend, not for jalen rose, part of a 2002 trade between chicago and indiana that sent ollie, brad miller, ron mercer and ron artest to the pacers) and a 9-year-old daughter named cheyenne (a city that ollie has not called home, if only because it does not have an n.b.a. franchise). ollie thought he found stability when he signed a five-year contract with cleveland in 2003. he bought a house and moved the family. he was traded to philadelphia a year later. the family has stayed in connecticut since, a skype call or an east coast trip away. missed occasions nag. \"jalen was in the championship game for football and i missed that game,\" ollie said. \"those memories i'll never get back again. that was one of the toughest days this year.\" ollie will re-evaluate whether he wants to extend his career this summer. \"i'll get back home, spend some time with my family, see the issues going on there with my son and my daughter, get a collective group feeling on whether i should play or not, and see if there are any feelers out there with me and my agent,\" he said. \"but nothing has been decided.\" he has no interest in setting any nomadic n.b.a. records. he would love to coach, and the relationships he has built quietly will have more worth than any of his on-court highlights. \"i'm not about making history,\" ollie said. \"i'm about creating a future.\"",

        "title": "pat quinn, coach who led canada to olympic gold, is dead at 71.",
        "abstract": "pat quinn, a popular hockey coach who followed up a bruising playing career by steering canada to its first olympic gold medal in 50 years and twice winning coach-of-the-year honors in the national hockey league, died on sunday at a hospital in vancouver. he was 71. the death was announced by the hockey hall of fame, of which quinn was the chairman. he had had heart problems for many years. quinn filled almost every role in hockey, including coach, general manager and owner. but his most memorable moment may have come as a 215-pound, 6-foot-3 defenseman for the toronto maple leafs in a playoff game in 1969 when he flattened the boston bruins superstar bobby orr. quinn got a major penalty for elbowing, although many observers thought it was a clean hit. \"it remains to this day one of the most celebrated body checks in n.h.l. history,\" the hockey news said in its obituary . quinn's greatest achievement, however, was steering team canada to victory, and its first gold medal since 1952, in the salt lake city olympics in 2002. wayne gretzky, who was the executive director of the 2002 team, attributed the victory to quinn. \"when the top guy doesn't have an ego and he's very protective of the group, i think that spreads like wildfire,\" gretzky told espn . quinn repeated his international success in 2004 by leading team canada to victory in hockey's world cup. quinn coached five n.h.l. teams the philadelphia flyers, the los angeles kings, the vancouver canucks, the maple leafs and the edmonton oilers over 21 seasons. he ranks fifth in games coached with 1,400, as well as fifth in regular-season wins with 684. in 1979-80, when he coached the flyers, the team went 35 straight games without a loss, setting a north american professional sports record. the streak included 25 wins and 10 ties. today's n.h.l. rules call for sudden-death overtimes and shootouts to settle ties, so a team would have to win outright in 35 straight games to tie the record. quinn won the jack adams award as coach of the year in 1980 and 1992, but he never won the stanley cup. the closest he came was the cup finals, which he reached in 1980 with philadelphia and in 1994 with vancouver. john brian patrick quinn was born on jan. 29, 1943, in hamilton, ontario. growing up there, he excelled at football as well as hockey. after five years in the hockey minor leagues, he joined the maple leafs in 1968. he played 99 games for toronto before he was sent to vancouver in the 1970 draft to fill the rosters of expansion teams in that city and in buffalo. he was sent to the atlanta flames in 1972. that summer, quinn broke a leg while showing his daughters how to use their new skateboard. he returned to play for the flames but soon realized his playing days were over. he began his coaching career as an assistant with the flyers and, after coaching their farm team, the maine mariners, became head coach in 1978. he pushed the hard-hitting philadelphia team whose nickname was the broad street bullies to rely less on physical intimidation and more on skills. one result was its undefeated streak. in 1984, after being fired by the flyers, quinn moved on to the kings. after three years there, he agreed to join the canucks as coach, president and general manager. john ziegler, the president of the n.h.l., found that quinn had secretly negotiated with vancouver while still employed by los angeles, a violation of league rules. quinn, the canucks and the kings were fined, and quinn was barred from coaching the canucks until the 1990-91 season. the canucks appealed, and the british columbia supreme court reduced their fine to $10,000, from $310,000, but sustained the coaching ban on quinn. the kings tried unsuccessfully to sue the canucks for tampering. quinn worked in the front office for vancouver and then took on coaching duties in 1990 when the ban expired. in 1998 he was appointed coach of the maple leafs, and the team went to the eastern conference finals in 1999 and 2002. during the 2002 playoffs, he collapsed on a trip to north carolina and was hospitalized with heart arrhythmia. he had been smoking five or six cigars a day and eating unhealthily. \"i had become something i'd always dreaded a fat ex-athlete,\" he told the website 50plus . he changed his eating and other habits and contributed to a book of heart-healthy recipes. after the leafs missed the playoffs in 2006, he was fired. he coached the edmonton oilers for the 2009-10 season and led canada's junior team to a gold medal in 2009. at his death he was a co-owner of the vancouver giants in the western hockey league. while he was playing and coaching, quinn earned an undergraduate degree in economics from york university and a law degree from widener university. he is survived by his wife, sandra; his daughters, valerie and kalli; and three grandchildren. it took years for quinn and orr, the victim of his famous body check, to become friends, but they did. \"in my mind,\" quinn said, \"the best i ever saw was bobby orr.\"",

        "title": "senate democrats to push expanded stimulus plan.",
        "abstract": "washington the majority leader, senator harry reid of nevada, said tuesday that democrats were prepared to force a showdown with republicans over a $204 billion economic stimulus package and would not bow to pressure to simply make modest changes to a less expensive plan that was approved by the house last week. \"we should go for the whole package,\" mr. reid said at a news conference. he waved off assertions by some republicans that he was bluffing. \"wait until we have this vote, and they'll find out,\" he said. \"i am not much of a bluffer.\" mr. reid is hoping to strong-arm the republicans into adopting the larger package favored by most democrats and some moderate republicans, or to compel them to vote against important provisions. that could prove politically costly in the fall elections. mr. reid's plan is to deny republicans a chance to vote on a package including some, but not all, of what the democrats are trying to add to the plan that passed the house in january. his approach reflects increasing confidence among democrats that recent news of worsening unemployment and growing fears of a recession have made it safe to push hard for their expanded package. but some republicans said that the democrats had miscalculated and risked being seen as playing politics with the economy. \"he doesn't have the votes,\" senator ted stevens of alaska, the most senior republican, said about mr. reid. \"he knows it, and we shouldn't be fooling around like this.\" the house proposal, worked out in a deal with the white house, is a more streamlined combination of tax rebates or payments for individuals and families and tax incentives for businesses. but more than 20 million americans living on social security and more than 250,000 disabled veterans would not qualify under that plan. the proposal favored by senate democrats would give payments to those living on social security and the disabled veterans, but it contains other provisions that many republicans say are too costly and should not be part of the stimulus plan, including an extension of unemployment benefits and tax incentives for the coal industry. the senate plan would cost about $204 billion over two years, roughly $40 billion more than the house version. in recent days, mr. reid added a $1 billion increase in home-energy subsidies for low-income families a move to expand a program democrats support but also to press republicans in states with high heating costs, among them senators john e. sununu and judd gregg of new hampshire and norm coleman of minnesota. mr. sununu and mr. coleman are both up for re-election. senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky, the republican leader, has indicated he would like to adopt the house plan with two changes the inclusion of those on social security and veterans, and a stipulation that illegal immigrant workers could not receive payments. he said tuesday that he would still seek that. last week, mr. reid and other democratic leaders had said they would hold a vote on just such a proposal, making it a fallback option. but on monday he said he would allow votes only on the full senate package and the original house plan with no changes. \"they are going to vote on this package,\" he said. \"the american people are watching.\" but only 3 of 10 republicans on the senate finance committee voted to expand the house package last week, suggesting democrats would fall short of the 60 votes needed. democrats control the senate 51 to 49, and mr. reid was being careful to schedule a vote on a day when the two democratic senators running for president could return to washington. though democrats predicted they could persuade more republicans, several republican senate aides said the democrats were at least two votes short. aides to senator john mccain, republican of arizona, said he had expressed his support for the house stimulus package but had not decided how to vote. some democrats had suggested that a tax incentive in the senate package, allowing businesses to deduct losses from up to five years ago, rather than just two years in current law, would help the timber industry and persuade alaska's two republican senators. mr. stevens rejected that. \"i have given them no reason to think that,\" he said. senator bob corker, republican of tennessee, said he would oppose both plans because they would add to the deficit and do little for the economy. \"this is to win public favor in an election year,\" he said. but some moderate republicans support the larger stimulus plan and are clearly uncomfortable with the current fight. \"the senate finance package is far more preferable,\" said senator olympia j. snowe, republican of maine, adding that it would help people in her state. \"you are out there on a daily basis struggling to make ends meet, with skyrocketing energy prices, home heating oil, gasoline, every dollar counts, and that's what this legislation is about.\"",

        "abstract": "paris (ap) -- the professional cycling teams' association is threatening to boycott the tour of beijing in october if the sport's governing body doesn't withdraw its proposed ban on radio communication during races by may 1. the association known as aigcp said in a statement that it has been banned by the uci from attending a meeting of cycling's stakeholders in milan on thursday at which the issue will be addressed. the aigcp says its members have signed a document stating that they won't participate in the tour of beijing from oct. 5-9 if the ban, due to be introduced \"progressively\" by the uci, is enforced. \"cycling is a team sport and, as such, communication is key for the athletes and the coaches,\" the aigcp said. \"we continue to hope -- and push -- for an amicable resolution to this issue. however, if the use of radios in all professional cycling events is not permitted by may 1, all of the teams have signed an accord that simply states that we will not participate in the tour of beijing.\" the aigcp is targeting the race in china because it is the only event in professional cycling that the uci not only governs but also promotes. \"this way we avoid actions that could be damaging for any race organizer that does not have any say or vote in the governance or regulation of the sport,\" aigcp chairman jonathan vaughters said. the teams organized a protest last month at the mallorca challenge to show their opposition to the ban. the uci says radio communication on the road distorts the true nature of the sport, however most teams say the use of earpieces makes riders safer. earlier this month, uci president pat mcquaid said the ban would be implemented as planned but agreed to a request from the aigcp to assess it on a regular basis. however, he later risked antagonizing the teams by saying they would be better off discussing more important issues with the uci like the fight against doping rather than the ban. vaughters maintains that teams and riders should have a greater role within the sport's governing body, and the aigcp said the uci's decision to bar the association from thursday's meeting won't help to ease tensions. \"our objective in this action is to ensure that the people that actively work in field of professional cycling also have a vote in its regulation,\" the aigcp said. \"fair, logical, and agreed-upon regulations are our goal. we hope the uci will become our partner in achieving this objective.\" the uci first banned radio communications last season in lower-level races.",

        "abstract": "when duke, kentucky, kansas and michigan state converged on madison square garden's hardcourt on tuesday night, men's college basketball fans were treated to the first-, second-, seventh- and 13th-ranked teams in the country. the event was a potential final four preview, five months early. it was also a vivid reminder that the sport remains an oligarchy. this was the sixth straight year these programs competed in the so-called champions classic, broadcast on espn, with the no. 2 wildcats defeating the no. 13 spartans, 69-48, followed by the no. 7 jayhawks defeating the no. 1 blue devils, 77-75, in the final seconds. a month from now, four other top programs with similar pedigrees well, three plus kentucky, since the wildcats will appear in both will meet in las vegas for another annual event, called the cbs sports classic. for three years now, it will have featured the same four programs: north carolina, ohio state, u.c.l.a. and kentucky. \"these are the blue bloods of the sport,\" said dan weinberg, cbs sports's executive vice president for programming, referring to the teams in his network's event next month, although the statement was also true of tuesday's event. \"they have won for a long, long time.\" as a new college basketball season opens, having formally tipped off just a few days ago, these early showcases are both symptoms and self-reinforcing causes of the sport's status quo, in which the most fortunate programs find themselves in a virtuous cycle involving wins, money, coaching and recruits as well as exposure, which is where these annual early-season mini-tournaments come in. the sport is not quite the autocracy it was when u.c.l.a. won 10 national titles in 12 years in the 1960s and '70s under coach john wooden. nor is it as top-heavy as the current women's game, so dominated by coach geno auriemma's connecticut. but division i men's basketball, symbolically the n.c.a.a.'s most open sport with a postseason tournament renowned for binding together 32 otherwise disparate conferences and for featuring unpredictable upsets and lovable underdogs is far from a democracy. image tyler ulis of kentucky driving against duke's derryck thornton during last november's champions classic. credit jonathan daniel/getty images \"the deck is stacked against these smaller teams, smaller programs, because it's not in anyone's interests to have it any other way,\" said david carter, who directs the sports business institute at the university of southern california. one sign that these few top programs are virtually guaranteed to remain perennial contenders: in august, espn signed its four teams to the champions classic through 2019, and cbs may be looking to do something similar; weinberg said his company \"really likes the deal.\" \"in every sport, there are certain schools or teams that carry glamour, that carry history, that carry passionate fan bases,\" said ilan ben-hanan, espn's vice president for college sports programming. \"duke, kansas, kentucky and michigan state have long histories, a lot of success,\" he added, \"and while you don't know what the future's going to hold, chances are they're going to be good for years down the line.\" such confidence in future squads ought to be remarkable, since the best college basketball players depart after just one or two seasons. kentucky's roster three years from now, for example, is unknowable. but espn and cbs can have faith because, in college basketball, the rich have stayed rich. consider that every final four going back to 1987, except 2013's, has featured at least one of the seven teams in these two showcases. during that span, all except ohio state have won the national championship. and these early-season events are not mere bystanders to this phenomenon. the opportunity for this kind of exposure wearing a famous jersey while competing against players wearing other famous jerseys, in a famous arena on national television in prime time as the college season tips off is something these programs can sell to prospects. \"kids love that stuff,\" said corey evans, the managing editor of hoopseen, which covers college basketball recruiting. \"we're adults, and we love that stuff. can you imagine being 17?\" more broadly, in recruiting, evans added, there is a \"high-major rung and a high-high-major rung.\" not infrequently, a top prospect will mull several offers from big-time programs near where he grew up, only to have north carolina or kentucky or kansas swoop in with a scholarship offer at the last moment; such a player will nearly always say yes to the blue-chip (and frequently blue-hued) latecomer. the one-and-done phenomenon actually increases these programs' advantages, according to evans, since rather than plucking just a couple of top prospects per high school class, the extra turnover requires that they sign half a roster's worth with each new season. \"in the past, they'd need two or three guys,\" evans said. \"now it's six or seven every year. some of those guys who might have gone to north carolina state or tennessee or virginia tech or georgetown, now they're going to duke.\" there are other advantages these programs enjoy, such as fan bases and donors to finance better facilities and higher salaries for coaches. recruiting successes also beget more recruiting successes, as college coaches can show the most talented prospects that they know how to get players selected high in the n.b.a. draft. this overarching dynamic did not preclude a midmajor (butler) from playing its way into two consecutive title games recently, nor does it keep programs like gonzaga or wichita state from consistent excellence. no. 3 villanova, the defending national champion, is a somewhat idiosyncratic exception to this rule, as in a parallel sense is its conference, the big east. still, carter described the programs in these early-season showcases as \"big-market teams,\" not unlike baseball's yankees or the n.b.a.'s los angeles lakers. he acknowledged the telling irony in applying the term \"big market\" to towns like chapel hill and durham, n.c.; lexington, ky.; east lansing, mich.; and lawrence, kan. but, he explained, \"cable television has been able to deliver national brands in other markets not just to alumni in los angeles or new york being able to follow michigan state, but building a national following among young people who would have no exposure to that team otherwise.\" he added, \"there are quite a few big brands from small markets.\"",

        "title": "google exit appears to benefit top china rival, baidu.",
        "abstract": "shanghai china's top internet search company, baidu, is emerging as a big winner after google's recent retreat from china, as it smashed analysts' forecasts, suggesting increased business from advertisers. baidu posted first-quarter net profit of 481 million renminbi, or $70.4 million, up from 181 million renminbi a year ago. analysts expected profit of 366 million renminbi, according to thomson reuters data. \"it's not going to happen overnight, but over time google's traffic will decline gradually, and over time we expect one-third of the advertising dollar to shift to baidu,\" said elinor leung, an analyst for clsa in hong kong, who said that could take two or three years. baidu captured more than 64 percent of china's internet search market in the first quarter, up from 58.4 percent in the fourth quarter, while google's share fell to 31 percent from 35.6 percent, according to the research company analysys international. after warning in january that it might pull out of china, google shut its mainland chinese-language portal and began rerouting searches to its hong kong site in late march, to avoid self-censorship demands from beijing. baidu's increased market share in the first quarter might partly reflect the lead-up to google's exit. baidu, whose name comes from a song dynasty poem about a man searching for his love, has grown from a tiny player operating out of a dingy beijing hotel room to the top search company in china the world's largest internet market, with 400 million users on a sprawling campus. \"we saw marginal benefit from this so-called semi-exit of google,\" robin li, baidu's charismatic chief executive, said during a conference call to discuss his company's results. \"we are certainly benefiting from this. but at the end of the day, the china search market is still in its very early stage,\" mr. li said. \"the performance of baidu is largely driven by our own execution, not the competitive landscape change.\" many brokers had upgraded their ratings and earnings forecasts for baidu for 2010 after google's shocking announcement in january. baidu expects second-quarter revenue to jump 67 percent to 70 percent, easily outstripping investors' estimates. it forecast revenue of between 1.83 billion and 1.87 billion renminbi. \"baidu's first-quarter results beat our and consensus numbers nicely, but second-quarter revenue guidance is a blowout number,\" ming zhao, an analyst at susquehanna financial group, said in a research note. baidu's new advertising keyword system was fully implemented in december, providing a more sophisticated targeting and bidding for search keywords and tools to track user traffic. investors are monitoring the long-term effect on baidu's operations from google's highly public spat with beijing and the subsequent withdrawal of its search engine from china. despite the shuttering of its google.cn site, google continues to sell advertisements in china via its hong kong site, google.hk, which now has a version using simplified chinese characters specifically targeted at mainland users.",

        "abstract": "tim donaghy , the disgraced former n.b.a. referee, has overstated the extent of his cooperation with the government, federal prosecutors said in a court filing friday. but the prosecutors did not specifically refute any of the recent charges donaghy made about n.b.a. officiating. donaghy has accused n.b.a. executives and referees of broad misconduct, including the manipulation of game results. those allegations were detailed in a june 10 court filing by his lawyer, john lauro, who presented them as evidence of donaghy's extensive cooperation with the government. in their response, federal prosecutors wrote that lauro's letter contained \"certain statements that overstate the nature and value of his cooperation.\" the value of donaghy's cooperation will play a key role in his sentencing, which is scheduled for july 14 in united states district court in brooklyn. according to the federal prosecutors, the allegations of referee misconduct contained in lauro's letter are not relevant to his plea for a lighter sentence because the government's investigation \"did not lead to evidence of prosecutable federal offenses.\" n.b.a. commissioner david stern has adamantly defended the league's referees and has dismissed donaghy's recent claims as \"baseless.\" to support his position, stern has repeatedly pointed out that only donaghy has been charged with a crime. legal experts, however, have noted that it was possible that federal investigators found proof of misconduct that fell short of a criminal act. despite their objections to some of lauro's characterizations, the prosecutors continue to support donaghy's plea for a lighter sentence. they credited donaghy with providing \"substantial assistance\" and asked that the court \"take his cooperation into account.\" donaghy has admitted to providing inside information to gamblers and helping them pick games to bet on. he pleaded guilty to two felonies last august and faces up to 25 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. under federal sentencing guidelines, the term will probably be about 33 months and could be reduced further at next month's hearing. the prosecutors disputed several other assertions made by donaghy in recent court filings. donaghy claimed to have cooperated with the authorities before the government had proof of his wrongdoing. according to the prosecutors' letter, \"we already had evidence of his involvement\" before he came forward. donaghy has also stated that he tried to contact the n.b.a. to provide similar assistance. league officials, the prosecutors note, have disputed that claim. the prosecutors also mildly rebuked lauro for his june 10 letter, which he presented on the premise that the government had not sufficiently described the extent of donaghy's cooperation. lauro offered his letter as a supplement to the government's sentencing letter. according to the prosecutors, \"donaghy has no authority to 'supplement' \" their letter. in a second, 26-page filing, the prosecutors disputed lauro's interpretation of the monetary \"loss\" to the n.b.a. caused by donaghy's misconduct. they also contested a motion by lauro to consider donaghy's possible gambling addiction as a factor in sentencing.",

        "title": "distillery caters to locavores who love a cocktail.",
        "abstract": "local lore suggests the cocktail was invented in elmsford around the time of the revolutionary war, when a barmaid would garnish drinks with the tail feathers of roosters from loyalist chicken coops. and it's a fact that purchase has long been the united states base of the french spirits giant pernod ricard (absolut, beefeater, kahlua) and that new rochelle is home to sidney frank spirits importer (jagermeister). but despite westchester county's intoxicating background, there had been no alcoholic spirits distilled there since prohibition. no legal spirits, at least. that changed last august when a fledgling distillery released its first wares from an industrial enclave along the byram river in port chester. made from pure honey, stilltheone distillery 's comb vodka , comb 9 gin and, new last month, comb blossom brandy are getting raves from cocktail experts both in and beyond the county's borders, much to the satisfaction of its local owners, ed and laura tiedge. the distillery's name refers to the 26-year marriage of the pelham manor couple, who came into the distilling business through a mixture of necessity, passion for their product and a little bit of fate. \"i was a bond trader for years,\" said mr. tiedge, who wears the hats of distiller and salesman. \"but when the job landscape became really rocky and my stock options became worthless, i had to start thinking about what else i could to do to pay the mortgage and finish getting my kids through college.\" given his analytical background and passion for food, becoming a math teacher or going to culinary school were among the possibilities. while doing research, he learned that new york's distillery licensing fees had changed to allow small-batch distillers to get a license for about $1,500 a small fraction of the $50,000 fee the state had previously levied. \"i realized that a distillery's start-up and fixed overhead costs could be manageable,\" he said. but the decision to make the leap wasn't an easy one. \"we thought long and hard before we put savings into this it's risky and a little bit scary,\" said mrs. tiedge, who works full time as the senior director of healthy living for the rye ymca while holding the titles of social media guru and c.t.o. (chief tasting officer) at stilltheone. \"but it's been a great adventure,\" she said. \"we've been fortunate.\" one unexpected catalyst of their good fortune was the racing green porsche 911 turbo mr. tiedge had purchased during his heyday in finance and ended up selling for some of the seed money. confiding the reason for the sale to the car's swiss buyer, markus matuschka, he discovered that mr. matuschka just happened to own a cognac distillery. mr. tiedge was invited to spend two months in france and switzerland to apprentice and soak up as much information as possible. but if apprenticing in europe sounds glamorous, stilltheone's cavernous space filled with glass beakers and hydrometers, a variety of hulking fermentation tanks and stills, and cartons of as-yet-unused bottles speaks to the science and hard labor involved in the distilling business, especially with a unique, untried product. \"laura and i wanted to do something special,\" mr. tiedge said. \"the world doesn't need another $40 potato vodka.\" while learning about mead (honey wine), mr. tiedge hit upon the idea of distilling the honey into vodka. as he tested different varieties of honey and strains of yeast he discovered that, in addition to being a more expensive base ingredient than potatoes, honey is tricky to work with. \"the first full-scale test to make 500 gallons of the base honey wine required 1,100 pounds half a metric ton of orange blossom honey,\" mr. tiedge said. \"it was a nerve-wracking $2,500 experiment. lucky for us, it was a success.\" it takes about a gallon of honey to make the same quantity of spirits, and, though not a flavored vodka, comb vodka subtly retains its base ingredient's characteristics a slight, very appealing viscosity and exceptional smoothness. \"it's great in a martini or for sipping straight up or on the rocks,\" joseph price, the mixologist at plates in larchmont, was overheard telling a customer. the tiedges chose orange blossom honey over clover or wildflower because the flower's essence complements so many cocktail ingredients, especially citrus. \"comb expresses itself beautifully in mixed drinks when we tasted it, we were very excited by the cocktail possibilities,\" said christopher gambelli, wine director for moderne barn, whose gorgeously vibrant honey wallbanger tarts up the vodka with peak-of-the-season blood orange juice. plates's popular tuscan tangelini also takes advantage of comb and seasonal citrus pairing, giving freshly squeezed tangelo juice the honeyed background notes of the vodka and a lightly herbaceous counterpoint with star anise-and-fennel-seed-infused simple syrup. botanicals like juniper, licorice root, galangal and lavender are among those with which the tiedges infuse the honey spirit to make the comb 9 gin, which, like the vodka, sells for about $35 for a fifth. the signature blend gives drinks like the classic negroni a distinctive, floral nose. stilltheone also creates proprietary gins. a former marine, mr. tiedge is especially proud of the jarhead gin he developed exclusively for, and donated to, a recent wounded warrior project auction fund-raiser, to benefit veterans of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. for blue hill at stone barns, he worked with the general manager, philippe gouze, to carefully make the soon-to-be-released from the field gin. \"we taste a lot of spirits, but we were immediately impressed with ed's and started featuring them,\" mr. gouze said. \"they're of such high quality, made with so much love and right in our area. we wanted to work with him.\" from the field incorporates stone barns's own honey and herbs. the latest comb spirit was recently released from its six months in new oak. mr. tiedge learned his cognac lessons well. comb blossom brandy (about $26 a pint) has a touch of sweetness on the nose and is very smooth on the palate. right now mr. tiedge said he was measuring success \"one case at a time.\" but he's just put in a larger, as yet untried, fermentation tank, and he's expanding the distillery space by 60 percent to create a separate area for bottling, as well as for aging his brandy. the tiedges enjoy having their business close to home in westchester, where their children, sarah and erik, and their friends sometimes pitch in for bottling or cleaning the tanks. \"the local restaurants and liquor stores have been so supportive,\" mrs. tiedge said. \"we're so grateful for all the people who want to see us succeed.\" many of those restaurants and stores are listed on stilltheone's web site ( combvodka.com ). the distillery is licensed to distribute comb products only in new york, so out-of-state imbibers might have to wait for a taste until there's broader distribution. given the growing number of fans, that probably won't be for long just last month comb vodka took a silver medal at the san francisco world spirits competition, a fitting footnote to the new chapter in westchester cocktail history.",

        "title": "good things can come to those who wait for the n.b.a.",
        "abstract": "it wasn't long after the n.b.a. draft finished in 2013 that the mock drafts came out for the next year, guesses made by anyone with a website and a stray thought about where the talent would be headed. predictably, the super prospects andrew wiggins and jabari parker were listed at the top. they were certain lottery picks, guaranteed to make millions as rookies in the league. down the list, names like wayne selden jr. popped up players with loads of potential, but not sure things. while selden showed glimpses of his talent during his freshman season at kansas, his stock never rose much as the season progressed. so, about the time his teammate wiggins was opting for the n.b.a. after one college season, selden was making a tough decision: he would stay for at least one more year. \"we didn't accomplish what we wanted,\" he said. \"i wanted more.\" he was referring to kansas's elimination in the first weekend of the n.c.a.a. tournament, as well as the way he played. selden struggled with a nagging knee injury, only rarely showing his skills. he thought another year in college could help his draft stock. he wasn't alone in deciding to stick around. the harrison twins, aaron and andrew, made the same choice after leading kentucky within one victory of a national title. so did their teammate dakari johnson, the arizona small forward rondae hollis-jefferson, the arkansas power forward bobby portis and the louisiana state power forward jarell martin. each was a potential draft pick, and some might have gone late in the first round, receiving the guaranteed contract that is not afforded to second-round picks. but they opted instead for one more season in college. \"you can't really base your decision off what other people say,\" said andrew harrison, who also wanted to play one more season alongside his brother. \"you just have to focus on what you think you can do and what you think is best for you and your family.\" the business of the decision certainly cannot be discounted. when wiggins went no. 1 over all in this year's draft, he received a rookie contract that could be worth about $24.8 million, with roughly $11.2 million the first two years guaranteed. u.c.l.a.'s kyle anderson received the last of the guaranteed deals as the final pick in the first round a maximum of about $5.6 million, with $2.2 million guaranteed. the first player taken in the second round, the french prospect damien inglis, signed with the bucks for just over $800,000 each of the next two years, with a third year unguaranteed. \"i've had players, i've said, 'do you really know what you're doing?' \" kentucky coach john calipari said. \" 'you know you're probably going to go in the second round. i know you're being told you'll go in the first round. i'm telling you, you're going to go in the second round, maybe. what if you don't get drafted? are you o.k.?' \" while no freshmen were taken after the first round in this year's draft, seven of them have been picked in the second round since 2010. only two are still in the n.b.a. calipari has become synonymous with the one-and-done movement, or as he puts it, \"succeed and proceed.\" but he is among the many coaches who would prefer the rule be scrapped in the next round of collective bargaining between the n.b.a. and the players union when it expires in 2017. calipari would prefer a two-year rule, or something similar to the rules in baseball, where prospects can turn pro out of high school but must remain in school for three years if they decide to go to college. adam silver, the new n.b.a. commissioner, said in april that he was also in favor of a two-year requirement, and that such a threshold would also contribute to a better professional product. besides, calipari said, many players, like his junior center willie cauley-stein , already know they aren't ready for the n.b.a. \"willie cauley, after the championship the next morning, we meet, and i congratulate him and tell him: 'hey, man, you're in the top 15. i'm happy for you. good luck.' the next day he comes in and says, 'coach, i'm staying,' \" calipari said. \"i go, 'what? tell me why.' 'i'm not ready to have an impact in that league and i know that. i'm going to be able to get my degree and i haven't won a championship and i want to win a championship.' good reasons, so he comes back.\" arizona coach sean miller tries to supply all the information he can to prospects weighing the stay-or-go decision, but he ultimately leaves it in the hands of players and their families. still, he quickly points to derrick williams a fringe draft prospect after his freshman season as evidence that sticking around for another year isn't such a bad thing. \"if someone would have told me that derrick would have been the no. 2 pick in the n.b.a. draft as a sophomore, i mean, you would have bet the house that wouldn't have been the case,\" miller said. \"it's so difficult to predict something that's so hard to do. russell westbrook, those who followed his high school career, who would have ever thought he would have become the player he is so quickly?\"",

        "title": "the youtube brawler kimbo slice tries an m.m.a. comeback.",
        "abstract": "it seems like an eternity ago in the fast-maturing world of mixed martial arts , but there was a time when a man named kimbo slice was the most talked about fighter in the country. slice made his reputation in the early 2000s, appearing in unsanctioned street fights that were taped and uploaded to the internet in the days when seeing a video on your computer still seemed really neat. his bald head, bushy beard, gold teeth and fearlessness made him instantly recognizable, and he became a cult figure, even appearing on the cover of espn the magazine in 2008. slice's street brawling notoriety he was said to be 22-1 in the unregulated bouts earned him a mixed martial arts career. \"kimbo is tailor-made for the age we're living in,\" a mixed martial arts website editor, adam swift, told the new york times at the time. \"we're an internet-driven culture, a reality-driven culture. he has a natural charisma and a marketable look.\" after a few bouts in the elite xc fight league, he got a spot in the top promotion, the ultimate fighting championship. but while slice packed a good punch, his wrestling and other skills were sorely lacking. he washed out of \"the ultimate fighter\" reality show and was 1-1 in official u.f.c. fights before being cut in 2010. in the years since, slice has turned to boxing and is 7-0 against unheralded competition. now five years later, he is returning to mixed martial arts for the first time. on friday in st. louis, he will fight ken shamrock in the bellator promotion on spike tv. shamrock's own long career spans the history of mixed martial arts. it has included an appearance at the very first u.f.c. card, in 1993, and fights against well-known heavyweights like royce gracie, bas rutten and tito ortiz. shamrock's nickname is the world's most dangerous man, but like slice he has been out of the m.m.a. ring since 2010. and at 51, he is a decade older than slice. the two almost fought before, in a highly anticipated fight in 2008, when slice was at the peak of his fame. the bout was to be telecast on cbs, a big showcase for the sport, largely because of slice's popularity. but shamrock suffered a cut in warm-ups and controversially pulled out. a replacement, seth petruzelli, proceeded to knock out slice in just 14 seconds . today, the u.f.c. is aiming for mainstream sports credibility, and fighters like jon jones and ronda rousey are household names. friday night's fight between two aging, apparently washed-up fighters who still have name recognition is a throwback to the early days, when everything about mixed martial arts seemed fly-by-night, if not vaguely unethical. athletes in many sports hang around well past their prime, sometimes to the point of embarrassment. but when the bell rings friday night, there will no doubt be many old-school fighting fans hoping slice and shamrock bring back a little of the wild-and-woolly early days of m.m.a.",

        "title": "from back of g.o.p. pack, huckabee is stirring.",
        "abstract": "cedar rapids, iowa , nov. 8 mike huckabee 's field staff had expected a modest crowd for a campaign event at a tiny rural community college near here on wednesday. but as people began to cram into the shoe-box-size room, campaign organizers scurried to roll back a dividing wall and set up extra chairs. to the huckabee campaign, it was another small note in a recent trickle of encouraging moments. his fund-raising is up, the campaign just received its first major christian conservative endorsement and most of all to mr. huckabee's obvious delight opponents are beginning to take potshots at him. \"i've always said as a hunter, 'you never put the cross hairs on a dead carcass,'\" mr. huckabee, a former arkansas governor, told reporters wednesday. \"you only aim for something that's alive that you'd like to take home.\" with less than two months until iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, there are signs that mr. huckabee, a former baptist pastor for whom bible verses flow easily off the tongue, is charming, quipping and sermonizing his way from a long shot ensconced in the second tier of the republican presidential sweepstakes to a possible contender here. \"the candidate du jour right now is mike huckabee,\" said chuck laudner, executive director of the iowa republican party . \"he certainly can win. it's still a wide-open race here in iowa.\" even if mr. huckabee wins here, what that would mean over the course of the campaign is another question. he would be vastly underfinanced and underorganized going into a crush of contests in big and expensive states. a victory here would also put intense scrutiny on his record as governor, which has been largely ignored in the focus on his republican rivals, rudolph w. giuliani, senator john mccain of arizona, fred d. thompson and mitt romney. still, there is a new sense of possibility in the huckabee campaign. it has been fueled in large part by evangelicals, including a politically active home-schooling population, dissatisfied with his better-financed competitors. mr. romney continues to lead state polls and has made significant inroads among christian conservatives, but many are searching for an alternative. on thursday, mr. huckabee scored his first endorsement from a prominent christian conservative leader, the rev. donald e. wildmon, founder of the american family association. meanwhile, mr. thompson, who is vying for the same conservative mantle, singled out mr. huckabee this week, calling him a \"pro-life liberal.\" mr. huckabee fired back in an interview with marc ambinder, a political blogger. \"the writers guild is on strike, and fred is kind of struggling to get some lines,\" he said. \"whoever put that line together is writing for comedy and not for a serious political drama.\" but other christian conservative leaders have been reluctant to get behind mr. huckabee's campaign, in no small part because they worry that he cannot win the nomination, much less the general election. beyond that, they wonder whether this former governor who has never served in washington has the credentials to be a wartime president, and they fret that he does not have the resources to compete in 50 states against someone like mr. giuliani, a supporter of abortion rights whom many conservatives want to stop at all costs. mr. huckabee has depicted the leaders' lack of support as a source of strength, adding, \"some people have become more process-focused than they are principle-focused.\" while mr. huckabee's fund-raising still badly trails that of his better-known rivals, as well as that of representative ron paul, republican of texas, his campaign took in more than $1 million online in october, more than it raised in the entire third quarter. most of the donations came in 10 days at the end of the month, on the heels of a strong debate performance, a rousing speech at the values voter summit in washington and, as mr. huckabee invariably inserts in interviews, an endorsement by chuck norris, the martial arts star. in that period, the campaign saw web site traffic jump to levels second among republicans only to that of mr. paul, who has a strong base of internet supporters, forcing it to upgrade its server three times. chip saltsman, mr. huckabee's campaign manager, maps out a series of events, though somewhat short on details, of his candidate scoring a victory or strong second in iowa that could earn him bushels of media coverage, then drawing on resources he has held back to compete in new hampshire and south carolina, where he says the campaign has built viable field staffs. mr. saltsman predicts that other prominent contenders will fade, narrowing the field to perhaps two major candidates. after that, he said, the campaign could take advantage of money pouring in from the early momentum to compete in the crush of states holding primaries on feb. 5. mr. laudner said prospects beyond iowa remained mr. huckabee's chief hurdle among politically savvy caucusgoers. \"if there isn't going to be enough money to compete beyond iowa and new hampshire,\" he said, \"that goes to the heart of the viability question. that's his no. 1 limit here.\" mr. huckabee has a homespun approach that draws heavily on the story of his climb from humble roots a generation, he likes to say, from \"dirt floors and outdoor bathrooms\" to the governor's office, where he served for more than a decade in a largely democratic state. he promotes a populist message that seeks to tap into the economic anxiety he says many working-class families feel. conservative stances on social issues are at the center of his campaign, but he often tempers them with a declaration of the need to end the divisiveness plaguing the country. he is one of few republican candidates to speak out on environmental issues. he is an ardent proponent of the \"fair tax,\" which would scrap the national income tax for a national sales tax. he talks tough on securing the borders and refusing amnesty to illegal immigrants, but he championed a bill in arkansas that would have made illegal immigrants eligible for in-state tuition and scholarships. in short, he is difficult to categorize politically, even as he has sought to play up his conservative credentials for the primaries. as he has begun to edge up in some polls, his rivals have seized on his record, accusing him of being soft on illegal immigration , which he denies. the fiscal group club for growth has attacked his fiscal conservative credentials for months and recently started a web site, taxhikemike.org . for his part, mr. huckabee has thrown darts at his republican rivals in a folksy manner, fueling speculation that he is really running for the vice presidency. but some republican critics in his home state say there is more below his affable exterior. \"he, historically, has acted very thin-skinned,\" said joe yates, one of mr. huckabee's top advisers in the governor's office who does not support his candidacy. \"when somebody criticized him, he reacted.\"",

(reuters) bremen signs brazilian werder bremen agreed to sign the 23-year-old midfielder wesley from the brazilian club santos on a four-year deal, the club said. the acquisition comes only days after werder bremen, which is on course to qualify for the champions league group stage after beating sampdoria of italy, 3-1, in the first leg of a playoff last wednesday, sold the playmaker mesut ozil to real madrid. (reuters) argentina coach names squad argentina's interim coach, sergio batista, put his stamp on the post-diego maradona era by recalling the world cup absentees javier zanetti, esteban cambiasso and andres d'alessandro to the national squad. batista, who is hoping to remove the interim tag from his title later this year, also named the barcelona defender gabriel milito to a 23-man squad for a sept. 7 friendly against the world cup champion spain in buenos aires.

        "abstract": "in the year since the government stepped in to rescue the collapsing mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac , the agencies have taken $96 billion from the treasury , and may still need more. that was the somber assessment delivered thursday by the federal agency charged with overseeing the government-controlled fannie and freddie, which have lost a combined $165 billion since july 2007 as their bets on the housing market went bad. \"the short-term outlook for the enterprises remains troubled,\" said edward j. demarco, acting director of the federal housing finance agency, in testimony before the senate banking committee. fannie mae and freddie mac, which bought millions of home mortgages, were taken over by the government last september after their share prices plummeted and investors abandoned the companies, fearing they would collapse under the weight of their loan portfolios. the government put fannie and freddie into a conservatorship and offered billions in federal lifelines. now, as housing prices struggle higher and an $8,000 tax credit has enticed many first-time home buyers into the market, fannie and freddie are limping along. the federal reserve is buying more than $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities in an effort to loosen credit and restart the mortgage-financing markets. yet even as the broader economy tries to turns a corner, fannie and freddie face huge obstacles, mr. demarco said. their books are still bleeding red as foreclosures rise and homeowners even the highest-quality borrowers fall behind on their mortgage payments. several crucial positions remain vacant, and mr. demarco said the agencies were worried about losing workers because of the uncertainties surrounding their fate. right now, 3.1 percent of freddie mac loans are seriously delinquent, and fannie's seriously delinquency rate is an even higher 4.2 percent, mr. demarco testified. and as unemployment nears 10 percent and homeowners struggle to persuade lenders to refinance their mortgages, delinquency rates are rising. fannie and freddie now manage nearly 100,000 foreclosed properties, and those numbers are almost certain to grow.",

        "abstract": "miami as gov. rick scott faced mounting questions about the ouster of the top state law enforcement chief and allegations of improper political meddling, two influential fellow republicans called for an inquiry on thursday into the potentially damaging accusations. the two men, jeff atwater, the chief financial officer, and adam putnam, the agriculture commissioner members of florida's independently elected three-person cabinet said the allegations made by gerald bailey, the state's longtime commissioner of the department of law enforcement, were serious enough to warrant an investigation by a third party. \"there should be some follow-up to those allegations and whether they were incidents of illegal activity versus sloppy, campaign-official-type interactions that occurred,\" mr. putnam told reporters after an event. in a recent interview with the miami herald/tampa bay times capital bureau, mr. bailey, who is widely respected, said governor scott had lied when telling the florida cabinet that mr. bailey had willingly resigned from his job as commissioner in december. the three cabinet members who, along with the governor, oversee the law enforcement post said they had not known until after the vote to hire a new commissioner that mr. bailey had been ousted. mr. bailey said he had been forced out of the job after he refused to acquiesce to repeated requests by governor scott and his staff to violate policy, take political sides and, in one case, target a county clerk for something she had not done and then falsify a news release. so far, governor scott has avoided most questions about the matter, but on thursday his office released responses to some of the allegations. \"gerald bailey did the right thing by stepping down,\" he said on wednesday. \"what i've done, as i've done in this job and i did in the private sector, is keep finding new people, find new energy, new ideas. i'm going to continue to do that.\" the florida department of law enforcement was created in 1967 to help remove the taint of politics and corruption from law enforcement. the agency's commissioner reports to both the governor and the cabinet, which also includes pam bondi, the florida attorney general. this has served to insulate the department from any one powerful politician and to bolster its independence. the agency has been called upon to investigate matters ranging from political corruption to high-profile criminal cases around the state. but mr. bailey, who was appointed commissioner under jeb bush, the former governor, went on to make other allegations, as well. he told reporters that governor scott's former chief of staff had pressured him to falsely target the orange county clerk of court after two prisoners escaped in 2013 using forged papers from her office. the escape embarrassed the department of corrections. mr. bailey said that he had refused, and that there was no evidence the clerk was involved. the governor's press office, in its detailed response, called mr. bailey's allegation unfounded. the office said the discussion with mr. bailey on the matter was not about targeting any individual. mr. bailey also said he and his agents had been asked to cross political lines. governor scott's office, he said, wanted the agency to drive the governor's campaign workers in state vehicles, a rule violation. and mr. bailey added that mr. scott's campaign had asked for help in writing the governor's law enforcement platform, another violation. in addition, mr. bailey said the governor had asked him to intercede in an out-of-state money laundering investigation on a donor whom the governor wanted to appoint to a state board. governor scott has said he made no such request. as for his own ouster, mr. bailey said that governor scott's former general counsel had told him to resign immediately or risk being fired because the cabinet no longer supported him. cabinet members, though, have said they had not lost confidence in him. ms. bondi said in a statement this week that she had \"serious questions\" about the circumstances surrounding mr. bailey's departure and the quick appointment of his successor, rick swearingen. mr. atwater was the first of the three cabinet members to call for more transparency in making appointments. he has requested that a more public search begin anew for the state law enforcement commissioner. both mr. atwater and mr. putnam are viewed as possible candidates for governor in 2018. while governor scott says he will support mr. swearingen, he is not opposed to reopening the search for commissioner.",

        "abstract": "beijing the signs of grief were subtle. there were the initials of the victims scrawled on the back of the shoes, and a quick, impromptu moment of silence before the match. but the emotion was obvious on sunday after the united states men's volleyball team won its opening olympic match without coach hugh mccutcheon, whose father-in-law was stabbed to death at a popular beijing tourist site the day before. when mccutcheon became the head coach of the team in early 2005, he set the agenda for the next few years with one thing in mind. \"he said, 'hey, this first match in the olympic games is what we're gearing up for,'\" the team captain and middle blocker thomas hoff said. \"obviously, we wish he could be here, even though we understand why he's not.\" the americans, considered a medal contender, needed all five sets to beat venezuela, making its olympic volleyball debut. and when it ended, the fading shock and lingering emotion of the previous 24 hours were evident by the hushed tones of players, coaches and officials. it remains uncertain whether mccutcheon will return to the team. the assistant ron larsen was elevated to interim coach in mccutcheon's absence. \"i'd much rather be sitting on the bench, telling him what i think we should be doing and having him say, i don't think so, rather than where i am right now,\" larsen said. the father-in-law, todd bachman, 62, died saturday after being attacked at the drum tower. his wife, barbara, sustained many stab wounds and underwent eight hours of surgery on saturday. she was in stable but critical condition on sunday. one of their three daughters, elisabeth bachman mccutcheon, who played on the 2004 united states women's olympic volleyball team and married mccutcheon in december 2006, was with her parents during the attack. she was not injured. the attacker, identified by xinhua news agency as 47-year-old tang yongming of hangzhou in zhejiang province, jumped to his death from a 130-foot balcony of the tower, originally constructed in the 13th century. the three americans were not wearing anything that identified them as part of the united states olympic delegation, according to the united states olympic committee, leading to the belief that it was a random act of violence. mccutcheon, a 38-year-old new zealander, spoke to the team on saturday night via conference call. it was a sort of pep talk, for the people on both ends. mccutcheon did not tell his players whether he planned to rejoin the team during the tournament, which extends to aug. 24, the last day of the olympics. \"hugh is attending to wiz and to mrs. bachman,\" the team manager, rob browning, said before the match, using elisabeth bachman mccutcheon's nickname. \"he doesn't know if or when he'll be able to return to the team.\" there was no discussion about postponing sunday's match. \"it was never offered, never considered,\" browning said. the teams took the court at the same time to polite applause. many in the crowd probably did not know about the attack because it was not widely reported in the chinese news media. many of the spectators were from china and wore matching shirts. they were brought in by olympics organizers to help fill the venues and add to the atmosphere with choreographed cheers. the americans cruised through the first two sets, but struggled to shake the venezuelans. the fans began pulling for the underdog. venezuela won the third and fourth sets, but the americans regrouped to claim victory, 25-18, 25-18, 22-25, 21-25, 15-10. the players slid through the mixed zone, the lane between the court and the locker room where interviews are conducted, without stopping to talk to the dozens of american journalists who had come to watch a match that otherwise would have attracted few. questions at the coaches' news conference were almost entirely for larsen, not venezuela coach ricardo navajas. larsen cited the strong ties between the bachmans and usa volleyball. \"i think the best way we can honor them is to do the only thing we can do, and that is to go out and compete every day and work hard every day, and enjoy and love the game of volleyball,\" larsen said. \"it is a game, you know. and we should be enjoying it and loving it, as they did.\"",

        "abstract": "washington the senate has agreed to expand the definition of hate crimes to those committed because of a victim's sexual orientation and gender identity as part of a pentagon policy measure that is becoming a magnet for tough social issues. senators added the anti-bias provisions to the bill thursday night after voting 63 to 28 to shut off debate on the proposal by senator patrick j. leahy , democrat of vermont and chairman of the judiciary committee. the measure would also allow the federal government to intervene in cases where the local authorities lacked the resources for such criminal investigations. \"we need a strong federal law to serve as a backstop to prevent hate-motivated violence in america,\" mr. leahy said. republicans countered that the hate crimes expansion should not be part of a pentagon measure and argued that it would usurp the rights of states to pursue such crimes since most have their own versions of the law. \"federal courts were not created to adjudicate local crimes, no matter how heinous they may be,\" said senator jon kyl , republican of arizona. mr. kyl noted that the killers of matthew shepard, the gay wyoming college student for whom the measure was named, are serving life sentences for murder. but backers of the provisions said that action was overdue on expanding the definition of those affected by legislation that originally was crafted to protect victims of crimes committed on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin. in response to conservative criticism that the legislation could lead to charges against those who speak out against gay rights, mr. leahy added a provision banning prosecution for exercising the rights of free speech. congress has been considering such hate crime legislation for years, but the measure has stalled for various reasons. some house members have recently indicated reluctance to consider the current version, but congressional leaders believe they can find a way to enact it. the senate is scheduled to consider more hate crime provisions on monday. among them is a republican plan to impose the death penalty for certain acts. once they dispose of the hate crime proposals, the senate is set to consider as part of the pentagon bill a republican plan to allow those permitted to carry concealed weapons in one state to take the firearm into other states without violating any laws. it is the latest gun-rights issue to surface in congress. \"a state's border should not be a limit on this fundamental right,\" said senator john thune, republican of south dakota, who is the author of the proposal.",

        "title": "40 years after war, israel weighs remaining risks.",
        "abstract": "jerusalem it was 1 p.m. on saturday, oct. 6, 1973, the day of yom kippur, the holiest in the jewish calendar, and israel's military intelligence chief, maj. gen. eli zeira, had called in the country's top military journalists for an urgent briefing. \"he told us that war would break out at sundown, about 6 p.m.,\" said nachman shai, who was then the military affairs correspondent for israel's public television channel and is now a labor member of parliament. \"forty minutes later he was handed a note and said, 'gentlemen, the war broke out,' and he left the room.\" moments before that note arrived, according to someone else who was at that meeting, general zeira had been carefully peeling almonds in a bowl of ice water. the coordinated attack by egypt and syria, which were bent on regaining strategic territories and pride lost to israel in the 1967 war, surprised and traumatized israel. for months, its leaders misread the signals and wrongly assumed that israel's enemies were not ready to attack. even in those final hours, when the signs were unmistakable that a conflict was imminent, israel was misled by false intelligence about when it would start. as the country's military hurriedly called up its reserves and struggled for days to contain, then repel, the joint assault, a sense of doom spread through the country. many feared a catastrophe. forty years later, israel is again marking yom kippur, which falls on saturday, the anniversary of the 1973 war according to the hebrew calendar. this year the holy day comes in the shadow of new regional tensions and a decision by the united states to opt, at least for now, for a diplomatic agreement rather than a military strike against syria in response to a deadly chemical weapons attack in the damascus suburbs on aug. 21. israeli newspapers and television and radio programs have been filled with recollections of the 1973 war, even as the country's leaders have insisted that the probability of any new israeli entanglement remains low and that the population should carry on as normal. for some people here, though, the echoes of the past have stirred latent questions about the reliability of intelligence assessments and the risks of another surprise attack. \"any israeli with a 40-year perspective will have doubts,\" said mr. shai, who was the military's chief spokesman during the persian gulf war of 1991, when israelis huddled in sealed rooms and donned gas masks, shocked once again as iraqi scud missiles slammed into the heart of tel aviv. coming after the euphoria of israel's victory in the 1967 war, when six days of fighting against the egyptian, jordanian and syrian armies left israel in control of the sinai peninsula, the west bank, gaza, east jerusalem and the golan heights, the conflicts of 1973, 1991 and later years have scarred the national psyche. but several former security officials and analysts said that while the risks now may be similar to those of past years in some respects, there are also major differences. in 1991, for example, the united states responded to the iraqi attack by hastily redeploying some patriot antimissile batteries to israel from europe, but the batteries failed to intercept a single iraqi scud, tracking them instead and following them to the ground with a thud. since then, israel and the united states have invested billions of dollars in israel's air defenses, with the arrow, patriot and iron dome systems now honed to intercept short-, medium- and longer-range rockets and missiles. israelis, conditioned by subsequent conflicts with hezbollah in lebanon and hamas in gaza and by numerous domestic drills, have become accustomed to the wail of sirens and the idea of rocket attacks. but the country is less prepared for a major chemical attack, even though chemical weapons were used across its northern frontier, in syria, less than a month ago, which led to a run on gas masks at distribution centers here. in what some people see as a new sign of government complacency at best and downright failure at worst, officials say there are enough protective kits for only 60 percent of the population, and supplies are dwindling fast. israeli security assessments rate the probability of any attack on israel as low, and the chances of a chemical attack as next to zero. in 1973, the failure of intelligence assessments about egypt and syria was twofold. they misjudged the countries' intentions and miscalculated their military capabilities. \"our coverage human intelligence, signals intelligence and other sorts was second to none,\" said efraim halevy, a former chief of mossad, israel's national intelligence agency. \"we thought we could initially contain any attack or repulse it within a couple of days. we wrongly assessed the capabilities of the egyptians and the syrians. in my opinion, that was the crucial failure.\" israel is in a different situation today, mr. halevy said. the syrian armed forces are depleted and focused on fighting their domestic battles, he said. the egyptian army is busy dealing with its internal turmoil, including a campaign against islamic militants in sinai. hezbollah, the lebanese militant group, is heavily involved in aiding president bashar al-assad of syria, while the iranians, mr. halevy said, are not likely to want to give israel a reason to strike them, \"not as the aggressor but as a victim of an iranian attack.\" israel is also much less likely to suffer such a colossal failure in assessment, mr. halevy said. \"we have plurality in the intelligence community, and people have learned to speak up,\" he said. \"the danger of a mistaken concept is still there, because we are human. but it is much more remote than before.\" many analysts have attributed the failure of 1973 to arrogance. \"there was a disregarding of intelligence,\" said shlomo avineri, a political scientist at hebrew university and a director general of israel's ministry of foreign affairs in the mid-1970s. \"war is a maximization of uncertainties,\" he said, adding that things never happen the same way twice, and that wars never end the way they are expected to. like most countries, israel has been surprised by many events in recent years. the two palestinian uprisings broke out unexpectedly, as did the arab spring and the two revolutions in egypt. \"in 1973, logic said that egypt and syria would not attack, and for good reasons,\" said ephraim kam, a strategic intelligence expert at the institute for national security studies at tel aviv university who served for more than 20 years in military intelligence. \"but there are always things we do not know.\" intelligence is always partial, mr. kam said, its gaps filled by logic and assessment. the problem, he said, is that \"you cannot guarantee that the logic will fit with reality.\" in his recently published diaries from 1973, uzi eilam, a retired general, recalled the sounding of sirens at 2 p.m. on yom kippur and his rushing to the war headquarters. \"eli zeira passed me, pale-faced,\" he wrote, referring to the military intelligence chief, \"and he said: 'so it is starting after all. they are putting up planes.' a fleeting glance told me that this was no longer the eli zeira who was so self-assured.\"",

        "abstract": "as new englanders await a decision in massachusetts on a bitterly contested proposal to build the nation's first offshore wind farm, the state of rhode island is forging ahead with its own project in the hope of outpacing and upstaging its neighbor. crucial to its strategy is dispelling worries that economics will trump the environment, or the broader public good. instead of having a private developer dominate the research on potential sites, as massachusetts has, rhode island embarked on a three-year scientific study , to be completed in august, of all waters within 30 miles of its coast. it has spent more than $8 million on research into bird migration patterns, wildlife habitats, fish distribution, fishermen's needs and areas that might be of cultural importance to indian tribes. its goal has been to head off the hurdles that have been in the way of the massachusetts project, which has pitted coastal indian tribes, business interest and homeowners against the developer, cape wind , and proponents of alternative energy. frustrated by the failure of the two sides to broker an agreement, the obama administration's interior secretary, ken salazar, has promised to determine the fate of the project on his own this month. (on friday a federal historic panel sent mr. salazar its recommendation that the government reject the cape wind project.) \"we took the opposite approach of what cape wind did,\" said grover fugate, the chief administrator of the rhode island project and the director of the state's coastal resources management council. still, independent of the scientific study, rhode island has proposed two potential offshore sites a $200 million eight-turbine project off block island, and a far bigger $1.5 billion farm in the eastern rhode island sound and has selected a preferred developer, deepwater wind . in february, gov. donald l. carcieri went so far as to suggest that the block island site was \"on target to become the nation's first offshore wind farm.\" massachusetts counters that it is much further ahead. \"we've been through all the state permits and we're awaiting the final permits,\" ian bowles, the state's secretary of energy and environment, said in a recent interview. rhode island has not secured permits, but it has trumpeted what cape wind so far lacks: a \"power purchase\" agreement with a utility company to buy what a farm generates. yet on wednesday, the state's utility commission rejected that pact , which involved the proposed farm off block island, as too costly. so for now, cape wind is poised to be first, said matt kaplan, a wind analyst at emerging energy research , a firm that tracks emerging energy markets. \"if cape wind makes it through the permitting process, that is a major feat that no other offshore wind project has achieved in the u.s.,\" he said. \"however, power purchase agreements have been hard to secure.\" officials consider a viable project as a source of energy and jobs, but the wind wars are also driven by state pride. \"there is a rivalry to be the first state to have an offshore wind project in the nation,\" mr. kaplan said. \"and there is some embarrassment on the part of massachusetts, having taken so long with cape wind.\" delaware, maine, new jersey, new york and virginia are also eager to secure permits and to lease blocks from the federal government in waters beyond the three-mile limit of state control. some environmentalists are concerned that the offshore competition in the northeast could trump the protection of fish and bird populations, said jonathan stone, the executive director of save the bay, an advocacy group for narragansett bay. while environmental groups have generally praised rhode island's planning as thorough, some question why state officials homed in on two sites before the three-year study was completed. mr. fugate has emphasized that the sites are tentative and could be vetoed if the research indicates that they have big drawbacks. adjustments have been made as the research has progressed, he said. \"it is a matter of concern, but that's the answer they gave,\" said trisha jedele, a lawyer for the conservation law foundation , an advocacy group. \"and you continue to assess the data and stay vigilant and make sure that ultimately that's what happens in the end.\" the economic stakes are considerable. deepwater, the developer favored by rhode island, says that the wind farm proposed in the sound could generate 1.3 million megawatt hours of energy a year, light up 125,000 homes and create more than 600 jobs. the competition is so heated that rhode island officials have asked researchers to keep some of their results secret. \"i can't talk to some of my former graduate students because they work for the state of massachusetts,\" said john king , a geologist at the university of rhode island who is working on the study. yet in some ways, the scientists are embracing the competition, said scott mcwilliams , a university of rhode island ecologist who has been using radar to plot flight patterns of various birds in an effort to figure out how wind farms might affect migrations and habitats. \"there's definitely a rivalry in getting something in the ground first.\"",

        "title": "2 former new york police officers misused database, u.s. says.",
        "abstract": "in november 2013, joseph p. dwyer, a private investigator who had been retained by a defense lawyer in a bronx murder case, interviewed two eyewitnesses to the killing. but the witnesses' identities, federal authorities say, had appeared only in confidential new york police department reports and had not been provided to anyone other than the prosecution team to protect the witnesses' safety. now federal prosecutors have charged that mr. dwyer, 46, who is often employed by defense lawyers to work on their cases, repeatedly paid off a city police sergeant to have him tap into a confidential law enforcement database to obtain personal information about potential witnesses. the police sergeant, ronald g. buell, 48, who retired this year after more than 25 years with the department, used the database at least 15 times over two years to gain criminal history information and other details pertaining to witnesses and others associated with at least 11 federal prosecutions in new york, according to a federal complaint filed on wednesday. in each of the cases, mr. dwyer, himself a former police officer, had been retained by court-appointed lawyers and was paid with public money, the authorities said. the complaint, filed by the office of preet bharara, the united states attorney for the southern district of new york, does not allege wrongdoing by any lawyers involved in the cases or describe how the information obtained by the two men was used on behalf of defendants. but prosecutors suggested that in the scheme, which they said lasted until last november, the defendants used subterfuge to mask their efforts. in a 2012 case, for example, mr. buell gained access to the database, which is called the national crime information center and is run by the federal bureau of investigation, and obtained personal details about a defendant in another case, the complaint said. the authorities said mr. buell noted in the database's \"user comments\" section that his query \"related to an investigation of home invasion robberies,\" a police investigation that did not exist, according to police investigators. \"private investigators assisting criminal defendants can, and should, do many things to serve their clients,\" mr. bharara said in a statement, \"but bribing law enforcement officials for confidential data is not one of them.\" mr. buell and mr. dwyer were ordered released on bond late on wednesday by a federal magistrate judge in manhattan. each man was charged with one count of participating in a conspiracy to commit bribery and to use a federal database without authorization, and other counts, prosecutors said. mr. dwyer's lawyer, steve zissou, said before his client appeared in court on wednesday, \"every crime requires criminal intent, and there simply wasn't any criminal intent here.\" after the proceeding, mr. buell's lawyer, ronald l. garnett, said he had just entered the case and had no immediate comment. mr. dwyer was one of more than a dozen people who formerly worked in law enforcement who jointly filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a case before the united states supreme court, where justices ruled 5 to 4 last year to make it easier for inmates in certain circumstances to challenge convictions. the brief cited mr. dwyer's work on behalf of william lopez of brooklyn, who had served 23 years in prison for a murder and who last year had his conviction thrown out .",

        "abstract": "hockenheim, germany the german grand prix on sunday marked the halfway point of the 20-race formula one season. while it is far too soon to say who the drivers' champion might be when the season ends in november, fernando alonso, who has so far proven to be the best driver, continued his victorious ways, winning the race in a remarkable way and adding to his series lead. by winning the german grand prix, alonso became the first driver to score three victories this year. he led the race from start to finish in one of his strongest drives of the season. it was the 30th victory of his career and his second victory at the german grand prix in hockenheim, where he also won in 2010, and it was more evidence that alonso, a spaniard driving a ferrari that has not been the best car this season, is at the peak of his talent a week before his 31st birthday. taking advantage of the pole position, which he earned in treacherous, rainy conditions on saturday when faster competitors like the mclaren mercedes and red bull cars performed poorly, alonso controlled the race perfectly, always leading by just enough. \"starting on pole was the key part because it was difficult to overtake,\" alonso said. most important for alonso, the most consistent driver this season, he improved his lead in the drivers' series. alonso leads the series with 154 points. in second is mark webber in the red bull car, with 120 points, while webber's teammate, sebastian vettel is third, with 110. vettel appeared to have finished the race in second position after a dramatic chase in the final laps against jenson button in a mclaren mercedes, who finished third after vettel passed him with three laps left. but two hours after the race it was announced that vettel had made an illegal move in passing button as vettel drove off the edge of the track at the hairpin to get past the mclaren driver, gaining an unfair advantage. vettel was given a 20-second penalty, dropping him to fifth place. kimi raikkonen of the lotus team moved to third place, and button claimed second. the mclarens and red bulls looked like the fastest cars of the weekend, but alonso had scored a faster lap during a difficult, wet qualifying session on saturday. vettel started from second on the grid. button started only sixth. \"definitely it was not an easy race because we were not the quickest on the dry,\" alonso said. \"but we were quite competitive and there were some good calls on strategy by the team.\" although he controlled the race from the beginning, alonso's ferrari this year has frequently run into problems in the final laps of races because the tires wear out more quickly than those of his competitors. on sunday, it looked as if the same problem might occur. the stakes changed with 25 laps left in the 67-lap race when button passed vettel after the german's pit stop to move into second. button had not won a race since the season opener in australia in march, and he was now perched directly behind alonso and apparently in a position to pass. lap after lap, button pressured the ferrari driver. then, however, with just four laps left in the race, button had dropped to 1.9 seconds back as his tires wore out, and now it was he being hunted by vettel, less than a second behind. with less than three laps left, vettel passed button at the hairpin. but he was five seconds behind the leader, and only a breakdown of the ferrari or a mistake by alonso would change the order. alonso held on, as he has in taking advantage of every opportunity this year, winning in malaysia in april thanks to the rain, and winning in valencia, spain, in june thanks to a breakdown of vettel's car. throughout, alonso has avoided making mistakes or losing hope. \"it is true we were o.k. in valencia, but red bull was quickest and we took advantage of a mechanical problem vettel had,\" alonso said. he then pointed out that before the beginning of the season, during testing in jerez, spain, the car had been an enormous two seconds slower than the leading cars. \"i think we have had a good recovery, of when you think where we started in the jerez test,\" he said. \"but it means nothing because there are still another 10 races.\" the hungarian grand prix is sunday, and alonso said it would be tight. \"it's a short circuit and as we saw this year, in two or three tenths there are eight or nine cars,\" alonso said. \"so we need to make a perfect preparation and a perfect qualifying, because you can be out of the top 10 if you miss a couple of tenths.\"",

        "abstract": "new haven as former gov. john g. rowland of connecticut politely observes the proceedings from his front-row seat, the gloves have been coming off all week here at his federal trial on corruption charges, with both sides trying to tie up loose ends before the closing arguments on thursday. this is the second time a case captioned \"u.s.a. v. john g. rowland\" has been tried in the federal courthouse here. the last time, a decade ago, mr. rowland, a republican who had resigned the governorship in disgrace, pleaded guilty to a felony and served 10 months in prison. this time, he has made it clear that he will not go quietly. six of the seven counts he is being charged with concern services he provided lisa wilson-foley, a republican candidate for congress in 2012, and her husband, brian j. foley , who owns the apple rehab nursing home chain. one count involves a proposal mr. rowland is accused of offering another republican candidate for congress in 2010, mark greenberg, which was never carried out, that would have routed mr. rowland's fees for advising the campaign through mr. greenberg's animal shelter. he spurned pretrial offers that he plead guilty to misdemeanors and chose instead to go to trial. represented by a phalanx of washington lawyers headed by reid h. weingarten, he could face up to 57 years in prison if he is found guilty. his lawyers have succeeded in keeping some damaging information out of the record that might have influenced the jury, including testimony by an employee of ms. wilson-foley's 2012 campaign that the first campaign manager told colleagues they would all go to jail if they continued to work there. the defense has also pushed to impeach mr. foley , whose testimony of an illegal conspiracy has been the linchpin of the case. he testified early in the trial as part of a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that accompanied guilty pleas he and his wife signed in march. their pleas acknowledged entering into a conspiracy with mr. rowland to keep his involvement in her campaign out of regulatory reports to avoid possible voter disapproval. at mr. rowland's trial, mr. foley testified that the $5,000 a month he was paying mr. rowland, ostensibly for consulting work through apple rehab's law firm, was actually for assistance mr. rowland was giving ms. wilson-foley with her 2012 congressional bid. in its effort to impeach mr. foley, the defense team leaned heavily on its one witness, brian bedard, mr. foley's chief operating officer at apple rehab. the voluble mr. bedard testified that mr. rowland tackled real assignments at apple, produced at least two written reports, attended meetings and otherwise weighed in on policy issues vital to the nursing home operator. mr. bedard, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, was easily flustered on the stand and contradicted himself often. the prosecutors chiseled away at his credibility and motives. pushed by mr. weingarten, the presiding judge, janet bond arterton of united states district court, allowed the defense to recall mr. bedard to give him a chance to clarify remarks concerning his interactions with mr. foley, but only after advising the dueling legal teams, outside the earshot of the jury, that the witness's multiple accounts of that had created quite \"a mess.\" \"every time he says what he claims mr. foley said, he changes,\" she told the lawyers, somewhat astonished. asked anew about what mr. foley had told mr. bedard after the foleys signed guilty pleas with the united states attorney's office in march, mr. bedard said that mr. foley had maintained to him that \"there was no deal\" or \"quid pro quo\" with mr. rowland. liam brennan, one of the prosecutors, then elicited testimony from mr. bedard that he nonetheless understood mr. foley to mean that the deal with mr. rowland was a \"sham,\" even if the unspoken arrangement was never detailed on paper. when mr. bedard's dizzying turn in the witness stand finally came to an end, judge arterton turned to him and said he was free to step down. \"walk, don't run,\" she advised.",

        "abstract": "washington president obama is likely to declare on tuesday evening that the state of the union is strong. that word, strong, has become a ritual element of the annual address to congress, intoned by mr. obama and his predecessors over the last 30 years even when things were not going that well. \"the state of our union has never been stronger,\" president george w. bush said in january 2002 , immediately after reminding congress that the nation was at war and the economy was in recession. \"despite our hardships, our union is strong,\" mr. obama said in january 2010 , after mentioning that the nation was engaged in two wars and that the economy had fallen into an even deeper recession. strong, stronger, strongest one of those words has been used to describe the union in each of the last 17 state of the union addresses. but it was not always so. presidents once used other words to describe the state of our union. president jimmy carter liked to call it \"sound.\" president harry s. truman liked to call it \"good.\" president lyndon b. johnson, in a lyrical moment, described the state of the union in 1965 as \"free and restless, growing and full of hope.\" and when things were not going well, they said so. \"i must say to you that the state of the union is not good,\" president gerald r. ford said in 1975 , citing high unemployment, slow growth and soaring deficits. he added, \"i've got bad news, and i don't expect much, if any, applause.\" in 1961, president john f. kennedy said , \"the present state of our economy is disturbing,\" declaring that he spoke in \"an hour of national peril and national opportunity.\" no president has ever delivered a more dour assessment than andrew johnson in 1867 , as the nation wrestled with the reconstruction of the southern states: \"candor compels me to declare that at this time there is no union as our fathers understood the term, and as they meant it to be understood by us.\" image \"the state of our union is strong,\" president bill clinton said in his address to congress in 1999. and in 1996, 1997 and 1998. credit win mcnamee/reuters what changed? the simple answer is president ronald reagan. reagan's first official state of the union address, in 1982, was among the bleaker assessments a president has delivered, although it was framed with his trademark optimism. the state of the union, he declared, would be getting better. the following year, he said that it had . \"as we gather here tonight,\" reagan told congress, \"the state of our union is strong.\" anthony r. dolan, reagan's chief speechwriter, said that he could not recall who suggested the word \"strong,\" but that it was a better choice than \"good\" or \"sound\" because \"it had just a little bit of a moral quality.\" mr. dolan said he also liked the word because it was \"qualitative rather than quantitative\" the union could be strong even if the economy was not. reagan used the same word, though never in exactly the same way, in several subsequent years. but it was president bill clinton who made the phrase a modern standard, declaring that \"the state of our union is strong\" in each annual address from 1996 to 1999. by january 2000 , when the economy was booming, he jettisoned all understatement and grandly pronounced, \"my fellow americans, the state of our union is stronger than it has ever been.\" david kusnet, mr. clinton's chief speechwriter during his early years in the white house, said that he did not recall the decision to use the phrase, but that it was easy to imagine why the choice was made, and repeated, and repeated. \"strong is a tempting word,\" mr. kusnet said. \"it's simple, declarative. it's alliterative. and it had the added benefit of being accurate.\" he said he saw the phrase as a modern version of president franklin d. roosevelt's formulation that the nation was stronger than its problems. \"since f.d.r., the essence of presidential rhetoric is summoning our national strength to address our national challenges,\" said mr. kusnet, a principal at the podesta group. mr. bush also used \"strong\" and its variants in each of his seven state of the union addresses. matthew n. latimer, a speechwriter in mr. bush's second term, said that in his recollection no one ever proposed a different adjective. \"if presidents before you said that the state of the union is strong, you say that it's strong,\" said mr. latimer, who now runs javelin, a ghostwriting firm. \"otherwise someone is going to say, 'why didn't he say that the country is still strong?' \" of course, there are risks in such perpetual optimism. consider the case of president herbert hoover, who said in 1928 , the last year before the stock market crash ushered in the great depression, \"no congress of the united states ever assembled, on surveying the state of the union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time.\" perhaps it would be safer to emulate president benjamin harrison, who in 1889 wrote to congress as presidents did throughout the 19th century that there was no need for the president to describe the state of the union because \"every step taken is under the observation of an intelligent and watchful people.\"",

        "title": "jeb bush begins wooing donors for a 2016 bid.",
        "abstract": "jeb bush on tuesday delivered a powerful message about two of the most vital ingredients in a presidential campaign, money and ideas, transforming himself from a figure who once seemed paralyzed by ambivalence over a white house run into the most forceful presence within the emerging republican field. with the flip of a facebook switch, mr. bush, the former governor of florida, disclosed the formation of a full-time political apparatus that can begin raising money with an eye toward 2016 and laid out a campaign rationale that was striking for its emphasis on big, knotty, bipartisan concepts like immigration overhaul and income inequality. mr. bush, 61, a figure indelibly linked to the republican party's past, seems determined to offer himself as an intellectual midwife of its future a break from the party's struggle to win over minority voters and the kind of ideological infighting, on display tuesday when conservatives tried to oust speaker john a. boehner, that mr. bush could face in primaries. \"we will not cede an inch of territory no issues, no demographic groups, no voters,\" he wrote in a statement on the website of his new organization, called right to rise . to emphasize the point, and showcase his social media savvy, mr. bush appeared on a cellphone video tuesday speaking both english and spanish. in the process, he is employing a well-worn playbook of early, aggressive and high-profile maneuvers to deflect attention and resources from his potential rivals, who have remained largely quiet over the past few weeks as the son and brother of presidents commanded the spotlight. \"what it is designed to do is provide first-mover advantage to a strong player with the objective of sucking as much oxygen out of the room as you possibly can,\" said dirk van dongen, president of the national association of wholesaler-distributors, who is supporting mr. bush and was a prominent contributor to the campaigns of his brother, former president george w. bush. but the tactics carry genuine risk: mr. bush, who told friends that he was in no hurry to enter a presidential contest that is still two years off, is now placing himself directly in the cross hairs of both republicans and democrats who view him as a threat. as mr. bush announced right to rise, a group tied to senator rand paul, republican of kentucky, bought ads on google that would direct anyone searching for information about mr. bush to a web page about mr. paul. and in a sign of how quickly, and inadvertently, messages can be muddled, mr. bush posted the video of himself speaking in front of blackrock, a wall street investment firm, on a day when he was trying to highlight the plight of the middle class. social media lit up with unflattering references to the juxtaposition. in tone and content, mr. bush's message stood out from the white-hot, partisan rhetoric of would-be rivals like senator ted cruz, republican of texas. mr. bush wrote that \"we are optimists,\" declared that \"the income gap is real\" and reached out to the poor who \"have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp.\" it was a sentiment echoed in his sympathetic remarks on monday urging respect for same-sex marriage in florida . rick wilson, a political consultant in florida who has advised presidential campaigns, said he was struck by the absence of any animus from mr. bush toward president obama. \"i think he rightly believes most of the candidates will find themselves as the anti-obama, the cure, the rollback,\" mr. wilson said. \"he's going to position himself as the guy with bigger ideas and a broader vision.\" even as mr. bush sought to broaden the appeal of his party, he also tended to its traditional constituencies. in his blueprint, mr. bush deployed the lexicon of grass-roots conservatism, sketching out an economic vision that rewards \"merit, hard work and earned success,\" not government handouts. the 2016 presidential race is still in a nascent phase, but the competition for major donors, a contest all but invisible to the public, has begun in earnest. the early moves by mr. bush appear designed to roil that unseen financial primary, by unsettling both his would-be competitors, most of whom do not have the resources or support to begin campaigning so early, and republican donors. until now, with no entity to which they could actually write checks, the bulk of the party's top donors and fund-raisers outside mr. bush's inner circle of financial backers could remain safely on the sidelines. that changed abruptly on tuesday with the announcement of mr. bush's pac, which can accept individual contributions of several thousand dollars, and amid indications that he is preparing to file papers for a new \"super pac\" that can accept unlimited contributions. the name of his pac, right to rise, is taken from a phrase popularized by representative paul d. ryan, republican of wisconsin, conveying a right to social mobility. \"i think there are some people that are sitting back, and if jeb runs, they're not going to run,\" said andy sabin, a new york businessman who is a big donor to national republican candidates and party organizations. he added: \"i don't feel like we have a great field of uniters. jeb knows he has to bring left and right together.\" mr. bush and his top supporters already have begun to press contributors to make financial and fund-raising commitments to the two new entities, which can cover the costs of staff, travel and even advertising in support of the former governor's political endeavors. several fund-raising events are planned for washington in the coming days, and in manhattan mr. bush will hold a meeting at the powerhouse private equity firm kkr. \"there are phone calls going out to people like myself right now, from people who know him,\" said richard f. hohlt, a lobbyist who has raised money for many republican white house campaigns. their message: \"can you help jeb?\" so far, mr. hohlt said, a lot people are saying yes. \"i think he will find a lot of financial support.\"",

        "title": "in china, traffic jam is windfall for enterprising villagers.",
        "abstract": "hetaocun, china compared with some of the more spectacular recent traffic jams in china , among them a 60-mile snarl last summer that paralyzed a major artery outside beijing for two weeks, the thousands of travelers who spent the night trapped on a snow-coated highway in southwest guizhou province on monday did not even warrant a mention in the local news media. the immediate effect of the information vacuum was to suck more unwitting victims including this reporter into the morass, which stretched for miles along the four-lane affair linking guizhou north to chongqing . stranded drivers chain-smoked, stomped their feet against the chill and cursed the government for failing to come to their rescue. as the night wore on, fuel lines froze and cellphone batteries died. the residents of hetaocun, however, saw the unmoving necklace of taillights from their mountain village and got entrepreneurial. they roused children from their beds, loaded boxes of instant noodles into baskets and began hawking their staples to a captive clientele. the 500 percent markup did not appear to dent sales. \"it rarely snows here, so this is a good thing,\" said yi zhonggui, 42, as he wove past stalled vehicles with his wife and 4-year-old daughter lugging thermoses of hot water. as the supply of noodles ran low, residents began gathering up the walnuts that give the village its name. in between cries of \"walnuts, walnuts,\" salesmen like chen xianneng obliged the desperate with snippets of news from the front, even if the information was based on hearsay. \"the roadway is frozen, and the trucks can't get down the hill,\" he would say, cracking shells open with his bare hands as a sort of sales pitch. (later, it became apparent that an overturned truck carrying toilets was largely responsible for the mess.) by noon on tuesday, more than 12 hours after the blockage began, the frustration and anxiety were mounting. truckloads of oranges were going bad, and xi xinli was nervously eyeing his cargo of 30 hogs, a noisome pile of pink complaining flesh that was bound for the slaughterhouse. \"you would be annoyed, too, if you were stuck together like that without food or water,\" mr. xi said. people were faring no better, especially the busloads of migrant workers who had endured clotted roadways for as long as three days. one especially unlucky bunch left guangdong province on saturday only to find themselves stuck on their bus for eight hours when an earlier bout of freezing rain crippled a portion of southern china. \"i'm hungry, but the food they're selling is too expensive, and i'm tired but too cold to sleep,\" said zhao ling, 25, a carpenter trying to return home to chengdu, the provincial capital of sichuan. mr. zhao and his fellow passengers thought they were smart by traveling before the chinese new year's crush, which starts in earnest next week. in 2008, the last time unusually snowy weather buried china's southern flank, more than six million people were stranded as they tried to make their way home for the new year's holiday. that crisis prompted a national debate about the government's ability to deal with weather-related calamities and led to a rare, well-publicized apology from prime minister wen jiabao. if the past few weeks are any indication, the coming holiday may be no better. much of the region has been battered by unusually cold weather, and earlier this month, a storm shut down most of guizhou's highways, including the road to guangzhou, where thousands were stuck for four days. according to local news reports, the government eventually mobilized with emergency food and water, and gave each trapped passenger 100 renminbi, or about $15. mr. zhao and the others would not be so lucky. as the hours passed, he fidgeted in his seat and wondered whether the traffic police would ever show up. \"maybe they all went home early for the holiday,\" he said with a smirk. moments later came a cascade of shouts, followed by the honking of horns and then the coughing of starting engines that became contagious. as people scurried back into their vehicles, the bedraggled, frozen column began to creep forward, slowly at first, but then with more resolve. the hawkers from hetaocun stepped back onto the highway shoulder, their expressions forlorn. but then the snow began to fall again and mr. yi, the farmer-turned-noodle vendor, began to smile. he repeated the weather forecast he had heard that morning several more days of freezing precipitation and told his wife to stay put. \"don't worry,\" he said. \"they'll get stuck again.\"",

        "abstract": "in a six-day nationwide sweep, federal immigration agents arrested 3,168 immigrants who had been convicted of crimes or had repeatedly violated immigration laws, officials said monday. the operation by immigration and customs enforcement involved arrests in all 50 states and was coordinated with the local and state police, in the largest arrest campaign by the agency, officials said. among those detained were 1,477 immigrants who had served prison sentences for felonies, and 1,063 immigrants with more than one criminal conviction, the agency reported. those arrested also included 559 immigrants who had returned to the united states illegally after being deported. john morton, the director of immigration and customs enforcement, said the operation was an example of the agency's shift in focus, to deporting immigrants in the country illegally who also have been convicted of crimes or who \"game the immigration system.\" the agency has also been pursuing a program intended to halt deportations of some illegal immigrants without criminal records, by exercising prosecutorial discretion to close their cases in immigration courts. the former felons arrested in the sweep had been released from prison in past years before immigration agents were able to hold them for deportation. \"we are addressing the backlog of people here unlawfully who were released to the streets because we weren't able to respond in time,\" mr. morton said. the operation was carried out by agents from the deportation unit of the agency, which is known as ice. the union representing those agents, council 118 of the american federation of government employees, has been in a protracted standoff with top officials over how to carry out the policy redirecting deportations toward criminals and sparing other illegal immigrants. the arrests, mr. morton said, showed that the dispute has not hampered the agents' work. \"it's hard to say that these issues have affected our performance or results as an agency,\" he said.",

        "title": "wright county egg's founder apologizes for salmonella.",
        "abstract": "washington an iowa egg producer at the center of a nationwide outbreak of salmonella apologized to a congressional panel on wednesday and acknowledged that his family operation had become \"big quite awhile before we stopped acting like we were small.\" \"what i mean by that is, we were big before we started adopting sophisticated procedures to be sure we met all of the government requirements,\" the egg producer, austin j. decoster , said in testimony before a house energy and commerce subcommittee. he is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked over three decades to outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in many states, some leading to deaths. \"we were horrified to learn that our eggs may have made people sick,\" mr. decoster, who is known as jack, said in a shaky voice. \"we apologize to everyone who may have been sickened by eating our eggs.\" his company, wright county egg, based in iowa, and another company, hillandale farms, recalled more than 500 million eggs last month after health officials traced salmonella bacteria that sickened more than 1,500 people to those companies. a subsequent inspection by the food and drug administration found that the barns of the egg producers were infested with flies, maggots and rodents, and had overflowing manure pits. records unearthed by congressional investigators showed that tests of wright county egg barns had shown the presence of toxic salmonella bacteria for years before the outbreak. despite such conditions, peter decoster, austin decoster's son and the chief operating officer of wright county egg, told the panel that the most likely source of the contamination was a separate company that supplied ingredients for chicken feed, a contention disputed by federal food officials. he said that some of the filthy conditions documented by the f.d.a. were standard practice in the industry. documents released by the committee showed that wright county egg achieved a \"superior\" rating and \"recognition of achievement\" from aib international, a private inspection company based in manhattan, kan., after a june inspection of its processing facility. that came just as the company was causing thousands of illnesses from contaminated eggs . in 2008, aib gave a \"superior\" rating to a peanut corporation of america plant in blakely, ga., that was later found to be riddled with salmonella that caused a nationwide outbreak and the largest food recall in american history. a spokesman for aib could not be reached. orland bethel, the president of hillandale farms of iowa and a longtime associate of the decosters, cited his fifth amendment rights and declined to testify. but in an aug. 31 e-mail released by the subcommittee, mr. bethel wrote, \"hillandale needs to totally disassociate itself from jack and it needs to be real. hillandale has a good business base, but it will all be gone if i don't move quickly and i will not try to deceive the public.\" in another e-mail, mr. bethel wrote that his company had been told by costco and wal-mart \"that they will not be doing any business if jack and his people have any involvement in management or ownership.\" duane mangskau, a hillandale production manager, told the committee that hillandale had ended its marketing relationship with wright county egg. representative bruce braley, a democrat of iowa, asked austin decoster, \"how is it possible that after all this time we have another decoster egg facility involved in a half-billion egg recall?\" mr. decoster responded, \"the question is complicated, sir.\" pictures taken at the decoster facilities of barns bursting with manure, manure flowing under barn doors, and barns with dead rodents, chickens and flies were shown at the hearing. members of the panel expressed outrage that inspectors found such conditions even though the decosters were alerted days before inspectors appeared that the company's eggs had been contaminated. \"decoster farms have had warning after warning\" for decades, said representative henry a. waxman, a california democrat. \"yet they continue to raise chickens in slovenly conditions and to make millions of dollars by selling contaminated eggs.\" the hearing was briefly interrupted by two animal welfare advocates who unfurled an anti-egg banner and repeatedly chanted: \"all eggs kill!\" police officers escorted them from the room. dr. joshua m. sharfstein, the f.d.a.'s principal deputy commissioner, told the panel that the f.d.a. needed new powers and money to help prevent further food contamination outbreaks, both of which are provided for in legislation that the house passed last year but that has been languishing in the senate. \"we need this bill to help protect the safety of the food supply,\" he said. democratic members of the panel denounced senator tom coburn, a republican from oklahoma, who has objected to a democratic plan to bring food safety legislation to a vote. \"this is a public health imperative,\" said representative edward j. markey, a democrat from massachusetts. \"there must be some exceptions for republicans in the senate. they must release this bill so that we can protect millions of families.\" but representative michael c. burgess, republican of texas, said that mr. coburn's objections had not prevented the bill from being considered by the senate. mr. burgess sought to read a statement from mr. coburn at the hearing, but representative bart stupak, the chairman of the panel, cut off his microphone, which led to a sharp exchange between the lawmakers. \"i voted with you on the dang bill. i've worked with you on the dang bill,\" mr. burgess said. \"it is preposterous that the majority has conducted the hearing this way when he's not the problem.\" and then, referring to mr. coburn, mr. burgess added, \"he may become a problem if the majority leader brings it to the floor,\" a remark that elicited laughter from the room. hours after the hearing, senator harry reid, democrat of nevada and the senate majority leader, asked on the senate floor for the unanimous consent for the body to consider the bill. \"there is no excuse to wait any longer,\" he said. \"our current food safety system hasn't been updated in almost a century.\" but mr. coburn objected. to overcome mr. coburn's objections, mr. reid would have to file for cloture, a process that can take a week or more; the senate has other legislation it must pass before members adjourn to campaign in october. \"on a piece of legislation that is this bipartisan, this should be something we can do rather quickly,\" said regan lachapelle, a spokeswoman for mr. reid. \"unfortunately, one senator is saying no.\"",

        "abstract": "columbia, tenn. the domed courthouse clock tower tolls the hour, but not much else breaks the stillness in this centuries-old county seat where politics seems to have reached equilibrium, balanced between ancient democratic traditions and newer republican ones. beneath the surface peace, though, in the storefronts, diners and offices around the square, there is unease as tuesday's primaries approach. a prosperity that has endowed this city of 34,000 with fancy antiques stores and well-appointed personal investment offices is weakening. unemployment in maury county is rising as a nearby auto plant declines, unfamiliar candidates are on the ballot and all the history accumulated here over two centuries, in the middle of a politically middling state, is proving to be an unreliable guide. in november, democrats need to win here in this swing county in the hilly nashville exurbia, just as they need to win in the rest of tennessee and in its neighbor arkansas, southern states that have voted for the winner in the last eight presidential elections. but the choices available in the coming democratic primary have led to disquiet among independent voters, democratic-leaning republicans and even some traditional democrats, according to interviews here and across the state line in arkansas. these states are among four in the south voting in primary elections on tuesday (the others are alabama and georgia) in a region that went solidly for president bush in the last two elections but where democrats hope to make inroads this november, capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the republicans. that hope may be unrealistic, even in the crucial swing states. \"i wish there was somebody worth voting for,\" said buford moss, a retired union carbide worker sitting at the back table of bucky's family restaurant here, with a group of regulars, in a county seat that as the home of the 11th president, james k. polk is one of the ancestral homelands of jacksonian democracy. \"the democrats have left the working people,\" mr. moss said. \"we have nobody representing us,\" he continued, adding that he was \"sad to say\" he had voted previously for mr. bush. he was considering sitting out this election altogether. \"anyone but obama-osama,\" he said, chuckling at a designation that met with mirthful approval at the table. in interviews around the courthouse square, voters stuttered over senators hillary rodham clinton and barack obama in matchups with republicans, particularly senator john mccain, whose military credentials give him solid regional armoring. some white voters voiced outright alarm over mr. obama, and though he is a christian, allusions to his supposed muslim ties were frequent, as were suggestions that he remained a disturbingly unknown quantity. white men, in particular, expressed general fearfulness over a possible terrorist attack, over an unnamed threat from muslims, over hispanic immigrants and over the weakening economy. these fears led them to reflect positively on republican candidates, perceived as more hard-line on most fronts. \"i think our greatest fear is our terrorist enemies,\" said waymon l. hickman, senior chairman of first farmers & merchants bank, whose headquarters building dominates main street here. \"you get peloski up there and they say we've lost the war, and that just fuels our adversaries,\" said mr. hickman, incorrectly pronouncing the name of speaker nancy pelosi. he described himself as an \"independent\" voter but said he could not envision voting democratic unless it was for a centrist like gov. phil bredesen of tennessee. as for mr. obama, \"he's got to say the things he's saying, to win the primary,\" mr. hickman said, expressing disdain. mr. obama may fare well in primaries in alabama and georgia, where blacks make up roughly a quarter of the overall voting population and perhaps twice that percentage in the democratic primary electorate, but even if he does, it is unclear how meaningful primary victories in these states would be in november. the voters in tennessee and arkansas are already looking past next month's low-profile primary contests and ahead to the general-election matchup, which many said they were anticipating with keen interest because of the pressing issues of the declining economy and the war and, in some cases, anger at mr. bush. the candidates and their campaigns, devoted to larger delegate prizes elsewhere, were nearly invisible in the region until after the south carolina democratic primary last saturday. even in arkansas, where mrs. clinton lived for nearly two decades, her headquarters is an inconspicuous storefront at the edge of downtown little rock, though she is expected to visit the state this week. still, with a nod to the importance of these states that remain so difficult yet so vital for democrats, mrs. clinton campaigned in tennessee on sunday, immediately after the south carolina primary, and mr. obama flew to birmingham, ala. beyond super tuesday, there may be trouble for the democrats. swing voters perceive both front-runners as too liberal, though mrs. clinton has support in arkansas because her husband remains popular. but here in maury county, which has voted democratic and republican in the last three decades, none expressed enthusiasm for mrs. clinton. similar unease was voiced in yell county, ark., another place that has swung back and forth, where some were quick to say that mr. obama's race was not prohibitive for them personally but could well be for others. only john edwards, a fellow southerner but now considered an also-ran, met with broad approval from independents who were interviewed in the tennessee county; in arkansas, mrs. clinton's most ardent supporters in the undulating \"free state of yell\" so called because of a history of electoral eccentricity conceded that they knew plenty who were just as sharply opposed to her candidacy. former bush voters disillusioned with the president said flatly they would not vote for mr. obama, while others expressed disappointment with the available choices. meanwhile, republicans, even those critical of mr. bush, said that the too-liberal democratic choices left them more solidly than ever with their party, though none voiced great enthusiasm for the field. \"ain't none of the republicans got me jumping up and down,\" said ken sumner, 58, who manages ken's river view cafe in high falls, ga. \"mccain, i think he's a good man. i think he means good. i really don't know if he has the energy to be president.\" political professionals in the border states of the south are skeptical about democratic prospects this year, without being completely dismissive. \"does a democratic candidate have any kind of shot?\" asked bruce oppenheimer, a political scientist at vanderbilt university in nashville. tennessee \"potentially could be in play,\" mr. oppenheimer said, \"but a lot of other states might come before it.\" arkansas \"will stay on the charts longer for her,\" said jay barth of hendrix college in conway, referring to mrs. clinton, but he added that \"the odds are not with\" her in a matchup with mr. mccain. in yell county, in the foothills of the ouachita mountains, a place so ornery that tombstones and bird dogs were once said to have taken part in elections, a number of residents said local voters would probably support mrs. clinton former president bill clinton is said to have relatives in the county unless she were matched against mr. mccain. mention of mr. obama merely provoked discomfort. \"statements i've heard, obama, they're seriously afraid of him,\" said bobby rollans, a retired teacher, sitting at savanna's, a restaurant perched on the arkansas river. bill mashek, a retired national guard officer, said, \"i've talked to some yellow-dog democrats; they won't vote for obama.\" ominously for democrats, perhaps, even longtime republican voters dissatisfied with their party are nonetheless still stuck on the fence. \"this is the first election that i am more seriously wearing that independent sign,\" said charlotte battles, the director emeritus of a boarding school in columbia for children with developmental disabilities. \"this year, i think there is a feeling of a need for change,\" ms. battles said, \"whether that's a democrat, or a republican.\"",

        "title": "with transit chairmanship, fernando ferrer slips back onstage.",
        "abstract": "the answer was obvious even before the question was posed, but we felt like asking anyway. given reports that michael r. bloomberg has been shopping around for someone he'd like to anoint as the next mayor, is it possible that fernando ferrer got a call? mr. ferrer smiled. it was a half-smile, one registering both amusement and bemusement. \"i mean, if i were he, supposedly a fully grown adult, i'd be embarrassed by it,\" he said of the bloomberg search for a designated successor. \"leave it at that.\" fact is, he said the other day over breakfast at a bronx diner, his last conversation with the mayor was quite a while back. mr. bloomberg had tried to recruit him to take part in a lighthearted video for the annual inner circle dinner, where reporters and politicians trade jabs. \"i took a pass,\" he said. so freddy ferrer, to use the nickname he has had since boyhood, won't be new york's mayor. but you knew that. not that he hasn't reached for the brass ring; he ran three mayoral campaigns of varying intensity. the last time out, in 2005, mr. bloomberg beat him soundly. that, it seemed, was that, for him and public service. he'd go off to a consulting group, sit on a few company boards, enjoy his three grandchildren, work on his tennis game, maybe reflect on his years as a city councilman and bronx borough president. a comfortable life, one that does not require him to speculate, despite urging from his tablemate, on how the city might have been different these last years under a mayor ferrer. \"i think you get your chance in the context of an election to make your case,\" he said. \"you fail to make it? done. accept the verdict and move on.\" but life can take funny bounces. freddy ferrer is back. a year and a half ago, gov. andrew m. cuomo put him on the board of the metropolitan transportation authority . then he was made the authority's vice chairman. now, almost out of nowhere, he has ascended to the chairmanship, as visible a position as we have in this city. true, he is only acting chairman, until the governor finds a permanent replacement for joseph j. lhota, who left to contemplate a mayoral race of his own . so mr. ferrer, who turns 63 in april, will not stay at the top for long. \"yeah, but it's nice to be the chair,\" he said, \"because you can ask questions and get quick answers. if you'd like to ask a very drill-down-deep question about service or about a project, you get a really detailed answer. and you can have some impact on policy.\" his unexpected re-emergence prompted curiosity about second acts in new york public life. and that led, at his suggestion, to the tibbett diner, which still had its christmas lights up, with candy canes dangling from the wires. the diner sits on tibbett avenue, sandwiched between a carwash and an auto repair shop along an ill-defined line that separates the bronx neighborhoods of spuyten duyvil, where he lives, and kingsbridge. the street may most politely be described as unprepossessing. \"i don't need a menu,\" mr. ferrer said to the waitress. by now, he practically has it memorized. \"he's a regular,\" the waitress said. indeed, he started coming here in the late 1970s with his wife, aramina. but on this morning he didn't mingle much with the other diners, settling into a corner booth. he ordered tomato juice, an onion-and-swiss-cheese omelet with a side of tomatoes hold the potatoes buttered rye toast and coffee. got to have coffee, mr. ferrer said. image fernando ferrer, the acting chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority and former mayoral candidate and bronx borough president, sat down for breakfast at the tibbett diner in the bronx. credit ozier muhammad/the new york times \"breakfast of champions,\" mr. ferrer said when his food arrived. he ended up leaving it half-eaten, though. all right, second acts: how did this one come about? why even bother at this stage? \"look,\" a lot of his sentences begin with \"look\" \"i'm very happy with my life,\" he said. \"look, if in your dna there's a couple of public-service genes, they don't go away. public service was always very satisfying. if you can get some good things done and help some people, why else would you want to do this?\" his path to the transportation board began with a phone call from representative nydia m. velazquez , one of five leaders of the transition team for the newly elected governor cuomo. she asked if mr. ferrer wanted to join the administration. \"i appreciate it, very flattering, no thanks,\" he replied. \"she said, 'well, then, how about the m.t.a. board?' i'd been recruited by former governor spitzer to be on the s.u.n.y. board of trustees, but that was the weekend before he imploded. so i was happy to see that nomination go. but the m.t.a. board was intriguing.\" \"friends of mine have accused me of needing to run a small country,\" he said. in its own way, that's what the transit system is. this breakfast was not about specific transit policies. still, it was impossible to resist asking if he had any pet peeves as a regular on the no. 1 subway line and on metro-north. naturally, he did. is he not a new yorker? his complaints tended, however, to be about other riders, not transit managers. like this one: \"people who eat full-blown meals on the subway that drives me up the wall. i can't stand it. hey, look, a muffin, a candy bar, a cup of coffee? i get that. a meal with noodles? i'm sorry.\" fair enough. \"you didn't ask me what i like,\" he said later, in a mild rebuke. all right, we'll bite. \"it's affordable,\" he said. \"it's safe. it's clean mostly. and it's reliable.\" some would give him an argument on those points but, again, this meal was not about policy. let's talk instead about facial hair. for years, mr. ferrer had a mustache, a feature that made him instantly recognizable. then he shaved it. now he has a full beard, which we have to say looks an awful lot like mr. lhota's. \"i saw joe last week,\" mr. ferrer said, \"and he said, 'what, every m.t.a. chairman has to have a beard now?' i said, 'no, i'm hiding out. people will think i'm you.' \" if he has a regret, it is that this new position came about only a few weeks after the death of his mother, susan. \"she'd have gotten a kick out of seeing this m.t.a. thing,\" he said. he grew up in the south bronx, reared by his mother and his grandmother, inocencia. when he was running for mayor, he used to talk about his roots, and how his grandmother had toiled in the kitchen of the waldorf-astoria hotel. the evening before this breakfast, he happened to be at the waldorf, for an andrew cuomo birthday party cum fund-raiser. it brought him back to when he was a grand marshal in the puerto rican day parade, in 1993, a year before his grandmother died. \"i'm really glad she lived to see that,\" he said. \"the grand marshal's breakfast was always at the marriott. i changed it that year to the starlight roof of the waldorf, and then i let people know that morning why.\" that one was for inocencia.",

        "title": "i.r.s. scrutiny of big firms plummets, study says.",
        "abstract": "most americans dread tax season. but corporate america seems to have less to fear from the internal revenue service than it used to, according to a new study. the i.r.s.'s scrutiny of the nation's biggest companies is at a 20-year low, according to the study, conducted by transactional records access clearinghouse, or trac, a research group affiliated with syracuse university . the study, made public sunday, points to \"a historic collapse in audits.\" it found that major corporations defined as those with assets of at least $250 million have about a one in four chance of being audited, down from about three in four in 1990. for americans with incomes above $100,000, the chances of being audited in 2006 were 1 in 59. above $1 million, the odds increased to 1 in 16. the study's findings stand in sharp contrast to the tough talk coming out of the i.r.s. in recent years. the report suggests that the agency is shifting its focus away from big corporations to smaller companies, private partnerships and other private entities, a move that tax lawyers said was consistent with trends they were seeing. but i.r.s. officials, who reviewed the report before its release, said friday that trac had misinterpreted a basic shift in corporate america in recent years. companies of all sizes, as well as wealthy individuals, have embraced the use of partnerships and other opaque entities in an effort to minimize taxes, the officials said. sometimes those arrangements cross the line into tax abuse; enron used hundreds of them to commit fraud. because large companies increasingly use such partnerships, the i.r.s. has stepped up scrutiny of these entities. \"these aren't mom-and-pop grocery stores we're auditing,\" said barry shott, a deputy i.r.s. commissioner. the i.r.s. has not reduced its scrutiny of large corporations, he said. instead, it is focusing on the private partnerships some of these companies use to avoid paying taxes. mr. shott said that the i.r.s. supplied data to trac but that the group, which gathers information from government agencies under the freedom of information act, had misinterpreted it. trac, which has gone to court to force the i.rs. to turn over more detailed data on audits, stood by its findings. while the report singled out the i.r.s.'s increased focus on partnerships, it also said that the agency was increasingly focusing on smaller corporations, or those with less than $50 million in assets. such companies require less time and money to investigate and the i.r.s. has long complained that it is underfunded. such investigations, however, typically bring in fewer unpaid tax dollars than audits of large corporations. the focus on smaller companies upset some tax professionals. \"i'm still trying to find my jaw on the ground from the finding that audit rates for the big boys are plummeting,\" said dean zerbe, the national managing director of alliant group, a tax planning company. while corporations account for a small percentage of all taxes paid to federal coffers, their share of the total has been rising in recent years. last year, corporations of all sizes accounted for nearly 23 percent of all federal income taxes paid, or around $395 billion, according to previously released data from trac. that is up significantly from 2001, when corporations accounted for 13.7 percent of all taxes paid, an all-time low. individuals paid the rest. despite the shift in focus, the i.r.s. is bringing in more money from corporations of all sizes through audits. last year it brought in more than $59 billion in unpaid tax revenues, according to agency statistics. that is nearly twice the level of 1998 and is consistent with a steady climb since then. larry langdon, who ran the i.r.s.'s large and midsize business division from 1999 to 2003, called those amounts \"phenomenal\" and said that the number of dollars brought in, rather than the type or size of company audited or the amount of time spent on audits, might be a better indicator of how well the i.r.s. is doing.",

        "title": "accusations of delays in releasing drug results.",
        "abstract": "chicago the lead outside investigator on a crucial trial of two widely used heart drugs said in an e-mail message last july that merck and schering-plough , the companies that make the drugs, were deliberately delaying the release of the trial results \"to hide something.\" the companies did not release the preliminary results of the trial, called enhance, until january, almost two years after the trial was finished. when they were finally released, the trial's results showed that the drugs, vytorin and zetia, did not work to reduce plaque in arteries. the results led a panel of cardiologists to recommend on sunday that the drugs be used only as a last resort. the new information was contained in e-mail messages to executives at schering-plough that were released monday by senator charles e. grassley of iowa, the ranking republican on the senate finance committee. the committee has been investigating the delay in the release of the enhance trial results. it is likely to inflame the controversy over the way that merck and schering-plough handled the enhance trial, as well as their heavy promotion of vytorin and zetia. the drugs are used to lower cholesterol and are among the most widely prescribed medicines in the united states, with sales of $5 billion last year. shares of merck and schering plunged on monday. the enhance investigator, dr. john j. p. kastelein, also complained last july that merck and schering had not consulted him on the reasons for the delay and threatened to resign as the main study investigator. a spokeswoman for schering-plough said the messages had been presented out of context and that dr. kastelein's complaints had been resolved months ago. zetia lowers cholesterol by blocking its absorption in the intestine. vytorin combines zetia with simvastatin, another cholesterol-lowering drug sold under the brand name zocor . dr. kastelein is a dutch cardiologist and scientist whom merck and schering hired to conduct the enhance trial, which consisted of images of the arteries of 720 patients taking either vytorin the combination of zetia and zocor or zocor alone. because vytorin lowers cholesterol more than zocor alone, the companies expected that the trial would show that patients who took vytorin had less growth of plaque in their arteries than those who took zocor. arterial plaque is closely correlated with heart attack and strokes. the trial ended in april 2006, and its results were initially expected in late 2006 or early 2007. the companies repeatedly delayed releasing the results of the trial, however, saying publicly that many of the images of the arteries were unclear and might need to be re-examined. by july 2007, dr. kastelein was privately furious with the companies for the delays, his messages show. \"is it correct that sp has decided not to present at aha?\" he said july 6 in an e-mail message to dr. rick veltri, a vice president at the schering-plough research institute, referring to the american heart association conference in november. \"if this is the case, our collaboration is over,\" he wrote, adding, \"this starts smelling like extending the publication for no other [than] political reasons and i cannot live with that.\" the next day, according to the text of the messages released by senator grassley, dr. kastelein complained that the companies seemed to be trying to slow the release of the results by including data that was not relevant and would take more time to compile. by doing so, he wrote, \"you will be seen as a company that tries to hide something and i will be perceived as being in bed with you!\" dr. kastelein did not respond to requests for comment. rosemarie yancosek, a spokeswoman for schering, said, \"the e-mails selectively excerpted in the letter concern an issue that merck-schering-plough and we believe, also dr. kastelein consider long resolved.\" dr. harlan m. krumholz, a cardiologist at yale, said dr. kastelein's messages raised new concerns over the nearly two-year delay in the release of the enhance results. \"what raises concerns here is the possibility that the delay was being imposed by the companies against the wishes of the principal investigator, who should be the leader of the study,\" dr. krumholz said. \"i hope that there was a good scientific explanation, endorsed by a steering committee of credible scientists at the time of the decision to delay, which explains why the public and the profession had to wait so long.\" on sunday, dr. krumholz and three other cardiologists told an audience of more than 5,000 people at the annual american college of cardiology scientific convention that vytorin and zetia should not be used except as a last resort. the two major cardiology associations seconded those recommendations on monday, leading to a plunge in shares of merck and schering. merck fell $6.56, or 15 percent, to $37.95. schering, which is smaller and even more dependent on profits from zetia and vytorin, fell $5.06, or 26 percent, to $14.41. prescriptions for the medicines have already dipped about 15 percent since january, when preliminary results from the enhance trial were first disclosed. still, the drugs are widely used, with about three million prescriptions written each month in the united states alone. ldl cholesterol, the harmful kind, is known as a risk factor for heart disease, and so doctors have generally assumed that lowering ldl cholesterol by any means would reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. but proving that a drug actually cuts those risks requires an expensive, multiyear clinical trial enrolling 10,000 or more patients. those studies, called outcomes trials, have been conducted for statins, and they have proved that patients taking those drugs do have a reduced risk of heart disease. no such outcomes trials exist for vytorin and zetia. in 2006, four years after zetia reached the market, merck and schering began enrolling patients in their own outcomes study, which compares people taking vytorin with those taking zocor alone. but the results of the trial are not likely to be available until 2012, or possibly later.",

        "abstract": "san francisco a generation ago, when tommy remengesau jr. went fishing off the beautiful island nation of palau, the seas were so rich, he said, that \"i could see great stocks of fish.\" such bounty has since dwindled, in palau and worldwide. \"reckless and destructive fishing practices, overfishing, and illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing have robbed us of our resources,\" mr. remengesau, now palau's president, told the united nations general assembly this month. \"they must be stopped.\" that grim pronouncement lies behind a new plan by palau to ban commercial fishing in a vast area off its coast. the reserve will cover 230,000 square miles, which is about the size of ukraine. palau is far from alone other nations are also engaging in efforts to create marine reserves. new zealand, which already has a number of protected areas, is establishing a new conservation area in its far southern region that is off-limits to fishing, mining and oil exploration, though it is smaller, at 1,680 square miles. over all, 2.8 percent of the world's oceans have been committed to conservation reserves , according to the international union for conservation of nature, a global environmental group. that remains far short of an international goal of 10 percent . the reserves are often called marine protected areas, or m.p.a.s. \"there is a trend toward creating more m.p.a.s in recent years,\" said samantha murray, director of the pacific program at the ocean conservancy, an environmental group. but the percentage of ocean territory that is protected is far lower than the comparable figure for land, she said. a big problem is that the quality of the reserves varies. a new study in the journal nature found that of 87 marine protected areas surveyed, 59 percent \"were not ecologically distinguishable from fished sites.\" the reality may be even more dismal, because the survey included some of the world's most effective reserves. a different study, to be published next week in the journal aquatic conservation: marine and freshwater ecosystems, finds that countries often seek to create marine reserves in areas that are the least used, rather than focusing on maximizing biodiversity. achieving targets for protecting a certain amount of the ocean could therefore result in a \"false sense of achievement for conservation,\" it warns. \"it's almost universal, the fact that whenever there's negotiations over marine protected areas, the areas with most fish are retained by the fishing areas,\" said graham edgar, a professor at the institute for marine and antarctic studies at the university of tasmania in australia. professor edgar was involved in both studies. relatively few marine protected areas include a blanket ban on fishing and other commercial activities. some may allow only certain types of fishing. most have been created relatively close to coastlines, rather than in the open ocean. according to the nature study, reserves are more successful if they are large (at least 100 square kilometers, or almost 40 square miles) and enduring (established for at least 10 years). in addition, effective reserves generally include and enforce a ban on fishing and other activities harmful to marine life, like mining and drilling. ecological isolation of the reserves, for example by sand barriers, also helps so that fish do not swim away. marine areas with all of these characteristics contained 840 percent more large fish, measured by mass, than comparable areas open to fishing, the nature study found. they also contained an impressive 1,990 percent more shark mass. some of the world's most effective protected areas, according to the nature study, surround small ocean islands. these include the seas around cocos island national park in costa rica, which are frequented by sharks and turtles and other large creatures; an area around malpelo island, a few hundred miles off the pacific coast of colombia; and, in the south pacific, areas near the kermadec islands of new zealand and middleton reef off australia. conservationists hope several more large areas will win protection soon. in the southeastern part of the pacific, excitement is building around proposed protections near the pitcairn islands, controlled by britain, and also easter island, controlled by chile. in the atlantic, parts of the sargasso sea and also a large area around bermuda are under consideration. so is an area in the ross sea in the antarctic ocean, though objections from russia and ukraine are proving hard to surmount . reserves on the high seas, outside nationally controlled waters, generally need international approval and may be administered by groups of governments. but large, remote areas may face a particular challenge in enforcing fishing restrictions, according to ms. murray of the ocean conservancy. regions where restrictions vary from one section to another, like a patchwork, also are difficult to police. illegal fishing is \"a huge problem\" and affects a majority of marine protected areas, dr. edgar said. still, he added, enforcement \"doesn't necessarily have to have patrol boats going past; it can be the good will of the local community.\" technology can help. vessel monitoring systems for big boats and digital photography are two tools. palau, a tiny nation with just one patrol boat to police its vast offshore territory, has tested drones as a means of spotting illegal activity. mr. remengesau, palau's president, says his nation will focus on drawing tourists to its still-wondrous seascape, while hoping that other countries will join the preservation effort. \"i return again and again to a question my forebears never conceived of,\" mr. remengesau told the general assembly. \"how much will palau's efforts matter if the world is not on the same page?\"",

        "title": "foreign donors pledge $3 billion to help rebuild quake-ravaged nepal.",
        "abstract": "kathmandu, nepal as foreign donors and agencies pledged more than $3 billion in aid for nepal on thursday to support its post-earthquake reconstruction, the government sought to assure would-be contributors that the funds would be used effectively. \"we will share periodically the use of the funds to maintain transparency because you are accountable to your own citizens,\" prime minister sushil koirala told an international donors' conference in kathmandu, the nepalese capital, where most of the pledges were announced. more than 8,800 people were killed in the earthquakes in april and may, and over half a million homes were destroyed, making the construction of housing a pressing need. india, which borders nepal and quickly mobilized an emergency response after the first earthquake, was the single largest donor, with sushma swaraj, india's external affairs minister, pledging $1 billion for reconstruction at the meeting. thursday's commitment was on top of a previously announced $1 billion over the next five years. maps of the damage from the nepal earthquakes maps show the landscape of temporary shelters, the epicenter of the earthquake and its aftershocks. \"nepal and india are joined in both their joys and sorrows,\" ms. swaraj said in kathmandu. \"therefore, we need to closely coordinate our disaster response and help each other in the wake of such calamities.\" foreign minister wang yi of china promised $483 million, while the japanese government pledged $260 million. further commitments came from the asian development bank, britain, the united states, the european union and other countries. the world bank on tuesday pledged a loan of up to $500 million, partly for the reconstruction of housing in rural areas and for the government's budget. the total promised, including previously announced commitments from india and china, was about $4.4 billion, nepal's finance minister, ram sharan mahat, said, more than half of what nepal has said it needs, while the largest governmental pledges came from the country's neighbors in asia. in a report released last week, the nepal planning commission estimated the cost of reconstruction at $6.7 billion, about a third of the country's annual economic output of just over $19 billion. the report detailed additional areas of focus for reconstruction, including schools, roads, government buildings, agriculture and heritage monuments. chandan sapkota, an economist at the asian development bank who is based in nepal, said concerns remained over the capacity of the nepalese government, mired in bureaucratic delays, to use the aid effectively. how to rebuild after an earthquake like nepal's experts offer tips on how a country like nepal can rebuild after an earthquake with whatever materials are available. the nepalese government announced on monday that it would set up a new autonomous authority to oversee the spending of donated reconstruction funds, but it has not yet provided a road map for how the authority would operate. \"we need a plan from the government that we can spend the money within four to five years,\" mr. sapkota said. \"and that's a very tall order.\" nepal's finance minister, ram sharan mahat, said on thursday that the trade deficit for the current fiscal year, set to end next month, would grow in the earthquake's aftermath, deepening the need for donor funds. even as the central government made assurances that the funds would be implemented efficiently, officials in earthquake-affected districts have said that the government's plan to immediately provide $2,000 to families for home rebuilding is mired in red tape. it has also been difficult to verify the identity of quake victims, said devendra raj lamichhane, the chief district officer of dolakha, which was hard-hit by the second earthquake on may 12, when nearly 200 people in the district died. mr. sapkota, the economist, said the donors had \"played their part they've pledged a lot of money.\" he added that the asian development bank's commitment of up to $600 million would largely go to reconstructing government schools. \"now, it's up to the government to spend it,\" he said.",

        "title": "obama hears parting advice as power shifts.",
        "abstract": "washington as he played host to his successor and three predecessors for a luncheon meeting of the world's most exclusive club on wednesday, president bush offered their collective support. \"we wish you all the very best,\" he told president-elect barack obama as the cameras rolled in the oval office. \"and so does the country.\" with that, the junior white house aides in charge of corralling the pool of reporters and cameramen called out, \"thank you,\" turned down the lights and began trying to hustle them out of the room. but suddenly mr. obama interjected. he had a few words to say, so the reporters hustled back into place and the lights were turned back up. \"i just want to thank the president for hosting us,\" mr. obama said, with the cameras now trained on him. \"this is an extraordinary gathering. all the gentlemen here understand both the pressures and possibilities of the office and for me to have the opportunity to get advice, good counsel and fellowship with these individuals is extraordinary. and i'm very grateful to all of them.\" it was a small moment, inconsequential perhaps, yet also revealing one more tiny signal of the shifting power in washington that will culminate with mr. obama's inauguration in 12 days. typically when reporters are brought into the oval office, the president talks; guests speak only if invited to. when the president is done, the press pool is quickly extracted from the room. but mr. bush is no longer the paramount figure in town, and mr. obama no ordinary guest. mr. bush held the luncheon on wednesday so that all the living figures who have sat in his chair could offer their counsel and camaraderie to the next man who will occupy it. mr. bush's father was there, as were bill clinton and jimmy carter . and it was only one of many ways in which mr. bush, and members of his team, have been offering their advice to their successors in recent days, sometimes heeded, sometimes not. wednesday was filled with departing bush administration figures leaving behind their thoughts. vice president dick cheney gave an interview in which he urged mr. obama not to jettison the policies he and mr. bush enacted to fight terrorism. stephen j. hadley , the national security adviser, delivered a speech detailing the challenges he sees around the world for mr. obama. and kenneth wainstein, the homeland security adviser, gave a separate talk in which he urged continued vigilance. \"if i had advice to give, it would be, before you start to implement your campaign rhetoric, you need to sit down and find out precisely what it is we did and how we did it, because it is going to be vital to keeping the nation safe and secure in the years ahead,\" mr. cheney told mark knoller of cbs radio. \"and it would be a tragedy if they threw over those policies simply because they had campaigned against them.\" mr. cheney was referring specifically to the administration's surveillance and interrogation programs that have proved so controversial but that in his view were \"absolutely essential\" in preventing any terrorist attack on american soil after sept. 11, 2001. \"they need to proceed very cautiously before they begin to change the policies that are in place,\" mr. cheney said. \"they need to know what they're doing.\" over at the center for strategic and international studies , mr. hadley provided his own assessment of events in the world and how american relations with each region stand, arguing that mr. bush has put in place the building blocks for future progress that mr. obama could expand on. in particular, he urged mr. obama to continue pressing for greater freedom and democracy in places like the middle east . mr. hadley acknowledged that mr. obama is being left with many challenges to confront. \"i think 'loose ends' is putting it mildly,\" he said in answer to a question from the audience, provoking laughter. \"look, there has, i think, rarely been a president who has had more challenges he would say opportunities than president bush. and that means that there rarely has been an incoming president who has as many challenges and opportunities as president-elect obama.\" like many of his colleagues at the white house, mr. hadley has been working closely with the incoming obama administration to try to provide a more informed transition. he told the audience at the center that his staff has prepared memorandums on 40 major issues for mr. obama's advisers, each describing what the bush team inherited, what it did about them and what it is leaving behind. although he did not discuss it in detail, mr. hadley's staff has also put together contingency plans for mr. obama's administration outlining options for responding to potential crises that could arise in the opening hours or days of the next presidency when new officials are still trying to figure out how to make the telephones work. \"i was in the transition from president ford to president carter and i must say i was surprised,\" mr. hadley recalled. \"i stayed on with the new team for about three weeks and all the vaunted secure filing cabinets in the old e.o.b. were empty. there was not a single piece of paper that was transitioned to the new team. and i've always thought this was very not good governance at its best.\" (the old e.o.b. was the old executive office building next to the white house where most of the president's staff works. today it has been renamed the eisenhower executive office building.) mr. wainstein gave his own summation of the fight against weapons of mass destruction during a talk at the washington institute for near east policy, outlining all that he said the bush administration had done to prevent a cataclysmic attack through nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. he urged mr. obama's administration to follow the bush lead in this area. \"they are inheriting a comprehensive w.m.d. strategy, one that is being implemented by strong counterterrorism institutions, far-reaching initiatives and cooperative international relationships,\" he said. all this advice, public and private, is being well received by mr. obama's advisers, who have uniformly praised the outgoing bush team for going out of its way to be helpful. but in the end, it will be up to mr. obama to make the decisions soon enough. and the lights will not be turned down in the oval office until he has had his say.",

        "abstract": "new york city has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the mother of a mentally disturbed inmate whose lawyers charged that he was beaten to death after a struggle with correction officers in the prison ward at bellevue hospital center in 2007. the inmate, patrick miller, had punched a correction officer and was subdued by other officers and handcuffed behind his back, according to a memorandum by the department of investigation, one agency that investigated the episode. that part of the altercation was captured on video, the memo noted. but lawyers for the mother, billie ann miller, contended that mr. miller was then taken into a holding cell without video coverage and was fatally beaten there. one of ms. miller's lawyers, jonathan s. abady, said that while no payment could ever compensate for the loss of her son, the amount showed \"something horribly wrong happened here, and was worthy of compensation.\" \"i think there was a need on the part of the family to move forward, to have closure, to be able to complete the grieving process,\" said mr. abady, whose firm, emery celli brinckerhoff & abady, handled the suit, along with the legal aid society. a legal aid lawyer, jonathan chasan, said mr. miller's death was \"a manifestation of a longstanding problem at bellevue, which was the use of inappropriate physical force on prisoner-patients.\" after mr. miller's death, he said, video cameras were installed in the two cells where hospitalized inmates are held during intake on the prison ward. curt p. beck, a city lawyer, said on wednesday: \"we feel the settlement was in all parties' best interests. we hope it brings a measure of closure to the family.\" the city admitted no fault in the settlement. an autopsy by the medical examiner's office found evidence of \"multiple blunt trauma\" on mr. miller's head, neck and upper body, and said the cause of death was \"probable cardiac arrhythmia following a struggle.\" the manner of death was undetermined, the report said. a plaintiff's expert, dr. charles v. wetli, a former suffolk county medical examiner, concluded that mr. miller's death had been a homicide. no charges were brought in the death, which was also investigated by the manhattan district attorney's office, the city's medical examiner and the police department. federal prosecutors in manhattan and the f.b.i. also opened an investigation . in a may 15 letter to the judge, katherine b. forrest of federal district court in manhattan, mr. beck wrote that he had been told by federal prosecutors that the federal investigation had been concluded. neither federal agency would comment.",

        "abstract": "washington a federal judge ruled on monday that she had no power to order the military to refrain from force-feeding a detainee at the prison at guantanamo bay, cuba. but in an unusual move, the judge made a direct appeal to president obama to address issues raised by the hunger strike at the prison that has lasted months. in a four-page ruling, judge gladys kessler of the federal district court for the district of columbia, rejected a request by the detainee, jihad ahmed mujstafa diyab , a 41-year-old syrian man, to issue an injunction barring the military from forcing him to eat through a gastric tube inserted in his nose after restraining him in a chair. judge kessler noted that the force-feeding of detainees had been condemned as a violation of medical ethics and human rights by groups as varied as the american medical association and top united nations officials. and while the obama administration defended its treatment of detainees as compassionate, she wrote, \"it is perfectly clear\" that \"force-feeding is a painful, humiliating and degrading process.\" nevertheless, judge kessler said she could not issue an injunction because congress had barred the courts from intervening on issues involving conditions at the prison. but mr. obama, she wrote, \"does have the authority to address the issue,\" and she cited a speech in may in which he appeared to lament force-feedings. she noted that as commander in chief, mr. obama would seem to have the power \"to directly address the issue of force-feeding of the detainees at guantanamo bay.\" still, the judge also noted that transfer restrictions imposed by congress had made repatriations to countries with troubled security conditions difficult, and she did not say what she thought mr. obama should do. a white house spokeswoman declined to comment. a pentagon spokesman, col. todd breasseale, said it was humane not to let prisoners commit suicide and noted that at a news conference in april, mr. obama had explained , \"i don't want these individuals to die.\" mr. diyab, who has been held at guantanamo for nearly 11 years, was recommended for transfer four years ago if security measures could be met. he is among 45 detainees who are \"approved\" for force-feedings if they refuse to eat, out of the 106 detainees participating in the hunger strike, according to the military. he is also one of at least four detainees who have asked judges to halt the practice. jon eisenberg, a lawyer working on the case with the british human-rights group reprieve , said they were considering appealing but were waiting for a ruling about the other detainees. but he noted that \"not often do you see a federal judge appealing to the president to do something the judge would like to do but feels she lacks jurisdiction to do.\" the judge wrote that her ruling was brief because she had dealt with a similar request in 2009, which she cited, and because mr. diyab had also asked for an injunction barring the military from force-feeding him during daylight during ramadan the islamic holy month that began on monday and during which observant muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. col. gregory julian of the united states southern command, which oversees guantanamo, said that prison guards and medical staff members would administer meals to detainees who wished to observe ramadan at night and that the prison had the capacity to carry out mass force-feedings of some of the hunger strikers after sunset as well. colonel julian said that fewer than half of the 45 prisoners approved for force-feedings were actually being fed that way because the others either ate in private or swallowed a nutritional supplement to avoid the nasal tube insertions. colonel julian also said that about 40 detainees who had not joined the hunger strike and were otherwise compliant with prison rules were being put back into communal housing conditions. in april, guards raided the communal cellblocks amid the growing protest and forced most of the detainees into single-cell lockdown.",

        "abstract": "stocks posted modest losses friday after a disappointing monthly jobs report renewed concerns that a recovery in the troubled labor market might be a long way off. the dow jones industrial average fell for a fourth day, losing 22 points a day after tumbling 203 points on thursday. the latest weak economic report came from the labor department, which said employers cut 263,000 jobs last month. that was more than the 201,000 cut in august and worse than the 175,000 economists were expecting. the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent, in line with forecasts. \"there's been a lot of talk particularly in the last couple of months that we're seeing a turnaround in unemployment, and obviously that's not the case,\" said dan cook, senior market analyst at ig markets in chicago. meanwhile, an unexpected drop in factory orders extended the recent string of disappointing economic readings. the commerce department said factory orders fell 0.8 percent in august after a 1.4 percent gain in july. analysts had been expecting a 0.7 percent increase. the market's optimism has been tested this week by several indicators that have either weakened or fallen short of expectations, a disappointment after several months of hopeful signs on crucial industries like housing and manufacturing. that has led investors to question whether the 50 percent surge in stocks in the last six months can be sustained. with nerves running high, stocks have fallen in seven of the last eight days. the dow jones industrials have pulled back about 4.3 percent since coming within 82 points of the 10,000 level last week. \"people have had a long, hard week,\" said bruce shalett, managing partner at wynston hill capital in new york. many found the relatively calm response to the jobs report encouraging, taking it as a sign that there were still investors willing to use the dips to pick up stocks they considered cheap. \"pullbacks are going to constantly be used as opportunities to get into the market,\" said hank smith, chief investment officer of equity at haverford investments in radnor, pa. the dow fell 21.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to 9,487.67, after being down as much as 79 points. the standard & poor's 500-stock index fell 4.64 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,025.21, and the nasdaq composite fell 9.37 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,048.11. for the week, the dow and the s.& p. 500 index each lost 1.8 percent, while the nasdaq fell 2 percent. two stocks fell for every one that rose on the new york stock exchange, where volume came to 1.4 billion shares friday compared with 1.6 billion thursday. stocks are coming off a banner third quarter. both the dow and the s.& p. 500 gained 15 percent in the july-september period. it was the dow's best quarter since 1998. the fourth quarter may not be as stellar. analysts expect the market to drift over the next couple of weeks as investors await quarterly earnings reports and company forecasts on business activity. the last meaningful pullback in the market since the rally began in march came during the four weeks leading up to second-quarter reports this summer, when the major indexes lost about 7 percent. \"october is shaping up to be a challenging month for investors,\" said brent mcquiston, a vice president at wealthtrust-arizona. strong earnings could help offset growing concerns about a recovery and stabilize the market, he said, but solid revenue growth is what is needed to put the market on firm footing. in the meantime, the market will get reports on the service sector, retail sales and wholesale trade inventories next week. yields on long-term treasuries moved off their lowest levels since the spring. the treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 103 13/32, and the yield rose to 3.22 percent, from 3.18 percent late thursday. crude oil fell 87 cents to settle at $69.95 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange.",

        "abstract": "sunil gulati was sitting inside his office at columbia university late monday morning when a student walked in and began to cry. this, gulati later explained, was not particularly unusual this time of year. since 2006, when gulati was voted president of the united states soccer federation, his public profile and his professional commitments have steadily risen. in 2013, he was elected to the executive committee of fifa, the powerful governing body of world soccer, and he began to distinguish himself as a reformer. among his professional goals, he harbors a desire to bring the world cup back to the united states. but in that time, gulati has also cultivated a separate identity also celebrated, if less widely known in academia as a lecturer in the columbia economics department. a major element of this renown, wholly apart from soccer, has been a rousing lecture that he has delivered for years on the final day of each semester in his introductory-level course, principles of economics which students often refer to simply as principles. after 27 class sessions barreling through course material, the last lecture is his opportunity to remind students of the inequality in the world, point out their relatively privileged position in it, entreat them to have compassion for others and, as the often-emotional students make clear, tug a bit at their heartstrings. \"it's about getting students to understand that the things we talk about in market economics aren't the only pieces that matter,\" gulati said monday in his office, which is covered in soccer memorabilia, after he delivered his last lecture of the semester. \"the distribution issues matter. equity issues matter. and it's not only to get them to think about those issues but to potentially act on those issues.\" the material, which gulati slyly referred to as \"change-the-world stuff,\" is mostly drawn from his travels and his encounters with global poverty. on monday, it seemed to touch a latent nerve in srishti sinha, a first-year student who felt compelled to find gulati after the class even though she had a paper due that afternoon. sinha worked in bangalore, india her hometown last summer for storybook me, a group that promotes reading among children by making them personalized books. her year at columbia had given rise to an internal debate, she said, between \"helping myself and helping others.\" the lecture revived it. \"i've always wanted to do more,\" sinha said, smiling as she wiped tears from her face, \"and gulati's lecture sort of brought me back that and made me realize that maybe what i was thinking before is the right way to go.\" gulati, 55, teaches another lecture course called global economics and a small seminar focusing on sports business that drew guest speakers this semester like n.b.a. commissioner adam silver. but it is the final lecture of principles of economics, which has about 200 students, that seems to stick with students. adam stansell, who has been a teacher's assistant for gulati and will graduate this year with a bachelor's degree in economics, said students gave gulati a standing ovation when stansell first attended the lecture. aditi sriram, an adjunct professor of english at the state university of new york college at purchase, returned to columbia with an old classmate in 2013, six years after they had graduated, just to hear the semester-closing lecture again. \"you leave on this high,\" sriram said, \"because he says, 'stop taking notes; put your notebooks and pens away,' and suddenly he's extemporizing about his family.\" gulati spent the first half of class on monday in a socratic exercise, asking students if they would rather create a world in which half the people lived in the slums of kolkata, india, and the other half in scarsdale, n.y., or one in which everyone were a farmer in argentina. gulati had about a dozen students chime in as he paced the room, guiding the discussion. \"i believe that the people in scarsdale could give to the people of calcutta to improve their infrastructure and their quality of life,\" one student said, using the indian city's former name. gulati said, bluntly, \"somebody has to have a response to that,\" a remark that made the students laugh. then, as he does every semester, gulati turned the discussion to his personal experiences. he spoke about going to calcutta in 1983 as a graduate student \"i wanted to be shocked\" and visiting a hospital there where half the patients died within 48 hours of being admitted. days later, as he was watching the sun rise from an opulent hotel in bombay, the discrepancy between the two environments ate at him. he recalled his trip to mexico city for the world cup in 1986, one year after a major earthquake, to serve as a spotter for the broadcaster charlie jones, who needed real-time tutoring in soccer during games. before the first game, gulati gave a match ticket to a 10-year-old boy, who froze, confused, because he did not know what was expected of him in return. years later, while working for the world bank in gambia, gulati visited a medical clinic where the supplies, he said, were akin to those in a basic first-aid kit. he thought of this years later during the birth of his daughter as six doctors and nurses attended to his wife. gulati, who also has a son, suggested that mothers in gambia loved their babies no less but were far less likely to have them survive. \"i used to think that i gave this talk because it would let me sleep better at night,\" gulati told his students. \"then i thought it really was making sure all of you didn't sleep well at night. maybe it's some bit of both.\" gulati consciously steers clear of inserting sports into his class. but to make his final point, he invoked the idea of an athlete who could tolerate pain in a big game. \"it seems to me the mark of a great person is not a tolerance of pain,\" gulati said, \"but an intolerance of pain in others.\"",

        "abstract": "stuart elliott, the advertising columnist, answers questions from readers each week. questions can be sent to <email> . q. i enjoyed your recent column in the new york times about new advertising for at&t . it stimulated some thoughts to share with you. after at&t was purchased by sbc, the headquarters was moved to texas. and so many top-management shuffles occurred in the last half decade that the brand and its current agency, bbdo, really seem to have amnesia. the new campaign, and the phrase it introduces, \"it's what you do with what we do,\" appears little more than a restatement of at&t's widely acclaimed campaign of 1997-98 that carried the theme \"it's all within your reach.\" the strategic intent then was identical to what it is now: a wide range of at&t's technology and products deliver personal empowerment to consumers, defined through cute and inspiring creative stories. that message was relevant back in the late 1990s, with the then-explosive growth of wireless and the advent of e-mail. and it is now even more relevant with all the newest tech services and products we have. you probably also remember some of the famous tv spots associated with the previous campaign, including one named \"beaches .\" so at&t's newest statement, \"it's what you do with what we do\" is therefore not \"breakthrough\" at all. rather, it is updated language for \"it's all within your reach.\" at&t and bbdo apparently arrived at this strategy with no mention or acknowledgement that the approach is actually a strategic revival. i can't help but think how powerful the at&t brand would be if only it had stayed the course with \"it's all within your reach\" for the last 14 years. it is such a timeless line. i'm quite happy at&t has now returned to its spirit. a. thanks, dear reader, for the comments. i would not hold my breath waiting for a marketer, or an agency, to acknowledge that new work is inspired by previous work, particularly if was created by a previous agency rather than the current agency. (\"it's all within your reach\" was created by y&r new york, part of the y&r division of the young & rubicam group, owned by wpp. bbdo worldwide is part of the omnicom group.) but it is also increasingly common for marketers to revive previous themes, slogans, jingles and brand characters as part of what is known as comfort marketing, which resonates with consumers during hard times . so perhaps someday there will be some kind of hat-tip to previous ads when current ads echo them. q. forgive me if you're already familiar with this. i recently bought a cup of coffee at penn station, complete with sleeve. there was an advertisement for jennifer love hewitt 's new lifetime cable show, \"the client list,\" printed on the sleeve, featuring a racy photo of ms. hewitt. when i got to my office, and the coffee had cooled, the photo was gone. i suspected what had happened and refilled the cup with hot water and voila ! the image was back. very clever. a . the idea for the cardboard salute to ms. hewitt's, er, um, hotness was brought to lifetime by its media agency, horizon media, \"who we're always challenging to be a little more innovative,\" says tim nolan, senior vice president for marketing at lifetime, part of a&e networks, which is owned by the nbcuniversal unit of comcast, walt disney and hearst. mr. nolan is pleased enough with the idea, and how it turned out, to share a video clip showing how it works . the sleeves are a product of a company named the brite media group, he says. about 500,000 sleeves were distributed to 200 coffee shops and coffeehouses, 100 in new york and 100 in and around los angeles. there were also \"coffee break\" events at some of those stores, where patrons received free coffee. anecdotally, there has been a good deal of buzz generated by the promotion, mr. nolan says, so it seems like \"they're penetrating.\" for instance, \"some of our salespeople got a response when they went on calls,\" he adds, and there was even word that \"friends of jennifer love hewitt\" were aware of the promotion. the sleeves were part of an extensive campaign for \"the client list,\" which prominently featured ms. hewitt in poses that some deemed provocative . the campaign apparently made an impact. the premiere episode of \"the client list,\" on april 8, drew an average of 2.8 million viewers, nielsen reported , a total that far exceeded the average viewership for other recent lifetime premieres like \"the protector,\" at 1.9 million. the total viewers for \"the client list\" in a nielsen measure called live plus three for live viewing plus dvr viewing within three days was larger, at 3.4 million.",

        "title": "100,000 units of housing are planned in new jersey.",
        "abstract": "trenton, aug. 9 acknowledging that housing in new jersey is becoming increasingly unaffordable, the corzine administration says in a report to be made public on thursday that it plans to build 100,000 homes and apartments over the next 10 years for poor, working-class and middle-class residents. in the state's first attempt at outlining a comprehensive housing strategy, the 44-page report evaluates the shortcomings of current housing programs and sets the stage for gov. jon s. corzine to announce the details of a comprehensive housing program with specific recommendations and price tags by the end of the year. \"this is the foundation,\" susan bass levin, the state's commissioner of community affairs, said about the report, which was prepared by her department. \"it looks at what we've done. it looks at the challenges in terms of what we need to do.\" in scope and in approach, the plan is analogous to one undertaken by mayor michael r. bloomberg of new york in december 2002 to build or preserve 65,000 units over five years mr. corzine has frequently said he admires the governing approach of mr. bloomberg, and like him says he intends to emphasize the shortage of housing not just for the poorest residents, as housing advocacy groups have historically emphasized, but also for working-class and middle-class people. and ms. levin said, \"we need to provide a full range of housing.\" mr. corzine has made references to 100,000 units in the past as early as last year in the governor's race and as recently as june during an event with the housing and community development network of new jersey here although in general terms. the report says that new jersey has actually exceeded a goal, set four years ago, of building or financing 20,000 units of housing. but that pace is not fast enough, the report adds, and now, \"the gap between supply and demand of affordable housing is one of new jersey's biggest challenges.\" in particular, the report says that the costs to create housing, like land, construction and labor, are increasing far more quickly than expected, at a time when federal financing for housing has been stagnant or decreasing. and given the fact that housing and land are so expensive, \"new jersey has consistently ranked as one of the least affordable states for rental housing.\" yet new jersey does not have an effective program to encourage home ownership among moderate-income residents, the report concludes. the report also delves into deed-restricted housing, referring to housing initiatives, like the federal section 8 program, which deliberately keep housing units at an artificially low price, usually for periods of 10 to 30 years. \"the state is currently experiencing its most significant wave of expiring deed restrictions, resulting in the potential loss of thousands of units of housing per year,\" the report warns. \"many of these units are in healthy real estate markets where affordable housing is the most difficult and costly to replicate.\" one housing advocate who saw an earlier draft of the report, diane sterner, executive director of the housing and community development network of new jersey, said that she found the analysis to be sound and the approach to be refreshing. \"you're always a little concerned when there's any dilution of attention of resources from the people who have traditionally had the greatest housing needs,\" she cautioned. \"but as long as they figure out the appropriate strategies, and become more comprehensive in their thinking to promote a mix of income groups, i think it's a good thing for new jersey.\"",

        "title": "cash in hand, technology giants go shopping.",
        "abstract": "san francisco most consumers do not want to get a pc by purchasing microprocessors, hard drives and operating system software from different suppliers and assembling them all into a working computer. they prefer to buy a complete, customized machine from one supplier. corporate customers increasingly want the same thing: a one-stop shop for hardware, software and services. and the largest technology companies are deploying their huge cash hoards to make acquisitions to bolster their ability to be that single provider. that trend drove oracle , a leader in business software, to announce monday that it was spending $7.4 billion to buy an ailing sun microsystems and get into the computer hardware business. oracle beat out rival i.b.m., which considered buying sun to enhance its own software offerings but ended serious acquisition talks about two weeks ago. \"oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system applications to disk where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves,\" oracle's chief executive, lawrence j. ellison, said monday. the drive to consolidate has made life difficult for independent companies like sun, and the fall of such an industry stalwart highlights the mounting pressure on smaller firms in the computer, storage and software industries to find buyers. even larger companies like emc and dell could be vulnerable, industry observers say. \"i believe that we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning consolidation game,\" said william t. coleman iii, a former sun executive and co-founder of bea systems, who is now chief of the software start-up cassatt. \"it's not over by any stretch of the imagination, and there are drastic things that still have to happen.\" five years ago, oracle bought peoplesoft for more than $10 billion, igniting a furious rush to scoop up other business software makers. oracle alone has since bought more than 40 other companies, spending close to $15 billion for bea and siebel systems alone. many of the companies purchased by oracle had carved out a niche for themselves during the internet build-out, providing unique functions that assisted a rapid infrastructure expansion. in the years after the dot-com bust, however, customers grew weary of visits from hordes of software salesmen peddling isolated wares. a simpler model evolved, in which a handful of companies like oracle, i.b.m. and hewlett-packard bought dozens of smaller players and then competed to sell most of the software needed to run a modern business. \"the core just keeps getting denser and denser,\" said randall n. spratt, the chief information officer at mckesson, one of the nation's largest health care companies. \"we welcome large-scale players at the core.\" while software companies led the last round of consolidation, the hardware industry now appears poised for its own reshaping. \"i think we're at an inflection point,\" said patricia c. sueltz, a former i.b.m. and sun executive, who runs the start-up loglogic. for example, rackable systems, a smaller server computer maker, announced plans this month to buy silicon graphics for $25 million. like sun, silicon graphics started in 1982, and had been one of the fastest-growing businesses in america during its heyday, selling billions of dollars of computers a year. as the computer business has matured, companies that handcraft products for top performance face a harsh reality: standard equipment can now handle most business tasks, and what matters most to customers now is large scale and the low prices that come with it. over the last decade, h.p. has driven much of the consolidation through a series of large acquisitions. it bought compaq computer in 2001, which affected both the pc and server markets as other companies fought to expand and match h.p.'s reach. for example, the chinese computer maker lenovo bought i.b.m.'s pc business, and acer, based in taiwan, acquired gateway, which had already acquired emachines. last year, h.p. purchased electronic data systems, one of the largest technology services companies, in a bid to counter i.b.m.'s immense services organization. the e.d.s. purchase also threatened the businesses of sun and cisco systems, which have sold large amounts of equipment to e.d.s.'s customers. most recently, the largest technology companies have decided to encroach on each other's turf. for example, h.p. has increased its investment in networking technology, hoping to pull business away from cisco, and cisco has countered by building its own server products. oracle's purchase of sun is an even more drastic lurch into its rivals' territory, as oracle will find itself in the unfamiliar position of selling hardware, while also picking up sun's prized software assets, like its solaris operating system, java programming language and open-source mysql database. lurking behind all of these moves is the rise of virtualization software, which makes it possible to shuffle software around a data center rather than keeping it locked onto specific physical systems. the technology has eroded the boundaries between server, storage and networking hardware, forcing the large players to have a hand in all of these businesses. both oracle and sun have made their own virtualization technology in a bid to catch up with the market leader vmware. the recent uptick in the stock market may be enough for companies that had been sitting on the sideline to act. bullish analysts postulate that valuations of vulnerable tech companies will not go much lower. with $34 billion on hand, cisco has more funds at its disposal than any other technology company and has been mentioned as a suitor for storage makers like emc and netapp. h.p., too, has come up as a potential buyer for netapp. and dell has pledged to spend some of its billions on server, storage and services companies. \"i think people have been a little more fearful, but there's still a ton of cash out there,\" said peter falvey, the co-founder of revolution partners, an investment bank centered on technology companies.",

        "title": "chinese official reaffirms 'rebalancing' of economy.",
        "abstract": "beijing a senior chinese official reaffirmed on saturday a national goal of shifting china 's economy away from its dependence on investment and exports and toward a more sustainable emphasis on consumption spending. in doing so, the official, zhang ping, the chairman of the national development and reform commission , glossed over recent data that suggested the reverse might be happening. mr. zhang, whose agency oversees economic planning and coordinates the country's economic ministries, said in a news conference held in conjunction with the 18th party congress that the chinese economy was growing again, crediting government policies aimed at moving china away from its reliance on capturing an ever greater share of overseas markets for its exports. he also claimed success in easing the economy's dependence on enormous investment, which has become less efficient and less productive as many industries struggle with overcapacity. \"starting from august, the turn toward a slower economy has been effectively curbed,\" mr. zhang said. \"from the october economic data, we can see that the trend toward a rebalancing of the chinese economy is all the more obvious.\" but independent economists question whether any such conclusion is justified. china's general administration of customs announced on saturday morning that the country's trade surplus in october had soared to $32 billion, the highest level in nearly four years. exports surged 11.6 percent from a year earlier, while imports rose 2.4 percent. chinese officials are acutely conscious of the frictions that their trade surpluses create with importer nations like the united states, and have argued for many years that the surpluses are temporary and should not be an issue because they might soon disappear. president obama and mitt romney, the republican nominee, vied during the presidential election campaign over who could be tougher in trade and currency disputes with china over the next four years. commerce minister chen deming tried again on saturday to allay foreign concerns about rising chinese exports, describing the surge as unlikely to last. he said exports would probably not remain strong because of economic troubles in overseas markets and because of what mr. chen described as an international rise in protectionism . \"the trade situation will be relatively grim in the next few months,\" he said, \"and there will be many difficulties next year.\" investment has also surged rapidly this autumn , government statistics released on friday showed, as state-owned banks have lent heavily to state-owned enterprises . a series of news conferences on economic policy a third was held on saturday evening on efforts to encourage industrial innovation came as the 2,268 delegates to the party congress attended closed-door meetings on the third day of the gathering, which is held every five years. the congress is scheduled to choose a new central committee of the chinese communist party this coming week, and that committee will approve a list of leaders who are expected to run the country for the next decade. mr. zhang said in his news conference that the economy was becoming less reliant on exports and investment spending. he omitted october in citing data from 2012's first nine months that he described as showing that consumption had been playing a bigger role than investment in economic growth. he also said exports had been a drag on growth. but investment, which had slumped early this year as the government limited bank lending and restricted real estate sales to pop a housing bubble, has been bouncing back as the restrictions have been eased. exports were also very weak early this year because of europe's difficulties, but are strengthening as american demand rebounds. wang tao, a china economist at ubs in hong kong, said short-term changes in various sectors of the economy made it hard to draw any reliable conclusions about whether policy makers had been able to shift the foundations of the chinese economy onto a firmer and more sustainable footing. but she expressed skepticism that any fundamental shift had taken place so far, saying: \"these are cyclical moves. rebalancing happens very slowly.\" at the news conference on innovation, corporate executives expressed concern about china's ability to create its own inventions. but liang wengen, the president of sany heavy industry, a big construction equipment manufacturer, answered a last question on american investment policies. mr. liang is widely viewed as a well-connected industrialist with the best chance of becoming the first business tycoon to join the central committee, possibly this coming week. he bitterly criticized the obama administration on saturday evening for its decision not to allow an american company owned by sany executives to install sany-made wind turbines in or near restricted airspace next to a united states navy site where drones are developed. mr. liang promised a long legal battle against the decision, saying: \"we will fight to the end. we hope we will achieve final victory, because we believe in the justice of u.s. law, the courage of the american people and the justice of the world.\"",

        "title": "accusations of fraud at wells fargo spread to sham insurance policies.",
        "abstract": "when wells fargo admitted a few months ago that thousands of its employees had created as many as two million unauthorized accounts for its customers, alarm bells went off at prudential, one of the nation's biggest insurance firms. wells fargo has a partnership with prudential to sell a low-cost life insurance policy to the bank's retail customers. after news of the wells fargo settlement in september , prudential ordered an internal review of its dealings with the bank, to make sure nothing was amiss with the joint endeavor. a lot was amiss. according to three former managers in prudential's corporate investigation division, wells fargo employees appeared to have signed up bank customers for prudential insurance without the customers' knowledge or permission. in some cases, they even arranged for monthly premium fees to be withdrawn from their customers' accounts. when investigators reviewed tapes of calls to prudential's customer service line, they found complaints from wells fargo customers about policies they did not remember buying. many of the customers did not speak english and needed a spanish interpreter, the three plaintiffs said. \"this definitely was the same kind of conduct that wells was committing, but through prudential,\" said one of the three whistle-blowers, julie han broderick, an attorney and former co-head of prudential's corporate investigations division, which has about 30 employees. prudential wrongful termination lawsuit three managers in prudential's corporate investigation division found signs that wells fargo had signed up customers for insurance without the customers' knowledge. ms. broderick and two of her colleagues, darron smith and thomas schreck, filed a wrongful termination suit against prudential on tuesday. they say they were fired in november for trying to escalate attention internally to their discoveries about conduct at wells fargo. prudential said on friday that the three were fired for \"appropriate and legitimate reasons\" that had nothing to do with wells fargo. a prudential spokesman, scot hoffman, says the company continues to investigate the policies sold through wells fargo. once it is finished, prudential anticipates \"reviewing this matter with our regulators,\" he said. since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, wells fargo employees were encouraged, without discussing specific terms, to steer customers to either a self-service kiosk in bank branches or a website on which they could sign up for myterm, a policy that does not require applicants to take a medical exam. bankers who sold the product got credit toward their steep quarterly sales quotas. some wells fargo bankers appear to have signed people up for myterm without telling them, according to the three whistle-blowers from prudential. in some cases, bankers opened myterm policies, closed them after a month or two and then promptly reopened them to bolster their sales numbers, the evidence in the lawsuit suggests. wells fargo said in a statement on friday that it was investigating any alleged improprieties that were brought to its attention. \"as we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn't ask for, we will make it right,\" said mary eshet, a wells fargo spokeswoman. image \"this definitely was the same kind of conduct that wells was committing, but through prudential,\" said julie han broderick, a former co-head of prudential's corporate investigations division and a plaintiff in the lawsuit. credit bryan anselm for the new york times the lawsuit, filed in new jersey state court, provides elaborate details of how the same issues that have disgraced wells fargo which forced the bank to pay $185 million in fines , to account for its actions in congress , to replace its chief executive and to apologize profusely to customers are now showing up at prudential in the accounts that wells fargo handled. under intense pressure to meet sales goals , which have since been eliminated, thousands of wells fargo's workers used customers' personal information to create sham accounts in the customers' names; some incurred fees on those unwanted accounts, which included checking accounts and credit cards. more than 5,000 employees have been fired, and an internal investigation is underway. the three people who filed the wrongful termination suit were part of an investigations unit at prudential that was asked to comb for irregularities in the 15,000 myterm accounts that were sold through wells fargo. those in the unit found that some customers who signed up for myterm listed addresses like \"wells fargo drive\" on their applications, according to the complaint. some of the policy applications listed suspicious email addresses for customers, and the name listed on a policy sometimes did not match the name in the customer's email address \"for example, where the myterm policy holder was jason smith, the email address might be for <email>,\" the complaint said. additionally, the lawsuit said, \"cellphone numbers were listed as emails, such as <email>, which was very similar to how fraudulent bank accounts were opened at wells fargo bank.\" the myterm policies were \"sold predominantly to individuals with hispanic-sounding last names concentrated in southern california, southern texas, southern arizona and southern florida,\" the lawsuit states. those four states also accounted for the bulk of the sham accounts created by wells fargo's employees, according to the bank's disclosures. \"when we started peeling back the onion, everywhere we looked, it stunk,\" said mr. smith, a plaintiff, who earlier this year was a featured speaker at a conference focusing on insurance fraud. an unusually high rate of the prudential policies that wells fargo sold in its first year had lapsed 70 percent and many were dropped after only one or two months. in some cases, customers never made a single premium payment. there was also a suspicious pattern of myterm policies being closed and reopened, suggesting the unseen hand of a banker trying to buoy sales numbers. for example, \"18 clients who purchased the myterm policies allowed them to lapse, or they were canceled and then repurchased them two more times,\" the lawsuit states. a former wells fargo employee said the bank made no secret that it wanted employees to push various insurance products. \"we were like insurance salespeople without the license,\" said michael barborek, a former wells fargo banker in orange, tex. \"they wanted us to offer it to everybody who came in.\" to meet their sales goals, some bankers in his branch would sometimes buy cheap policies for their friends and relatives, pay the first month's premium and then cancel, according to mr. barborek a blatant violation of regulatory rules and wells fargo's own policies. managers, facing their own pressure to make numbers, looked the other way, he said. image thomas schreck, the third plaintiff in the suit against prudential. credit bryan anselm for the new york times the life insurance product is quick and easy to buy: a customer can complete the application in 15 minutes by answering a few basic medical questions online, without ever speaking to a licensed insurance sales agent. prudential then, with the permission of the applicant, checks databases, such as pharmaceutical records, to assess the health of an applicant before deciding to issue a policy. the average annual premium is $288.71 for a policy sold through wells fargo, which continues to offer myterm. according to the prudential employees' lawsuit, one person who contacted prudential appeared to have had funds removed from his wells fargo savings account by a bank employee to pay for a policy he said he had not authorized. and others who called prudential were confused about how much they owed each month in premiums, and why. as is not uncommon with whistle-blower cases, the three employees did not have entirely clean slates at prudential. they said prudential told them it was putting them on unpaid leave after another employee had turned over a series of text messages, most more than a year old, in which they were complaining about others within the corporate investigations division. they contend that the text messages are being used as a pretext by the company to dismiss them for complaining about the handling of the myterm investigation. mr. hoffman, the prudential spokesman, said that the termination of the three employees was \"entirely unrelated to prudential's business with wells fargo and prudential's decision to examine the sale of the myterm product.\" he declined to elaborate on the reason for the firings, noting that prudential does not comment on employment matters. mr. hoffman said that prudential began reviewing issues with myterm sales after complaints from customers in 2015, and expanded the review after news of the wells fargo settlement with regulators became public. before they were fired, ms. broderick said, she and her two colleagues ran into obstacles when they pressed others at the insurer, which is based in new jersey, to investigate their findings more aggressively and to notify regulators. they were kicked out of prudential's office in newark, n.j., and put on unpaid leave just days before thanksgiving, she said. \"we were totally shocked,\" ms. broderick said. \"the game plan was to sweep this under the rug.\" in addition to the suit they filed in state superior court in new jersey's essex county, the three intend to file a dodd-frank whistle-blower complaint next week with the securities and exchange commission, said one of their lawyers, christopher chang, a former manhattan prosecutor.",

        "title": "apple may be aiming to makeover tv next.",
        "abstract": "heard of apple tv? a lot of people have not. that is because even though steven p. jobs helped upend so many businesses with a string of groundbreaking products in music , mobile phones, games and tablet computers, he barely made a dent in television. under mr. jobs, apple dipped its toe only slightly into the television business with apple tv, a set-top box for accessing internet video. that product has been one of the rare disappointments in its lineup, especially when compared with smashes like the iphone and ipad . but many in the tech industry contend that television is ripe for technological makeover, and that the next big challenge for apple, after the death of mr. jobs, is likely to be in that area. \"it's the big area they haven't colonized,\" said james mcquivey, an analyst at forrester research . \"it's the thing we spend more of our time on than sleep.\" in the meantime, companies like microsoft have started to take a stronger leadership role in helping to push the technology of television forward, as apple did in areas like music and mobile phones. television is such a tantalizing target in part because people spend so many hours watching it, but also because the industry over all has been slow to innovate except perhaps in making screens larger. in particular, the consuming public is still waiting for television content everything that people watch to be delivered over the internet in a convenient, affordable package on all the devices people are now using. one big reason for apple's failure to gain traction in television is that apple tv has not had a compelling source of television and movie content that allows the product to stand out. although the company's itunes store is stocked with many popular shows like \"glee\" and \"sons of anarchy,\" network and movie studio executives have hesitated to make all of their content widely available at attractive prices, in large part over concerns about angering cable companies, a big source of their revenue, and their pipeline into living rooms. in august, apple discontinued an itunes rental service that allowed viewers to rent television episodes for 99 cents through the store for watching on devices like apple tv, saying that consumers were not as interested in renting episodes as in buying them. last year, talks between apple and television executives, including nbcuniversal, viacom and discovery, stalled over a plan to license their programs for an internet subscription service akin to netflix and hulu plus, according to executives briefed on talks. the cold shoulder to apple from television executives is a stark contrast to the success mr. jobs had in wooing the music companies when the itunes store was begun eight years ago. at the time, mr. jobs used his personal charisma to persuade record executives to let apple sell songs for 99 cents each through itunes. it also helped him that the ipod hadn't yet turned into a blockbuster product. the subsequent explosion in sales of 99-cent digital singles on itunes further eroded compact disc sales, many music executives say. television executives were determined to avoid the same experience. \"it didn't work in tv and movies precisely because it did in music,\" said mr. mcquivey of forrester research. mr. jobs himself often downplayed apple tv's impact on the market. while he used lofty words like \"magical\" to describe the ipad, mr. jobs on more than one occasion referred to the $99 apple tv as a \"hobby\" for apple because of its lackluster sales. analysts estimate the company has sold about two million of the devices. it has sold nearly 29 million ipads since the product was introduced in the spring of 2010. in an on-stage interview last year at the d: all things digital conference, mr. jobs further expounded on his pessimism about the market by saying that it was hard to sell innovative television devices like apple tv to consumers, when cable companies give their customers a set-top box for little or no cost upfront. \"that pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because nobody's willing to buy a set-top box,\" he said. in the meantime, one of apple's rivals, microsoft, announced a major new push into the television business on wednesday, before the announcement of mr. jobs's death. the company said it was entering a partnership with nearly 40 television providers, including bravo, comcast , hbo and verizon fios, that will allow the 35 million members of its xbox live online service to watch mainstream cable programming through microsoft's game console. the one big catch is that xbox users will still need to pay their regular monthly television bills to their cable providers to watch the television programming on their game consoles. but executives contend that the partnership could still make viewers happy because the xbox is so much friendlier to use than a cable programming guide when searching for things to watch. even if apple tv has not worked yet, apple is still having an impact on television watching through its mobile devices. after the winter olympics in vancouver last year nbcuniversal studied how viewers watched the games. network researchers noticed a fundamentally different way users of iphones watched; they preferred easily accessible clips and highlights, rather than long, elaborately produced broadcasts. that behavior has since expanded to ipad users and affected the way networks deliver live events. \"every one of those devices very, very quickly went mainstream,\" said alan wurtzel, president of research and media development for nbcuniversal. the exception was apple tv, which mr. wurtzel says was \"a year or two ahead of its time.\" \"apple tv will be among the major players in that world, except, i want to be clear, from a business standpoint there could be others to take on that role whether it's amazon or netflix,\" mr. wurtzel said. apple tv, while still niche, has fared better than others like google tv, said michael gartenberg, research director overseeing consumer technology at gartner inc. \"we see a lot of experimentation in the tv space and they'll eventually get it right,\" he said. part of the problem for apple is that a television is not just another screen in the home. viewers have a personal relationship with television. networks view it as the last place to preserve their right to present shows on a given night and charge advertisers a premium. \"it's not a question of kinks in terms of getting the technology to work but working to get the content,\" mr. gartenberg said.",

        "abstract": "albuquerque the 911 call to the albuquerque police on march 16, 2014, sounded routine: a man had been illegally camping in the foothills of the sandia mountains, just 100 yards from the caller's backyard. could an officer come by and take him away? but the man refused to comply. officers arrived in waves, a handful at first, then more of them, bringing stun guns on their belts, rifles on their shoulders and dogs by their leashes. the man, james boyd, seemed angry, incoherent. he was wielding two knives , and when officers ordered him to drop them, mr. boyd bellowed, \"don't attempt to give me, the department of defense, another directive.\" four hours into the standoff, two police officers fired six shots at mr. boyd, hitting him in the back and arms. on monday, they will stand trial on charges of second-degree murder and, their lawyers said, both will testify in their own defense. the prosecution of keith sandy, who has retired since the shooting, and dominique perez, who was fired after his indictment, is only the latest against police officers accused of killing civilians while on duty. two other trials are underway, in norfolk, va., and monroe, la. , for the killings of men who were homeless or mentally ill, as was mr. boyd. last month in portsmouth, va., an officer was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for fatally shooting an unarmed man in a case that fits a more familiar narrative: the officer was white and the suspect was black. mr. boyd was white; the officers who shot him were white and hispanic. about 1,000 times a year, an on-duty police officer shoots and kills somebody in the united states, according to an analysis by philip m. stinson , an associate professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university in ohio, using numbers from the justice department and the centers for disease control and prevention. the vast majority of the shootings were deemed justified: since 2005, when dr. stinson began his analysis, only 75 officers were charged with murder or manslaughter. of those, 26 were convicted. \"these used to be local stories, quite often,\" dr. stinson said. \"now, these cases are making national and international headlines, and people from all walks of life are paying close attention.\" one reason is video, which has transformed average citizens into arbiters and participants as they watch the action as it unfolds, unfiltered, on their cellphones and laptop screens. in the case of mr. boyd, it was video footage captured by a resident and by cameras worn by officers that showed portions of the encounter and the shooting itself. an officer's body camera registered more than two hours of the confrontation, including the many attempts to get mr. boyd to comply. image a screen grab from video taken by an albuquerque police body camera showed the standoff between james boyd and police officers before he was shot. credit albuquerque police department, via associated press at times the officers tried to humor mr. boyd, and called him \"bro\" and \"dude.\" other times, they pretended to buy into mr. boyd's wild claims that he worked for the department of defense, or that he was on a mission with special forces and could kill all of them with a phone call. then there are the images captured by mr. perez's helmet camera , which offers a clear, unobstructed view of the shooting from the officer's vantage point. together, the videos directly contradicted the version of events given by the albuquerque police department immediately after the shooting, which is that the officers had fired at mr. boyd as he threatened a colleague with knives. instead, the video showed mr. boyd turning his back to the officers. the special prosecutor, randi mcginn, has called the shooting a case of \"officer-induced jeopardy,\" saying that the police cannot pick a fight, end it with bullets and then claim self-defense. jurors will see much of that footage during the trial. what they will not see is what happened immediately after mr. boyd was shot an officer siccing a dog on him and another firing beanbag shots at him as he lay on the ground, wounded judge alisa hadfield has ruled, to avoid influencing jurors. they will also have to decide the fate of two men with different pasts. mr. perez served two tours in iraq with the united states marine corps, receiving a purple heart after his convoy was hit by an improvised explosive. mr. sandy was fired from the new mexico state police for timecard fraud he was moonlighting as a tactical instructor while on the clock before the albuquerque police department hired him in 2007. at the time of the shooting, mr. sandy was part of the police department's repeat offender project, a tactical unit with specialized weapons. the team was disbanded when the justice department released a scathing assessment of the police here one month after mr. boyd's shooting, accusing officers of routinely violating people's constitutional rights through an excessive use of force. \"before the boyd shooting, the problems in the police department just didn't get the attention they deserved,\" said steven robert allen , the policy director for the american civil liberties union of new mexico and a member of apd forward, a coalition of groups seeking changes in the albuquerque police department. \"the visceral impact of the shooting and the video really galvanized the reform effort,\" mr. allen said. \"it was a major factor in keeping the conversation going and pushing them toward reform.\" between 2010 and 2014, city police officers fatally shot 23 people and wounded 14 others, according to the justice department assessment. that amounts to four deadly shootings per 100,000 residents, eight times the rate of deadly police shootings in new york city during the same period. officers were also found to have kicked, punched and violently restrained nonthreatening people, including many with mental illnesses. mr. boyd, who had been given a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, spent much of his adult life on the streets, in jail and in psychiatric hospitals, tormented by delusions and voices inside his head. he had been arrested after punching, kicking and throwing chairs at the police and corrections officers, though never for carrying a firearm. his family settled a federal civil suit against the city last year for $5 million.",

        "title": "council weighs hearings on mayor's hiring habits.",
        "abstract": "the new york city council is considering holding oversight hearings into racial and gender diversity at the top levels of mayor michael r. bloomberg 's administration, according to council members. council members said the prospect of hearings stemmed from an article in the new york times on tuesday analyzing diversity in the bloomberg administration. the article found that in a city in which the non-hispanic white population is now 35 percent, mr. bloomberg presides over an administration in which more than 70 percent of the top senior jobs are held by whites, and roughly 60 percent are held by men. councilwoman deborah rose, chairwoman of the civil rights committee, said that the article reminded her of a 2008 village voice article, which found mr. bloomberg's record lacking in hiring minority contractors. as a result, \"the mayor is called upon yet again,\" she said, \"to answer for his continuing poor record on minority hiring and contracting.\" it was not clear when the hearings might take place. but ms. rose added: \"having recently brought in three out-of-town, white males as deputy mayors, the mayor has once again shown an indifference to living up to his own vows to bring diversity to his administration. in 2010, we must do more to ensure greater opportunities for all citizens.\" mr. bloomberg had no public events on tuesday. he declined through a spokesman to comment on the article. but based on more than 200 comments posted on the times' web site, plus interviews with current and former officials on tuesday, mr. bloomberg's diversity record exposed raw feelings, both critical and supportive of the mayor. councilwoman letitia james of brooklyn was attending the annual dinner of the metropolitan black bar association on monday night at which attorney general eric h. holder jr. was the keynote speaker when she saw the article posted online. after she showed several lawyers the article, she said, \"some people were shocked.\" \"i have attended a number of similar events ranging from hispanic to asian bar association, to the c.p.a.'s of color, to the journalists of color, to the m.b.a.'s of color, and their pedigrees range from harvard to howard universities,\" ms. james said. \"if i can find all of these qualified professionals, why can't this administration do the same?\" ms. james, who has long been critical of the mayor's diversity record, said on tuesday that she discussed the possibility of council hearings with both senior council staff and other members. comptroller john c. liu, the first asian-american elected to citywide office, said that those who defended mr. bloomberg's record as an example of meritorious hiring practices missed the point. \"in a city of 8.4 million people, at some point the law of large numbers kicks in, and it's just not legitimate to say, 'oh, this is only on the merits,' because it somehow implies that there's a lack of skill or talent in certain communities, and that is just absolutely not true and unacceptable,\" mr. liu said. \"nobody is talking about political correctness; this is about looking for skills and talent everywhere in the city and not limiting the places you go to look for this talent.\" but others were willing to give mr. bloomberg the benefit of the doubt. \"it's a constant struggle,\" said former mayor edward i. koch. \"you say to yourself, as i know bloomberg does, that the first thing i want to do, particularly in difficult times, is to get the best people who can do a good job, irrespective of whether they are green, white, hispanic or asian.\" kenneth j. knuckles, a former commissioner in the dinkins administration who is now chief executive officer of the upper manhattan empowerment zone, said that he believed that mr. bloomberg's commitment to diversity was genuine. he also said that he was consulted regularly by top bloomberg officials for candidate suggestions, especially minorities, but that recruitment was sometimes hard because government does not pay as well as the private sector, among other factors. \"you have to look long and hard it's not as easy as one would think to find highly qualified minority candidates,\" mr. knuckles said. \"i think they want to do it, but obviously they haven't gone far enough.\" one person who knows a lot about diversity, but wasn't talking on tuesday, was city council speaker christine c. quinn. ms. quinn presides over a legislative body that is more than 50 percent minority, and she has been full-throated in celebrating the council's diversity. but she declined to comment on whether she felt mr. bloomberg, a close ally, had failed in his diversity efforts. \"i think individual elected officials have to speak to their own hiring status and hiring practices,\" she said. \"so i don't really have any comment on that.\" then, asked whether diversity would be a priority in a potential quinn administration should she run for mayor, as is speculated, in 2013, she joked, \"i'm not going to be tricked into some question that says i'm running for mayor,\" before ending her press conference with, \"bye!\"",

        "title": "fleas' spectacular jumps start at their 'feet,' study shows.",
        "abstract": "one moment, the 10 fleas were happily sucking blood from hedgehogs being treated at tiggywinkles wildlife hospital in aylesbury, which, of course, is in england. the next, they were being plucked from their comfortable home and transported to cambridge, where they ended up in a glass box with a styrofoam floor. from time to time, bright lights would flood the box, so that a high-speed camera could film them. and the fleas did what fleas do in times of crisis: they jumped. when fleas jump, it is no ordinary leap. the insects can shoot as high as 38 times their body length, about three inches. and the acceleration is so intense that fleas have to withstand 100 gs, or 100 times the force of gravity. \"you and i pass out if we experience five gs,\" said malcolm burrows, an expert on insect jumping at the university of cambridge. dr. burrows and his cambridge colleague gregory sutton obtained the fleas from tiggywinkles to try to answer a question that had vexed naturalists for centuries: how fleas manage their spectacular jumps. in a paper published thursday in the journal of experimental biology , they report that the insects turn themselves into catapults, storing up energy that they release as they push off the ground with what passes, in fleas, for feet. dr. burrows and dr. sutton are only the latest in a long line of naturalists who have pondered these insects. in 1664, the british physicist robert hooke put a flea under a microscope for the first time. hooke thought the wingless fleas jumped with all six legs. \"these six leggs he clitches up altogether, and when he leaps, springs them all out, and thereby exerts his whole strength at once,\" hooke wrote. since it takes about a thousandth of a second for a flea to hurl itself into the air, hooke was obviously making a tremendous guess. it took three centuries for scientists to gather the first hard data about jumping fleas. in the 1960s, eric lucey, a biologist at the university of edinburgh, filmed the insect with what was then the most advanced high-speed camera, at a thousand frames a second. dr. lucey showed the film to henry bennet-clark, an expert on insects who was also at the university of edinburgh at the time. dr. bennet-clark realized that the fleas were generating a hundred times more power than their muscles could actually provide. he noticed that just before leaping, the flea bends the closest segment of its hindmost legs toward the body for about a tenth of a second. when dr. bennet-clark dissected fleas, he discovered that their leg muscles were connected to pads of stretchy protein called resilin. in 1967, dr. bennet-clark and dr. lucey proposed that the fleas stored energy in springlike tissues, which they then released. in 1972, another british naturalist, miriam rothschild, published a similar study and came to much the same conclusion. but ms. rothschild and dr. bennet-clark disagreed about how the force from the spring actually lifted the flea off the ground. ms. rothschild argued that fleas planted a kneelike joint called the trochanter to jump. dr. bennet-clark, on the other hand, thought the fleas pushed off from the footlike segments at the end of the legs, called the tarsi. unfortunately, their films were too blurry to determine who was right. in 2009, dr. burrows reread the original papers and decided it was time to attack the question anew, using 21st-century technology. over the course of a week, dr. sutton filmed 51 jumps, which were then analyzed on a computer. the scientists noticed that the fleas sometimes jumped with trochanters and tarsi both planted on the styrofoam. but sometimes only the tarsi made contact. \"these two jumps appear to be the same,\" said dr. sutton. it seemed that, as dr. bennet-clark had argued, only the tarsi mattered. and dr. sutton and dr. burrows got the same result when they developed mathematical models of the forces produced in flea jumps. the actual jumps matched dr. bennet-clark's hypothesis. so it seems that fleas leap by channeling their stored energy down to the tips of their legs. \"their work is pretty bulletproof,\" said steven vogel, an expert in biomechanics at duke university. dr. sutton and dr. burrows suspect that flea springs are more complex than originally thought. they've studied another jumping insect, the froghopper, and found that its resilin pads are layered over hard cuticle. this sandwich structure stores lots of energy, while the stretchy resilin keeps the hard cuticle from cracking. the scientists suspect fleas use the same biomechanical trick. dr. sutton thinks that superior springs are just one of several important lessons fleas can teach engineers. they might also learn how to build robots that can leap over rough terrain. \"insect jumping is incredibly precise and incredibly fast,\" said dr. sutton. \"if you could build a robot that could do that, it would be fantastic.\" but dr. sutton acknowledged that some of the most important secrets of fleas remain to be worked out. no one knows how fleas lock their springs in place and then release them, for instance. and no one knows how fleas snap their two rear hindmost legs at the same time. if they weren't so precise, the insects would spin wildly off course. \"if you're half a millisecond off, you're done, and we have no idea how they do it,\" dr. sutton said. \"it's one step at a time we're just going have to take on the next problem and solve that.\"",

        "title": "japanese pilots worry about repaired boeing 787 jets.",
        "abstract": "tokyo as boeing's 787 dreamliner returns to the skies, japanese pilots are nervous about whether they would receive enough warning about any hazards with the jetliner's new battery system. toshikazu nagasawa, the director at the air line pilots' association of japan, said on tuesday that some pilots remained concerned about the changes boeing made to the 787's lithium-ion batteries after two incidents involving smoke or fire led to the grounding of the fleet early this year. mr. nagasawa said the pilots were also dismayed that boeing did not adjust its cockpit displays to provide more substantial alerts if the batteries started to overheat. boeing officials acknowledged in interviews that they had not expanded the alerts. but they said the new battery system virtually eliminated the chance of fire or any risk to the plane. safety regulators in the united states and japan, and the eight airlines flying the jets, have signed off on the changes. two japanese airlines, all nippon airways and japan airlines, own 27 of the 57 dreamliners now in service. officials at each airline said they trusted the battery repairs, and a japan airlines spokesman said the airline was still trying to assuage the pilots' concerns. the two battery incidents, both in mid-january, involved a fire on a japan airlines 787 parked in boston and a smoking battery that forced an all nippon jet to make an emergency landing in japan. regulators in the united states and japan have still not pinpointed the cause of the problems, though it is clear that the fire on the boston plane started with a short circuit that spread through all eight of the cells on one of the plane's batteries. to get the planes back in the air, boeing changed the battery manufacturing process to reduce the chances for a short circuit and added better insulation to keep a short in one cell from spreading. it also added a stainless steel box to encase the batteries and minimize the chances of a fire. and, as a last resort, it created titanium tubing to vent any hazardous residue from the plane. \"boeing says that any battery fire will now go out on its own, so there's no safety issue,\" mr. nagasawa, the japanese pilots' union leader, said in an interview. \"but that's on paper. no pilot would ever want to keep flying with a fire on board, whether it's in a metal box or not.\" image an all nippon airways worker checked the door of a battery room on a repaired boeing 787 dreamliner last week. credit kimimasa mayama/european pressphoto agency mike sinnett, a boeing vice president and the chief project engineer for the 787, said in an interview that the metal case would minimize the amount of oxygen near the battery to prevent a fire. boeing also received support tuesday from the air line pilots association in the united states. \"a.l.p.a. is very satisfied with the b787 product improvements, and we have not heard any concerns from our members,\" the union said in a statement. the japanese pilots first expressed their concerns in meetings with boeing engineers in tokyo in late march. several pilots from all nippon airways raised about 30 safety concerns, according to a written account provided by the union. other more recent problems with the planes have added to the worries and irritated japanese officials. a loose fastener on an electrical panel caused a small part of that panel to char last month, though that occurred on a test flight without paying customers. on sunday, two days after the japanese airlines resumed 787 passenger flights, a sensor that detects uneven pressures near the batteries malfunctioned on one jet, forcing japan airlines to change planes for a flight to beijing. mr. sinnett said both problems were caused by maintenance errors by boeing personnel. but akihiro ota, the japanese transport minister, rebuked boeing and japan airlines on tuesday for the latest blunder. that the companies \"failed to take all possible safety measures is deplorable,\" mr. ota told reporters. the 787 carries two lithium-ion batteries. the main battery provides backup power for the cockpit displays. the other battery starts a small engine that provides power to the plane on the ground. according to the memorandum describing the meeting with boeing in march, the japanese pilots expressed concern that they would receive only a general warning of a battery malfunction, with no indication of its severity. the pilots were also worried about whether boeing had provided enough proof that the jets could fly safely if the batteries failed. mr. sinnett said on tuesday that the planes had multiple backup systems and could still fly if the batteries failed. he said the cockpit alerts were ranked in descending order by urgency as warnings, cautions, advisories or status notices. he said that various problems with the batteries would only set off an advisory or status alert. he added that the airlines had not asked boeing to upgrade the alert system.",

        "title": "new jersey: analysts say home prices rose little, if at all.",
        "abstract": "after many years of double-digit appreciation in residential real estate around new jersey , home values did not rise significantly last year and may have slipped, according to real estate market analysts. while the new jersey association of realtors says the median home price climbed 2 percent, another industry analyst says it actually fell 10 percent. whether there has been a correction or not, everyone agrees on some things: the years of rapid housing inflation are over, but there has been no crash. and houses are selling now, especially at the more affordable end of the spectrum. \"we're seeing things under $300,00 or $400,000 starting to move again,\" said bill hanley, president of the state realtors association. \"the days of double-digit appreciation are over, but there are still multiple offers on homes when they are priced right.\" jeffrey g. otteau, the president of the otteau appraisal group inc., an east brunswick company that studies industry trends for real estate agents, said his analysis, which matches comparable segments of the market over time, indicates that prices have dropped substantially in 2006. he said the realtors association overstates the actual market prices in the current year because it fails to account for the larger size of newer homes. \"what we experienced was not a crash, but an adjustment of about 10 percent, which was needed to bring affordability back into balance,\" mr. otteau said. \"the housing market has now begun its recovery.\" mr. hanley, manager of weichert realtors in metuchen, and mr. otteau each said there were large inventories in more expensive price ranges over $600,000 that would take a year or more to work off at the present rate of sales. but in lower price ranges, homes have sold more briskly, they said. \"you'll find you had more appreciation in central and south jersey, where the more affordable homes are,\" mr. hanley said. mr. otteau predicted that even with sales picking up, the rapid appreciation of prices that was seen in recent years would not resume. \"although the recovery has now begun, prices will remain at or near current levels, and won't increase anytime soon,\" because the unsold inventory will keep supply above demand, he said. the trends in new jersey are similar to those in the rest of the suburban region. on long island, the median home price dropped in nassau county and rose slightly in suffolk in january, compared with a year earlier. in westchester county, the median price dropped 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with the same period a year earlier, and sales volume was down considerably as well. p. gilbert mercurio, chief executive officer of the westchester county board of realtors, said he expected prices to remain flat for at least the next two quarters. on long island, pearl kamer, the chief economist for the long island association, a business group, said she expected prices would continue to fall through 2008 before resuming modest appreciation of 2 to 3 percent.",

        "abstract": "st. petersburg, russia president dmitri a. medvedev set out on friday to woo overseas investors at his country's largest foreign investment forum, a sharp contrast to previous years. at past meetings of the st. petersburg international economic forum, mr. medvedev assailed the dollar as a global currency, and his predecessor, vladimir v. putin, criticized the international monetary fund as a tool of developed nations. but on friday, mr. medvedev described in the most detail yet an emerging policy to diversify russia 's economy away from oil by developing a high-technology sector with foreign investment. a need to maintain close ties with western countries and businessmen to attract technology and expertise has been a recurring theme recently for his presidency. a foreign-policy document leaked to the russian version of newsweek recently raised arguments for improving ties with the united states and european union with the goal of easing technology transfer to russia. on friday, mr. medvedev said he had good news for the chief executives gathered at the forum and described how russia would seek to improve the climate for foreign investments. \"we changed,\" mr. medvedev said. economic diversification has been a top priority for russia, the world's largest energy-exporting nation, since its oil-dependent economy faltered in the autumn of 2008, though there have been few results so far. what is new is the policy of linking the goals of diversification and modernization with improved access for foreign investors. \"creating a comfortable climate for investors is essentially our most important task,\" mr. medvedev said. \"these are the goals of our modernization.\" mr. medvedev said russia would cut capital gains taxes, reform white-collar criminal law and privatize state enterprises, all to make the country more attractive to investors in sectors other than the boom-and-bust oil and mining industries. the government, he said, would reduce the number of wholly owned state companies to 159 from 230, though this reform would not cover the largest state companies like gazprom because they already had private shareholders. mr. medvedev noted changes in legislation requiring prosecutorial oversight of police enforcement of financial crime, apparently intended to curb widespread police corruption. \"russia should become an attractive country,\" mr. medvedev said. \"people from around the world will go here in search of their dreams and search for better opportunities for success and self-fulfillment.\" mr. medvedev, a former law professor and corporate lawyer, has shown a greater inclination to foster private business than his predecessor, who is now prime minister. mr. putin oversaw a partial nationalization of the oil industry and is still the final arbiter of economic policy. as if to underscore that point, mr. putin announced on friday new supports for the domestic banking sector and, while visiting factories in a rust-belt area of russia, suggested he would help them by reviewing import duties on heavy machinery. all the same, businessmen greeted mr. medvedev's sunny speech as a welcome pitch to foreign investors from a government known more for its cold shoulder, made plausible by the government's need for an infusion of expertise in running technology enterprises. \"international investors are engaging, and being engaged,\" darrell stanaford, the director in russia for cb richard ellis, the global real estate firm, said.",

        "title": "two little league world series teams buck trend.",
        "abstract": "south williamsport, pa. chicago defeated philadelphia, 6-5 , on thursday night in a game that had implications from little league to the big leagues. the matchup featured an increasingly rare occurrence a prevalence of black players in a sport in which urban youth participation has been in decline and professional rosters have become sparsely populated by african-americans. most immediately, jackie robinson west of chicago ended the captivating run of the taney dragons of philadelphia and their star, mo'ne davis, in the little league world series. chicago earned a spot in the united states title game against las vegas, scheduled for saturday. in a larger sense, with baseball seeking to broaden its appeal, thursday's game was viewed by officials and coaches as a showcase for what is possible if sufficient opportunity and instruction are provided to urban players. taney was the first philadelphia team to reach the little league world series. jackie robinson west is participating for the first time since 1983. davis, who is black and who last friday became the first girl to pitch a shutout in the tournament, has become a national figure of inspiration. an african-american player has not been so celebrated at the youth series perhaps since lloyd mcclendon, now the manager of the seattle mariners, hit five home runs in five official at-bats in 1971 while playing for gary, ind., earning him the nickname legendary lloyd. at a news conference here wednesday, rob manfred, the commissioner-elect of major league baseball, said that while his position required a certain neutrality, he had rooted for the racially diverse philadelphia team and the all-black chicago team to meet in the little league world series. \"we think it's crucial to commit resources, energy, time to the development of the game, particularly in the inner cities,\" manfred said. the racial and socioeconomic diversity of philadelphia's team, in particular, \"sends a message that baseball is a wide-open sport,\" manfred said. he added, \"it's a great sport for people from all sorts of backgrounds.\" yet as the 2014 season opened, only 8.3 percent of major league players were african-american, according to the league. that is a drop from a high of 19 percent of players in 1986, according to the society of american baseball research. many theories have been proposed to explain the dwindling participation of young players in urban areas: a lack of space, a dearth of organized programs to replace the lost traditions of sandlot ball and street games, the small number of college scholarships available, the expense of buying equipment and playing in elite travel leagues. when bats cost $300 and gloves sell for $150, baseball is not an option for many children, barry larkin, a hall of fame shortstop, said on a recent espn telecast of the little league world series. yankees pitcher c. c. sabathia recently told the new york times that the tradition of children playing catch with their fathers was difficult to sustain in one-parent households. \"it's hard to get kids to play,\" he said. image philadelphia's taney dragons received praise from rob manfred, m.l.b.'s commissioner-elect. credit brett carlsen for the new york times martha ackmann, a professor of gender studies at mount holyoke college, said the promotional appeal of baseball as a nostalgic sport had contributed to a lack of racial and gender diversity. \"if we keep looking back to the good old days, we're not looking forward,\" ackmann, who has written widely about baseball, said in a telephone interview. so how does baseball become more inclusive? first, some misconceptions should be addressed, said steve bandura, an official with philadelphia's parks and recreation department who helped develop a successful sports league in the city for baseball, basketball and soccer. it is not accurate, bandura said, that african-americans lack an interest in baseball, find it too slow and prefer basketball and football because they provide more ready access to scholarships and professional careers. \"kids are all the same,\" said bandura, who has coached davis, philadelphia's star pitcher, since she was 7. \"if you give them something to do that they like, they're going to keep doing it. there just aren't enough quality, structured programs in our inner cities.\" suburban children often begin playing at 5 years old, participate in 50 to 100 games a year on travel teams and train year-round, bandura said; urban players often start at 10 or 12 and have little opportunity to travel or to train in the off-season. currently, bandura said, most urban youths have \"zero chance\" of competing with suburban players. in 1999, little league started an urban initiative that it says has created 200 leagues in 90 cities and has given 52,000 children a chance to play baseball. major league baseball has also implemented a number of initiatives. but in an extensive proposal sent to the league last year, bandura said the programs were too focused on participation and public relations instead of identifying and developing raw talent into top-level stars, as is done with baseball in the dominican republic and is done widely with soccer. bandura proposed a hub-and-spoke system involving an urban youth academy in each big-league city. the academies would be operated by the scouting and development departments of pro teams. talent would come from neighborhood leagues, be nurtured at local training centers and be instructed by paid staff members and certified coaches instead of volunteers. \"with the rapidly changing demographics in the united states, it is imperative that major league baseball be proactive in reaching out to and developing these new markets,\" bandura wrote. on thursday, bandura said he was encouraged by the remarks of manfred, the commissioner-elect. after the game, davis consoled her teammates. \"we made it this far; there's no reason to cry or anything,\" said davis, who did not pitch thursday and went 0 for 1 at the plate. \"i pitched two games; i pitched against two great teams; i did well. that was a great journey for us.\" she posed for a photograph with chicago's marquis jackson, who pitched three innings to earn the win. the teams had cheered each other on via social media during the regionals. \"it's a nice fraternity,\" bandura said. thinking of davis, he added, \"or sorority, however you want to look at it.\"",

        "abstract": "at belmont park on saturday morning, four friends met in the same spot and at the same time on belmont stakes day as they have for years. over doughnuts and coffee at 9:30, near the tote board in the paddock, they talked about the races ahead and who among them would be the big winner. the scratch of i'll have another, as disappointing as they agreed it was, would certainly not spoil tradition. they saw a silver lining. \"i heard it on the radio and i was sad for like two minutes,\" michael washburn said, \"and then i thought, there won't be any lines at the betting windows.\" his childhood friend michael genaro nodded. pete farrell and jeff bissell laughed. they had taken their seats on the second floor of the grandstand, across from the 16th pole. the folding seats around them stayed empty for most of the day again a silver lining, as they spread their copies of the daily racing form and the program across the empty chairs. the sixth-largest crowd in belmont stakes history, 85,811, turned out even without a triple crown prospect. i'll have another's scratch was not enough to miss the biggest day in new york racing. for hard-bitten horseplayers like the four friends, however, the scratch meant the odds on his rivals would unfortunately drop. \"i would rather have seen him run,\" washburn, 46, said. \"i don't think any one of us was going to bet on him.\" genaro and washburn grew up in saratoga springs, n.y., and used to duck turnstiles at its historic racecourse and skip class to find greater excitement at off-track betting locations. farrell met genaro at iona college, and with washburn, the three began coming to belmont in 1985. bissell, 53, was introduced to the group in 2000. they have missed the belmont stakes only a few times, even as they have scattered. washburn lives outside washington; genaro in greenwich, conn.; bissell near saratoga; and farrell on long island. the group once reached a dozen but has contracted over the years. it is the four's task to keep alive the tradition. these are not fair-weather fans or show bettors. genaro, 45, who works for an online publishing company, is the encyclopedia of the group. h remembered the years they missed risen star in 1988 and a.p. indy in 1992 and was called on by his friends to remember past winners. he had small binoculars and studied the horses in the post parade. washburn, who works for an investment bank, is a self-proclaimed numbers guy and an everyday horseplayer. his friends joked that he talked enough for the whole group. they reclined in their seats and turned over stories of past triumphs. bissell hoped i'll have another would run because it recalled memories of 2003, when empire maker denied funny cide the triple crown. they had no qualms betting against the people's horse that year. \"we had empire maker every which way,\" bissell said. with two other friends who were not in attendance on saturday, bissell said, they took a town car home and went for a steak dinner in manhattan. \"the money was gone by the end of the day,\" he said with a laugh. that day, farrell, who had lost touch with the group, was there for his brother's bachelor's party and bumped into his old friends. with that, he returned to the fold. genaro, the sentimental one of the group, wore a fanny pack with ticket stubs and betting vouchers from memorable days reaching back 12 years. he rifled through it and found two admission tickets from 2003. \"that's funny cide's year,\" he said to bissell. \"you want these?\" \"no,\" bissell said, waving his program. \"i crushed funny cide. i beat him.\" as the day wore on, they walked from their seats to the tellers inside the grandstand. washburn had an eye for races from churchill downs in kentucky and monmouth park in new jersey. his friends gave him flak for this. \"i'm here to make money,\" washburn said. \"i don't have to bet on belmont only.\" they started to get hot by the fourth race at belmont. genaro chose a 12-1 shot after praising his physical condition during the post parade. in the sixth, washburn and bissell shouted themselves hoarse as their choice surged to the front at the top of the stretch. then they pooled their money for the seventh race. washburn was chosen to pick for the group. he selected a deep closer named caixa eletronica, a portuguese name that translates to \"cash machine,\" sitting at 7-2. his friends were skeptical. for most of the race their fears looked real. caixa eletronica trailed by a dozen lengths at the top of the stretch, but as the leaders weakened from a hot pace, he charged between horses and caught the leader yards from the wire. the packed crowd on the apron and in the stands erupted. \"they all made fun of me,\" washburn said as he soaked up congratulations. the four friends were jubilant. the win had looked impossible. now this, they agreed, was a memory they would recall years from now.",

        "title": "maliki wields more power in iraq after crisis.",
        "abstract": "baghdad when prime minister nuri kamal al-maliki rounded up hundreds of former baathists, accused the vice president of running a hit squad and threatened to use the apparatus of state to target other top sunni leaders, some rivals and critics said that mr. maliki's authoritarian streak had finally antagonized enough of iraq 's political class to jeopardize his hold on power. instead, mr. maliki appears to have emerged from a potentially destabilizing political crisis with even more power over the iraqi state and more popularity among his shiite constituents, many people here said. \"people trust him more and more after this,\" said rahman tal jukon, a retired businessman in hilla, a town in the shiite-dominated south where expressions of support for mr. maliki, once tepid, are now more common and enthusiastic. \"he is a brave man. he has guts.\" mr. maliki's political calculus, pushing to the edge of a full-blown crisis, appears to have paid off, though worries remain that iraq is sliding toward one-man, one-party rule under mr. maliki. his rivals among the sunnis are busy retrenching as their political leadership fractures, causing a pervasive feeling that sunnis have lost any meaningful stake in iraqi public life. in a recent report , ramzy mardini , an analyst at the institute for the study of war, wrote: \"it is clear that maliki has come out as the winner in the political crisis he provoked. he has made it more difficult for his shia rivals to dissent while simultaneously confining his sunni opponents in a position suitable for exerting pressure and exploiting divisions within their ranks.\" iraqiya, the largely sunni bloc of lawmakers that is led by a secular shiite, ayad allawi , was forced to end boycotts of parliament and the cabinet that were staged to protest mr. maliki's actions, without winning any rewards. members of the bloc have split, and some ministers refused to participate in the boycott, adding to a sense that sunni optimism after the 2010 parliamentary elections, when iraqiya won the most seats, has dissipated completely. zuhair araji, a former iraqiya member who withdrew from the party, called the boycott \"unwise\" and said the alliance had embarrassed itself. similar sentiments are heard in the capital's sunni neighborhoods. \"iraqiya came back to the parliament and the government because they failed and they have lost all their popularity in iraq,\" said aymen fakhry, who lives in adhamiya. obaida al-jobori, a sunni and a restaurant owner in the karada neighborhood of baghdad, said: \"sunnis made a big mistake when they decided not to participate in the political process with the shias and kurds. they proved sunni leaders are not experienced enough to help their people in the right manner.\" two months ago, just as the last american troops were leaving, iraq seemed at the edge of the abyss. the american ambassador cut short his vacation to rush back to baghdad. president jalal talabani returned from knee surgery in germany to mediate the crisis. the vice president and top sunni politician, tariq al-hashimi, left baghdad, running from an arrest warrant on terrorism charges. a spate of attacks wrought familiar scenes of grief and bloodshed. politically, analysts worried that the government was close to collapse and that its fracturing would start a new civil war. mr. maliki has made some concessions. local officials say many of the former baathists who were arrested late last year have been released. and to head off efforts made by sunni-dominated regions to gain more autonomy, mr. maliki has pushed for legal amendments that would give provinces more autonomy on budgets and the right of consent over when national security forces are deployed within their borders. \"there was no crisis from the beginning, but problems, you could say,\" said ali al-allaq, a member of parliament from mr. maliki's dawa party and a close adviser to the prime minister. mr. allaq, his head wrapped in a black turban as he glanced at his two iphones resting on a tabletop, described the problems as those that \"any young democracy would have.\" the overarching question for iraq is how long it can continue without genuine reconciliation before the sectarian divide leads the country back to bloodshed. while mr. maliki cemented his support among the shiite majority and neutralized rivals from his own sect, like the radical cleric moktada al-sadr, sunnis seem more adrift than ever. that is a potentially combustible set of circumstances when coupled with the chaos across the border in syria, where the country's sunni majority is battling a government whose leaders adhere to an offshoot of shiism. \"sunnis after 2003 are like fish inside a small pool with a shark,\" said mayson merza, a sunni who lives in karada. \"they can't get out, and they can't remain inside. we have a very sectarian government, which is looking to eliminate all sunnis and replace them by thieves and iranian agents out to destroy iraq and the arab nation.\" after the crisis erupted in december, analysts warned the country was on the edge of a civil war. \"there has been a rapid and widespread deterioration of security in iraq since the mid-december end of the u.s. military mission there,\" michael knights, an analyst at the washington institute for near east policy in washington, wrote this month in the national interest. after a bloody january by some accounts a deadlier month than any last year february had been on pace to be one of the least violent months since the american-led invasion nine years ago, until a series of car bomb attacks in baghdad and around the country on thursday left more than 40 people dead. the iraqi psyche, weighted by history and past grievances, still frames political issues through a simplistic sectarian lens: shiites fear the restoration of sunni power, and many sunnis who feel they are the natural leaders are beholden to their resentments over the shiite empowerment wrought by america's war. mr. jukon, the retired businessman in hilla, spoke of sunni domination from the british colonial mandate after world war i until the toppling of saddam hussein in 2003. \"that affects how some people see this,\" he said of the political crisis. ahmed al-khafaji, the deputy interior minister, a shiite whose life, like many iraqi leaders, was shaped by years in exile in iran, dismissed criticisms that the iraqi state had shut out sunnis from power. \"freedom is the most important thing,\" he said. \"here is an islamic newspaper,\" he said, waving it about. he pointed to his laptop, and his cellphone. \"now we have 600 satellite channels.\" he echoed the familiar refrain here that it will take generations to achieve a durable sectarian co-existence. \"with time, democracy will continue, and one day we will be like switzerland, or france or the italians,\" he said. \"in the united states in the 1960s, a black man couldn't get on a bus, and now obama is president.\"",

        "title": "fighting n.y.c. soda ban, industry focuses on personal choice.",
        "abstract": "lobbyists from coca-cola and other big soda companies have met with mayoral candidates and city council members. canvassers hired by the beverage industry are stopping new yorkers on the street to solicit signatures on petitions. facebook and twitter pages tell readers to \"say no to a #sodaban.\" confronting a high-profile attack on its fizzy products, the american soft-drink industry is beginning an aggressive campaign to fight new york city 's proposed restrictions on large servings of sugary drinks. hoping for a debate about freedom, not fatness, the industry has created a coalition called new yorkers for beverage choices to coordinate its public relations efforts in the city. on thursday, the group introduced its first radio spot, a one-minute advertisement featuring \"noo yawk\"-accented actors proclaiming, \"this is about protecting our freedom of choice.\" \"this is new york city; no one tells us what neighborhood to live in or what team to root for,\" says the narrator, as yankees and mets fans shout in the background. \"so are we going to let our mayor tell us what size beverage to buy?\" adds one brooklyn -tinged voice: \"it's unbelievable!\" the charge is being led by the industry's leading trade group, the washington -based american beverage association, which has retained several powerhouse political consultants for the cause, including the strategists responsible for the \"harry and louise\" television advertisements that helped defeat president bill clinton 's health care plan in the 1990s. the beverage association would not disclose its budget for the new york campaign, but eliot hoff, a spokesman for the coalition, said it was \"prepared to utilize whatever resources are necessary.\" the city has also waged a campaign to influence public opinion. since 2009 it has run five waves of advertising, in subways, in print, on the internet and on television, linking soda consumption to obesity . the campaign has cost $2.8 million, city officials said, of which 87 percent was financed by the federal government. the battle is a consequential one for the soda industry, which is on the defensive as public health officials increasingly cite sweetened beverages as a major contributor to america's runaway obesity rate. the industry has already committed tens of millions of dollars to help defeat proposed taxes and regulations on its products across the country including $13 million in albany in 2010 to successfully lobby the legislature to reject a proposed 1-cent-an-ounce state tax on sodas. but the industry has been facing even more challenges since may 30 when mayor michael r. bloomberg proposed banning the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces in regulated food establishments, including in movie theaters and sports arenas. the mayor of cambridge , mass., henrietta davis, has proposed that her city take a similar step, and senator frank r. lautenberg , a new jersey democrat, proposed a federal study of the link between sugary beverages and obesity. the industry faces a particularly tough fight in new york city, because the proposed restrictions require approval only by the board of health, whose members were appointed by mr. bloomberg. the board plans to hold a public hearing on the proposal on july 24, and the industry, as a first step, hopes to encourage opponents to show up in droves. the bloomberg administration said it was unsurprised by the industry's efforts to stymie the plan. \"there's an impartial group of health experts who are going to make the decision,\" said howard wolfson , a deputy mayor who is shepherding the proposed ban. \"i think they will be influenced by science, and not any p.r. campaign.\" soda executives are vague about their long-term strategy, saying they are focused for now on recruiting local businesses, unions and lawmakers to join their cause. but the city council speaker, christine c. quinn , and gov. andrew m. cuomo , seemingly closing the door on city or state legislative action, have said they do not wish to get involved. the industry said it was also considering a court challenge, but only after the regulatory process was completed. in recent weeks, lobbyists from coca-cola met with three likely mayoral candidates: bill de blasio , the public advocate, and scott m. stringer , the manhattan borough president, who support the proposed restrictions; and william c. thompson , a former city comptroller, who does not. the company also approached ms. quinn, another likely candidate for mayor, but has not met with her. \"this is the stuff that you would expect any industry to do,\" said christopher gindlesperger, a spokesman for the american beverage association. \"it's important, regardless of the endgame here, to make sure people understand the impact of this thing, to let them know how it will impact their daily lives.\" on june 20, representatives of soda companies, local restaurants and movie theaters all of whom oppose the mayor's plan met for an hour with four members of the city council's black, latino and asian caucus . \"there was a discussion about joining forces with the industry, and we are considering that,\" said councilwoman letitia james, who invited the industry to meet with her colleagues. she said members of her caucus mostly opposed mr. bloomberg's plan, saying the 16-ounce restriction could put a disproportionate financial burden on lower-income families and small businesses. ms. james said that she and other council members would consider filing a brief in support of any lawsuit brought by the industry. was soda served at the meeting? \"no refreshments at all,\" ms. james said, \"other than the water cooler.\" the beverage industry, like the tobacco industry before it, has cultivated relationships with minority-group lawmakers, arguing that their communities are disproportionately affected by sales regulations. \"there's one thing that all of these bans and attacks and other discriminatory proposals have in common, and that is that they're regressive,\" mr. gindlesperger said. \"they're discriminatory in that they target our products; they are regressive in that they target low- and middle-income families.\" critics of the soda industry say its new york campaign follows a familiar playbook. \"the talking points are 'nanny state,' that it won't work because people will just buy as much as they ever would, and that this disproportionately hurts the poor,\" said kelly brownell, director of the rudd center for food policy and obesity at yale university . in new york, though, some strategists questioned why the industry would spend time speaking with city council members, since the council is effectively powerless to overrule the mayor. the beverage association also learned an early lesson about mr. bloomberg's overwhelming influence around the city. last year, the group retained skd knickerbocker, an influential consulting firm that produced advertisements for mr. bloomberg's mayoral campaigns, to advise it on political strategy in new york. when a knickerbocker spokesman, speaking for the beverage industry, denounced the mayor's plan last month, mr. bloomberg's camp was taken aback, according to several people with direct knowledge of the situation. allies of mr. bloomberg conveyed their anger to the firm. the company still represents the beverage association but is no longer working on the soda-ban issue.",

        "title": "hurricane brings more worry to neighbors of oyster creek nuclear plant.",
        "abstract": "lacey, n.j. some years ago, janet tauro moved to the pine barrens and salt-flecked flats of the jersey shore, where she would raise her children. then she found that oyster creek, the nation's oldest nuclear plant, sat on her doorstep. she became a nuclear activist, one of dozens who bird-dog the oyster creek plant, and helped persuade gov. chris christie to shutter the place by 2019. but not even the closing notice set her mind at ease. then hurricane sandy blew through, spinning houses off foundations, blowing holes in barrier islands and wrecking lives. in the midst of this mayhem, oyster creek sounded a modest alarm. rising waters in barnegat bay threatened to submerge the pumps the plant uses to pull in water to cool its reactor and spent-fuel pools. had workers with exelon corporation, which owns oyster creek, been forced to turn off the water-intake pumps, they might have had to dip fire hoses into the floodwaters to refill the ever-hot pool. the plant issued an alert, the second lowest on the four-stage scale established by the nuclear regulatory commission. at the same time, 39 of 42 warning sirens, which are perched on poles for miles around the plant and intended to warn local residents in event of a nuclear emergency, lost power. ms. tauro pulled her coat tight against winter winds as she walked along a bridge within sight of the plant's smokestack; this area, she noted, was underwater on oct. 29. \"we know what the company will say: this is another 'lesson learned,' \" she said. \"but we've got 3.5 million people in a 50-mile radius of this plant, and it feels like we're sitting ducks.\" in fact, craig nesbit, a spokesman for exelon, said, \"everything went very well.\" and gordon k. hunegs, of the nuclear regulatory commission, pointedly added, \"the plant was always safe.\" \"what if\" disaster tales are a risky business; our world is filled with unrealized perils. this is particularly true of nuclear power, as it inflames our imagination and stirs primal fears. image oyster creek is the nation's oldest nuclear plant. credit stan honda/agence france-presse getty images still, the n.r.c.'s conclusion feels too tidy. oyster creek is a sometimes troubled nuclear plant. and there is the impression, built up year after empirical year, that the n.r.c. is a tiger denuded of claws. even the agency's internal monitors found it was notoriously cautious about actions that might cost plants time and money. in 2007, exelon corporation ignored corrosion in pipes used to circulate cooling waters in an illinois plant. a pipe broke. had the pipe ruptured during an emergency, experts told the new york times in 2011, there might have been a catastrophe 100 miles west of chicago. the n.r.c. handed out two low-level reprimands, akin to sending the company to its room without dinner. a couple of years later, gregory b. jaczko, a rare activist at the agency, argued that poor management of erosion in the drywall shell of the reactor at oyster creek merited closer attention. \"the company's series of errors,\" he wrote, \"provides evidence that directly contradicts exelon's ability to meet the commitments.\" the majority of the commissioners ignored him. then there are those broken sirens. exelon and the nuclear regulatory commission say not to worry; there was a back-up system. that involved sending out local deputy sheriffs in patrol cars with loudspeakers. wouldn't 85 mile-per-hour winds and washed-out roads prove problematic? \"the state has said it could have carried out that plan,\" an agency spokeswoman replied. another agency official interjected that the best move during a radiological release was to stay indoors. so mission accomplished, sort of. let's acknowledge that nuclear power is complicated. its carbon footprint is minimal. a few prominent environmentalists argue that the rapidly heating world cannot make wrenching changes without nuclear power to ease the transition. mr. nesbit of exelon argues, reasonably, that oyster creek had backup for the back-up plans. there were generators, and fire engines on trailers. but experience teaches that problems can become a stumble down a staircase. great storms blow up the coast with unnerving regularity of late. (while the n.r.c. has required oyster creek to thoroughly evaluate its flood plan in three years, it has not required exelon to look at the effect global warming will have on flood preparation.) \"this was not the big one,\" ms. tauro said. \"i get the feeling we're regulating with our fingers crossed.\"",

        "abstract": "the first 39 games of the baseball season had already taken their toll on the yankees and the mets, and the first three games of the subway series had been emotional, exhausting affairs. the mets had battered the yankees at yankee stadium, and masahiro tanaka had stifled the mets at citi field. everyone seemed a bit woozy. injuries forced both teams to start rookies in their major league debuts thursday: chase whitley for the yankees and jacob degrom for the mets. the way the first three games had gone, both teams could use an injection of youth. \"it's an exciting four days for everybody,\" mets manager terry collins said, and under his breath, barely audible, he added, \"but let's get it over with.\" degrom did all that he could, carrying the mets for seven innings. but he could not win the game alone. whitley and the yankees' bullpen combined to throw a three-hit shutout, as the yankees won, 1-0. this year's edition of the subway series ended up tied at two games apiece, and the visiting team won every game. of the mets' three hits, one belonged to degrom. he singled, breaking the mets pitchers' hitless streak to start the season, and received a standing ovation. whitley singled in his first at-bat, too. so in what was probably derek jeter's last game against the mets, these two rookie pitchers dueled and took center stage. mets fans had been awaiting degrom's debut. rafael montero, noah syndergaard and degrom were considered to the team's best pitching prospects. syndergaard was tall and powerful and nicknamed thor. montero was shorter and lithe, with pinpoint control. degrom was spindly with his distinctive long, brown hair. syndergaard is expected to join the mets later this season, and montero made his debut wednesday to rave reviews. but this was degrom's chance to prove he could start here. he would perhaps have only two starts to do so, until dillon gee returned from the disabled list, which might force degrom to the bullpen. image mets starter jacob degrom, who pitched seven innings in his debut, singled in the third for the first hit by a mets pitcher this year. credit barton silverman/the new york times as he overcame his nerves, degrom allowed four base runners over the first three innings, but he kept his composure in each situation. he ended the first by staring down mark teixeira and striking him out swinging through a high, 95-mile-per-hour fastball. he ended the second with yangervis solarte's grounding into a double play. he ended the third by calmly catching a jeter line drive and turning a double play. whitley cruised through the mets. he retired the first six batters he faced. he located his fastball, mixed in his slider, and then unleashed his changeup. he struck out david wright on a fastball that appeared off the plate. he allowed his first hit in the third, when ruben tejada and degrom singled. the mets pitchers had started the season 0 for 64 at the plate, which set a record. sandy alderson, the mets' general manager, had called it an \"embarrassing statistic,\" the \"proverbial elephant in the room\" anytime one of their pitchers came to bat. with one swing, in his first career at-bat, degrom had ended the mets' misery. whitley escaped the jam, retiring eric young jr. and striking out daniel murphy. but after walking two batters in the fifth, whitley was pulled. he had thrown only 74 pitches, holding the mets scoreless and to only two hits over four and two-thirds innings. \"after i got a couple of innings under my belt, i just told myself to remember i'm just playing the same game i played since i was 5 years old,\" whitley said. the mets were content to ride degrom as long as they could. after the third, he retired the next 10 yankees. at one stretch, over the fifth and sixth innings, he strung together four strikeouts in five batters. his third time through the order, degrom walked teixeira on five pitches. even then, he got brian mccann to hit a ground ball into the shift, but wright could not turn the double play at second base. the next batter, alfonso soriano, ripped a double to the gap, bringing in mccann from first. that was degrom's lone blemish. he needed only 91 pitches to go seven innings, holding the yankees to four hits and that lone run. he registered six strikeouts and issued only two walks. \"i felt like myself out there,\" degrom said. once whitley left, the yankees' bullpen dellin betances, adam warren and david robertson combined for 10 strikeouts. betances was particularly dominant, striking out the side in the sixth and the seventh. mets hitters were helpless, shut out by the yankees for the second straight night, and degrom's debut, while impressive, had been wasted. \"i'm anxious to see him when he gets back out there,\" collins said. inside pitch the mets placed catcher travis d'arnaud on the seven-day concussion list thursday after he was hit in the head tuesday on an alfonso soriano backswing.",

        "title": "davis cup finalists love living in switzerland (and those are just the french players).",
        "abstract": "villeneuve d'ascq, france it is switzerland versus france in this weekend's davis cup final. it is also swiss resident versus swiss resident. all four french players jo-wilfried tsonga, gael monfils, richard gasquet and julien benneteau live on the swiss side of the border. so does the chief substitute gilles simon, just like many french stars of the past, including amelie mauresmo, guy forget, marion bartoli and cedric pioline. \"it's true, but we can't talk too much about that, especially with president hollande coming,\" pioline, a former united states open and wimbledon finalist, said with a chuckle. france's president, francois hollande, will watch two teams that represent different nations but reside in only one teams that know each other well and mixed easily at thursday's draw ceremony in the historic center of lille. \"there's a connection,\" said pioline, who is here for the final. \"the fact that the swiss players speak french also makes a difference. it's more of a final between cousins than brothers, but it's still a final, so i wouldn't expect any presents.\" the french tennis exodus to switzerland is largely due to the lighter fiscal load in switzerland. \"after my first year, i saw what i earned and then i saw what was left in my bank account, and then i moved,\" said simon, who said he relocated in 2006. asked how much he had saved by moving, simon answered in a recent interview, \"uh, a lot.\" he then started to walk away. \"that's enough,\" he said of the topic. \"it's not politics.\" even if simon would prefer to talk tennis, politicians have become involved. in 2012, yannick noah and forget were called in front of a french senate committee that was investigating the phenomenon of tax exiles. tsonga made a point last year of explaining that he did pay some taxes in france. \"people don't necessarily have all the elements to judge,\" tsonga said. \"on my last tax declaration in 2011, i paid about 230,000 euros for 47 days of presence in france.\" all earnings in french tournaments and the davis cup are directly taxable by french authorities, as are some sponsorship contracts. tsonga also pointed out that professional tennis players were independent contractors who typically had high earnings for a relatively short period and needed to maximize their savings to prepare for the time when their playing careers were over. to maintain his advantageous tax status in his swiss canton, tsonga is not permitted to work in switzerland. that is not difficult given how many months a year he spends on the road, but it is odd in that he is unable to play in pro tournaments in switzerland. french players also cite the quality of life on the swiss side of the border and, in some cases, the quality of education for their children as motivation. some also like that they can have a lower profile in french-speaking switzerland than in their own country. also, one former player pointed out, they get fewer dirty looks when they drive their fancy cars. but this does not mean they feel swiss, a point underscored when the french sports daily l'equipe gave a quiz this week to the french davis cup players. tsonga incorrectly answered that the capital of switzerland was zurich instead of bern, and none could name the swiss national anthem (\"le cantique suisse\"). all five players, simon included, answered correctly when it came to last season's swiss super league club soccer champion (f.c. basel). \"i just feel we are representing france no matter where we live,\" simon said. \"i mean, we are not the only country where the players are not living in their country.\" that is certainly true. there are top players who seek tranquillity and optimal training conditions far from home, like kei nishikori of japan, who is based in bradenton, fla. maria sharapova, who was born in russia and continues to represent russia, has spent most of her life in the united states (and trains in bradenton at img academy). european tennis players and other athletes have been seeking tax shelter and sunshine for decades in monaco, a tiny principality that offers no appreciable tax advantages to french citizens. among the monaco residents in this era are caroline wozniacki of denmark and novak djokovic, the no. 1 male player, of serbia. \"when we played against serbia in 2010, did you think that we are playing against serbia or monte carlo?\" simon asked. still, there has never been a davis cup final quite like one, with all of the men on both rosters living in the same country. \"of course we tease them,\" marc rosset, a former swiss player and davis cup captain, said in an interview with the french newspaper la depeche du midi. \"and i would not be at all surprised to see a banner relating to that in villeneuve d'ascq.\" tsonga told l'equipe in an interview: \"what i like here is that i don't have to talk about my life all the time; nobody comes to bother me. i have the impression i have a normal life. here people don't care what i do. they see me. they give me a wave. it's real life. when i first came here, it was a fiscal decision. but i could have lived in geneva. if i came here, it's not by chance. i am at the foot of the mountains. i can take bike rides. i can fish in the rivers and lakes. everything i like. when my career's over, it's not impossible that i'll stay.\" france does have bike rides, mountains, fish, rivers and lakes of its own, however. arnaud clement, the french davis cup captain, who only recently retired from the atp tour, is back in france after his swiss sojourn. other retirees have stayed put, including mauresmo, the former women's no. 1 who now coaches andy murray, and forget, the longtime french davis cup captain who won the competition as a player in 1991 and 1996. but in neither of those years did forget have to play against his almost-fellow swiss in the final.",

        "abstract": "it was easy to tell who the sports fans were in central park on tuesday afternoon. they were the ones doing double takes, pulling out their camera phones and snapping photographs of two top professional athletes who were nudging soccer balls around in the grass. steve nash, a two-time most valuable player in the n.b.a., and claudio reyna, once a mainstay on the united states national soccer team, were warming up for what was supposed to be a pickup soccer game in the sheep meadow between one of nash's recreational-league teams and several players for the red bulls, reyna's professional squad in major league soccer. nash spends most of the year running the point for the phoenix suns , but in the off-season, he can be found playing soccer in rec leagues in new york. \"it's better for me than just running lines,\" he said. \"i don't want to play a lot of basketball until september's over or i'll burn myself out. i just shoot, work out and play soccer.\" but not in the sheep meadow. the 15-acre patch of grass is for passive recreation only, park officials said as they shut down the game tuesday between nash's team and the red bulls players before it started. employees of the central park conservancy established that the group did not have a permit, then asked the soccer players to remove their cleats \"there is a reason the turf is in such nice shape,\" one of them said. that prompted vigorous but futile protests from nash's team, promotion factory, which is composed almost entirely of italian transplants. \"soccer is not loved,\" shouted one player from nash's team, winning a round of laughing cheers from his teammates. \"they are always trying to contain it,\" said another, insisting that the incident illustrated why soccer was not more popular in the united states. to appease the park officials, the match was moved to a nearby patch of dirt. but concern about the potential for injury on such the surface led a red bulls official to forbid the players from participating. reyna and his teammates stood by and watched as nash's team split into two groups and played on their own. standing on the sideline with his children, reyna, who was captain of the united states national team in last summer's world cup, said nash was an excellent soccer player. \"he's got the vision like on the court,\" reyna said. \"when you have vision in soccer, you can connect the pass. it's the same idea. you can see that from playing basketball, and also from growing up playing soccer, he understands the game.\" soccer was nash's first love he said his first word as an infant was goal. his father played professionally in south africa and england, his sister was the captain of her university team, and his younger brother, martin, has played on canada's national team. \"i think my dad, more than anything, gave me the passion,\" nash said later, in a telephone interview tuesday night. \"i remember sitting on the steps waiting for him to come home, and we'd be playing in the backyard before he even had his tie off.\" nash's other recreational team plays in an eight-a-side league at pier 40, in a league populated by college friends trying to stay in touch and desk-job dreamers trying to stay in shape. nash's team wears t-shirts adorned with the name phebe's, a bar and grill on the bowery where they sometimes adjourn for postgame camaraderie. \"at pier 40, it's better because everyone's there for our league,\" nash said. \"there's not a lot of people around. i can just be one of the guys.\" at a game there in june, the phebe's team beat a group of cornell graduates, 8-4. jeremy freyer, the opposing squad's goalkeeper in that match, said he initially was not aware that one of the n.b.a.'s biggest stars was in the game. \"i didn't even realize it was him until it was the second half and he scored a couple goals on me,\" freyer said. \"it made me feel a little better.\" nash travels to europe occasionally to attend soccer matches; he said he followed the english premier league the closest particularly his favorite team, tottenham hotspur. \"the atmosphere is electrifying,\" nash said of england's top league. \"the pace is great, with the fans singing along. they demand a passionate performance. the fans are right on top of the players. anyone who's ever had a chance to go to a premiership knows there's nothing like it.\" certainly not central park, where the only fans who watched nash's entire pickup game were his wife, alejandra, and his twin daughters. by the end, alejandra seemed excited to leave. as nash grinned and shook hands with his teammates, she said, \"the one time i come to one of these games, it's just three hours of eating dust.\"",

        "title": "texas and texas a&m will say farewell for now.",
        "abstract": "the fight songs are finally accurate. since the 1920s, we texas a&m fans have sung \"goodbye to texas university/so long to the orange and white\" and swayed from end zone to end zone as we \"sawed\" the horns off the university of texas . and since about the '30s, longhorns fans have countered with \"texas fight, texas fight/and it's goodbye to a&m.\" but most people barely noticed the aggies reference until this fall, until it was too late. on thursday, the aggies and the longhorns will say their goodbyes in the last scheduled game of the rivalry, which began in 1894 (and became a thanksgiving tradition in 1900). the end, after 117 games, is a consequence of conference realignments. a&m, which bolted the big 12 for the southeastern conference, says that it still wants to face the longhorns. texas, whose $300 million longhorn network almost imploded the big 12, says that its nonconference schedule is booked through 2018. besides, texas has the enduring red river rivalry against oklahoma, an early-season game often with poll implications. richard tapia, who was the longhorns' costumed mascot from 1999 to 2003, called the relationship between oklahoma and texas fans \"mean-spirited.\" he added with a laugh: \"i can't stand those o.u. fans hate 'em. i don't know them, have no use for them.\" a&m and texas, however, draw from the same well-populated counties and have what is considered a friendly sibling rivalry akin to \"the brady bunch.\" if the administrations' longstanding snit could be reduced to marcia (pretty yet snooty texas) versus jan (neglected yet overwrought a&m), the longhorns and the aggies fans are more like greg and peter, wrestling in the yard before the turkey is served. sorry, texas christian, baylor and texas tech you are the cindys and bobbys of this extended metaphor, and few aggies or longhorns want to play you on thanksgiving. \"your best friend from high school might have gone to texas a&m,\" natalie butler, the texas student body president, said. \"and we know that it's a very good school. it's more like in the family.\" texas has dominated the series, 75-37-5, with a&m having the excuse of being an all-male military institution until the mid-1960s. the corps of cadets and its marching band, even as they make up about 2,000 of the 40,000 undergraduates, remain a&m's most enduring image. when the longhorns hosted the game, as recently as last year, the corps paraded in downtown austin . \"you march over the bridge and straight up toward the capitol,\" said david benac, a member of the corps and the aggies' head yell leader. (aggies don't cheer, they yell.) \"you're playing the 'aggie war hymn' or 'noble men of kyle field,' songs that aggies have heard for years. and you have people just whistling, hooting and hollering and loving it. i've had numerous people come up to me and say, 'i'm not an aggie, but i wanted to show my kids this, show them what the corps is and it's such a great thing.' \" but things change. when i graduated from a&m in 1981, the lighting of the bonfire was the pregame highlight of the rivalry. but the current a&m freshmen were entering grade school when the bonfire collapsed in 1999, killing 12. \"bonfire was a relic from a different time,\" said w. k. stratton, the author of the 2002 book \"backyard brawl: inside the blood feud between texas and texas a&m.\" \"it survived till 1999, was canceled permanently in 2001, and that sort of portended the end of this rivalry as it once was.\" because the longhorns and the aggies are currently slightly above average, expect non-bowl championship series bowls in texas to try to artificially renew the rivalry by inviting them. in the meantime, jeff pickering, the texas a&m student body president, said he might try to pass legislation urging its continuation. \"we want to go the sec, but we also do not want to lose our rivalry with texas,\" pickering said. \"and the reason that we said that is because the rivalry doesn't belong to us. it's not ours to say yes or no to it's not the university of texas or the longhorns this game belongs to the state of texas.\" butler seemed less optimistic. \"i think that's a great rivalry for a lot of reasons that, for a lot of reasons, should be preserved,\" she said. \"but i think there are people way above my pay grade that made that decision, and i don't exactly know what all their rationale was.\" because it's complicated. or as simple as the two-page ad a&m bought in texas monthly, which recently profiled the messy breakup of the rivalry: \"the time is right for change.\" even for the \" aggie war hymn \"? although louisiana state and a&m played regularly my cousin hugh mcelroy, the aggies' first black starter, caught a last-minute 79-yard pass to upset the tigers in 1970 other sec fans might mock the aggies' preoccupation with texas. pickering said the remedy was to replace the oft-heard second verse with the first, which was actually written later and ignored by students. \"we saw varsity's horns off, and that will never change,\" pickering said. \"i think this would be a great thing during this time of stepping out on a national stage in the sec is to start singing the first verse,\" which \"mentions some of these terms that are so important to our culture here at a&m: the aggie spirit, yelling, talks about maroon and white, so it will help us with our branding.\" the 21st-century texas a&m is indeed a brand, even if tradition is part of the package. on thursday, watch the aggies trying to sway and snap photographs with their smartphones at the same time.",

        "title": "iran's next president faults ahmadinejad on economy.",
        "abstract": "tehran iran's president-elect, hassan rowhani, painted a bleak picture of the country's economy on monday, blaming the departing administration of president mahmoud ahmadinejad for high inflation and unemployment, and saying it \"has left much work to be done.\" mr. rowhani said mr. ahmadinejad's government had presented a far-too-optimistic picture of the economy, which even according to official statistics is stumbling. \"we asked current officials about the situation of the country,\" mr. rowhani said, \"but their reports and those of our teams were very far from each other.\" speaking in parliament, mr. rowhani said the inflation rate, officially listed as 32 percent, was 42 percent, the local news media reported. iran's economy actually contracted during the past two years, he said, for the first time since the iran-iraq war in the 1980s. he said he was especially concerned about unemployment among educated young people. \"according to our statistics,\" mr. rowhani said, \"we will have 4.5 million unemployed university graduates four years from now.\" but mr. ahmadinejad picked up some unexpected support from the supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, and other conservatives, who for months have criticized mr. ahmadinejad as incompetent and as someone who surrounded himself with corrupt elements. \"the respected president and his colleagues faced enormous tasks and operated rapidly in comparison with all the other governments,\" ayatollah khamenei said during a speech broadcast on iran's state radio. \"we must consider their huge workload, tireless efforts. this cabinet avoided comfort and grants, whereas most officials in the world and in the country benefit from them.\" mr. rowhani's close aide akbar torkan, who acts as a liaison with mr. ahmadinejad's government, told the local news media that the economic state of the country was \"much worse than expected.\" several lawmakers also criticized some last-minute decisions by the departing government. in one instance, mr. ahmadinejad transferred the largest plot of buildable land in the capital to the voice and vision organization, iran's state broadcaster. that decision was accompanied by a ceremony lauding the president organized by the state broadcaster. image the iranian president-elect, hassan rowhani, attended friday prayer last week at a university in the capital, tehran. credit atta kenare/agence france-presse getty images in another move, the central bank quietly cut the official value of the local currency, the rial, in half, so that a dollar now buys 24,500 rials, up from 12,260. while economists say the new figure still does not reflect the rial's true value, more than 30,000 to the dollar, it will help the government pay off outstanding debts to banks, but at the price of further stoking inflation and raising the prices of basic goods. \"they hypothetically made a huge amount of money,\" which they used reduce their debts with banks and other state organizations, ahmad tavakkoli, a lawmaker, told the semiofficial mehr news agency on monday. \"this is illegal and dangerous.\" mr. ahmadinejad, who was barred by the constitution from seeking a third four-year term, had seemingly fallen from grace in the months leading up to the june vote. he clashed with parliament, the judiciary and the hard-line clerics who accused him and his entourage of secretly plotting to oust them from power. the judiciary opened several corruption cases against mr. ahmadinejad's close associates, and the state newspaper, kayhan, accused him of mismanaging the economy and undermining ayatollah khamenei. on sunday, however, the newspaper's editor in chief, hossein shariatmadari, accused reformists and enemies of the state of hatching a \"big plot\" against the departing government. \"his government has been unprecedented,\" mr. shariatmadari wrote of mr. ahmadinejad. \"his services are everlasting.\" the change in attitude might signal a behind-the-scenes compromise, analysts say, or illustrate the tendency of iran's governing establishment of hard-line clerics and commanders to close ranks in the end. mr. rowhani has signaled his intention to pursue improved relations with the united states, though it remains unclear if he has the desire or the authority to soften iran's position over its disputed nuclear program, an underlying cause of the estrangement. iran insists that its program is peaceful, while the united states and other western nations suspect that iran is seeking the ability to build nuclear weapons. negotiations stalled before mr. rowhani's successful election campaign. on monday, a group of 29 former, prominent american government officials, diplomats, military officers and national security experts sent a letter to president obama, urging him to take advantage of mr. rowhani's signals. the letter called mr. rowhani's ascendance \"a major potential opportunity to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff over iran's nuclear program.\" the letter was submitted a day after prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel, who has said many times that he regards a nuclear-armed iran as an \"existential threat,\" sought to increase the pressure on the obama administration to take a tougher line with iran and its newly elected president on the nuclear issue. mr. netanyahu said that the united states should intensify its sanctions and that the iranians \"have to know you'll be prepared to take military action; that's the only thing that will get their attention.\"",

        "title": "outcome of eric garner case bares a staten island divide.",
        "abstract": "in the hours after a grand jury decided not to indict a white new york police officer whose chokehold helped cause the death of an unarmed black man on staten island, the city seemed to throb with a single cry of bafflement and fatigue. this time, a cellphone camera had captured the encounter. this time, the protesters had hoped, the video would act as a bulwark against the unpredictability of a grand jury. but the wave of disappointment that followed the jury verdict on wednesday barely touched the south shore of staten island. the borough where eric garner died is home to thousands of new york police officers, and in the neighborhoods where many of them live, the same video engendered a sense of deference to the officer involved, daniel pantaleo. far from evidence of brutality, the video was seen as a snapshot of the daily risks that police officers face, risks that are not helped by the broadsides of elected officials. at strip malls and restaurants a few miles from the spot where mr. garner died, many people interviewed were reluctant to draw any conclusions from the video. \"i feel there's two sides to every story,\" kathy gambardella, 53, said. reflecting on the experience of a close friend who is a police officer, she said, \"they don't want to pull out their gun, but no matter what their training says, at some point they have to defend themselves.\" some people recalled nights spent waiting for sons or brothers who are police officers to return from patrol. they said they felt the same sense of unease bubble up as they watched the video, in which mr. garner, weighing over 300 pounds, became agitated as officer pantaleo tried to restrain him. image of the grand jury's decision, emmanuel rogers said, \"blacks are not treated fairly on staten island.\" credit kirsten luce for the new york times \"when you're an officer, your own life is in danger,\" said angela, 60, whose brother is a police officer and who, like several of those interviewed, declined to provide her surname. officer pantaleo, she said, was in danger that day. \"he could've died himself.\" in testimony to the grand jury, officer pantaleo described the fear he felt during the encounter with mr. garner. he said he had worried about crashing through a glass window, or being thrown off balance by the larger man, his lawyer said after the announcement that the grand jury had found no basis to charge officer pantaleo. staten island has about 470,000 residents, and some of its neighborhoods have historically been home to many civil servants, particularly firefighters and police officers. about 3,000 of the 17,000 uniformed police officers who live in new york city make their home in the borough. the borough's population is more than 60 percent white, while blacks account for less than 10 percent, with most of them living along the borough's north shore. protests against the police have unfolded there, including in the tompkinsville neighborhood where mr. garner died and elsewhere. even on the south shore, support for officer pantaleo was not universal. some people bristled at the steadfast backing he has received locally, saying that it was racially motivated. they argued that only on staten island, where support for police officers is virtually a prerequisite for elected office, would officer pantaleo not have been indicted. \"we want his badge, and we want his pension,\" peggy blair, 81, said. \"what you have on this island is a lot of white republicans, and they're racist bigots.\" for others, their own experience in law enforcement left no tolerance for what they said was disrespect for the work police officers do. \"a majority of people don't understand what officers face on a daily basis,\" said william, 57, a retired new york detective who also declined to give his surname. \"did he violate department guidelines? yeah, but he didn't have any intent to cause the guy's death.\" image paul anthony morris jr. described the protests on wednesday as \"a total overreaction.\" credit kirsten luce for the new york times as he left a home supplies store, william added that the focus on low-level offenses and a surge of public hostility toward police officers had made the job more dangerous. \"there were a lot of situations where i almost got killed,\" he said. one man who described himself as an aspiring police officer, paul anthony morris jr., 28, mimed the chokehold used by officer pantaleo as he scanned images of protesters on the front page of a newspaper. \"it's a total overreaction,\" he said. \"it was a headlock just to get him on the floor.\" for some residents, the verdict highlighted the racial divisions that continue to cleave the borough, and that, they said, leave black residents feeling harassed by police officers. emmanuel rogers, 45, a security guard who lives in the port richmond neighborhood but works in the largely white area of oakwood, said officers had stopped his car on the suspicion that he had stolen it, and even stopped him while he was working to ask what he was doing in a shopping mall frequented by many white residents. \"blacks are not treated fairly on staten island,\" mr. rogers said. he added that the decision by the district attorney, daniel m. donovan jr., to convene a grand jury, rather than to bring the charges himself, was a reminder of the cozy relationship between prosecutors and police officers. one table away in the coffee shop where he was sitting, brian bellamy, a former inspector with the united states postal service, said it was uncooperative residents, not police officers, who were responsible for deteriorating police-community relations. when mr. rogers turned his chair to complain to mr. bellamy about the \"conflict of interest\" that had allowed officer pantaleo to avoid charges, mr. bellamy spoke over him, protesting that police officers would quit their jobs if they did not receive more public support. \"the scariest job in the world is being a police officer,\" mr. bellamy said, as mr. rogers rubbed his brow in frustration.",

        "abstract": "copenhagen a much-anticipated global meeting of nearly 200 nations all seeking what has so far been elusive common ground on the issue of climate change began here on monday with an impassioned airing of what leaders here called the political and moral imperatives at hand. \"the clock has ticked down to zero,\" said the united nations' climate chief, yvo de boer. \"after two years of negotiation, the time has come to deliver.\" from now until dec. 18, delegates will try to hammer out some of the most vexing details involved in the pursuit of a global climate accord. while the critical action will unfold much later in the process, when higher-level ministers and, ultimately, heads of state arrive, the opening day of the conference was an opportunity for the united nations to nurture a sense of mission and for delegates to begin staking out their positions. among the most difficult hurdles, many participants acknowledged throughout the day, are achieving adequate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions particularly from big polluters like the united states and china. so, too, are securing commitments from wealthy nations to deliver what could ultimately be hundreds of billions of dollars in financing to poor countries, which argue that they are ill equipped to deal with a problem they did little to create. several countries announced new emissions goals in the days leading up to the meeting, including china, brazil, the united states, india and south africa although many participants have noted that the targets are far too low to keep rising temperatures in check in coming decades. the pledges so far are \"not going to get us as far we need to go, to really stay within the two-degree limit,\" said koko warner, an observer with the united nations university in bonn, germany. he was referring to scientists' recommendations that temperature increases be capped at two degrees celsius (3.6 degrees fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. \"we don't want to admit it, because the consequences are so bad,\" she said. still, speakers at the conference's opening plenary session which began with a video appeal from children across the world to save them from what looked like an apocalyptic future of deserts and rising seas were clearly aiming to spur negotiators forward. after several hundred delegates and observers settled inside the main conference hall of the bella center to music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the danish girls choir, connie hedegaard, the danish minister presiding over the conference, noted the recent string of emissions commitments by various countries. \"every positive announcement will improve our chances of staying below the two degrees celsius target,\" she said. \"but as we all know only too well, we are not there yet.\" \"this goes for financing as well,\" ms. hedegaard said, noting that arriving at a consensus on that issue \"may be an even bigger challenge\" than emissions cuts. rajendra k. pachauri, the chairman of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, spoke before delegates of the urgent need for action. and, alluding to a recent controversy over e-mail messages between scientists hacked from a university computer server, he had pointed remarks for those who \"find it difficult to accept\" climate change science. climate change skeptics have argued that the e-mail shows that the evidence for global warming is less unequivocal than scientists assert. but dr. pachauri ticked off a list of trends that robustly reflect the warming of the global climate. \"internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including the individuals singled out in these e-mail messages,\" he said. both inside and outside the plenary session, the mood among negotiators and other participants was one of cautious optimism. alden meyer, who directs climate policy for the union of concerned scientists, said he was encouraged that the meeting appeared to have nudged previously reluctant nations to begin offering up emissions cuts. \"it has focused attention and gotten all the major players to put their initial offers on the table,\" mr. meyer said. \"i think that's good news.\" still, negotiators who have spent the last year working out the technical details of a potential treaty are now coming up hard against political pressures at much higher levels that will ultimately shape any agreement. the challenge, mr. meyer said, will be getting parties to \"rise above the politics as usual\" that threatens to bog down the process. jonathan pershing, the state department's special climate envoy, who represented the united states at the opening plenary, said he saw strong signs that the conference would prove critical in getting traction on curbing emissions and helping poor countries that are urgently threatened by climate change particularly given the decision by more than 100 leaders, including president obama, to attend. he said he saw no indication that efforts could be blunted by saudi arabia and other countries that have cited the e-mail flap in challenging climate findings. at a subsequent news conference, however, mr. pershing faced questions from european reporters about the adequacy of mr. obama's plan for emissions cuts, which is roughly parallel to what is laid out in legislation in the house and senate. mr. pershing said the american proposal which calls for a reduction in emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, 42 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 was in keeping with cuts that scientists say would avert the worst dangers, but only if all countries, including emerging economies, did their part. \"it's a vision that moves the united states down the curve of greenhouse gas emissions at a level that no other country has even begun to seriously contemplate,\" mr. pershing said. while the united states produces one-fifth of worldwide greenhouse emissions, he noted, four-fifths are coming from elsewhere. \"unless the world can combine its efforts, we won't solve the problem,\" he said. outside the bella center, calls were growing for conference participants to overcome their differences and deliver results in coming days. an open letter from a coalition of groups, including friends of the earth, the third world network and others, accused danish leaders of \"undemocratic practices\" and of \"convening small and exclusive groups of countries before the copenhagen meeting.\" the assertion is a reference to rumors that \"alternate\" treaties are being readied by some big players, including conference organizers, should efforts to resolve differences on the current text prove fruitless. meanwhile, 56 newspapers around the world published the same editorial calling for \"decisive action\" in copenhagen. \"in scientific journals the question is no longer whether humans are to blame, but how little time we have got left to limit the damage,\" read the editorial, which was widely distributed in a campaign led by britain's guardian newspaper. \"yet so far the world's response has been feeble and half-hearted.\" continued inaction will ravage the planet and wreak havoc on economies and livelihoods, the editorial's authors warned. \"the politicians in copenhagen have the power to shape history's judgment on this generation: one that saw a challenge and rose to it, or one so stupid that we saw calamity coming but did nothing to avert it,\" the editorial said. \"we implore them to make the right choice.\"",

        "abstract": "this interview with david rosenblatt, chief executive of 1stdibs, an online marketplace for high-end goods including art, antiques, jewelry and furniture, was conducted and condensed by adam bryant. q. were you in leadership roles early on? a. i was president of my class and co-president of my debating society in high school. but leadership was never my goal. i studied liberal arts, and majored in east asian studies in college. my father was in foreign service roles, and i always assumed i would end up in the foreign service. after i graduated, i lived in asia for a few years. my first real work experience after school was in investment banking. i learned pretty quickly that that wasn't a world i wanted to be a part of. what i love about the internet is the ability to create or change an industry as opposed to simply participate in one that already exists. tell me more about your parents. my father had a lot of work in the pacific. i traveled quite a bit with him, which kind of stoked my interest in asia in particular. he's a lawyer by training and he's very much a linear thinker. my mother's a psychotherapist, author and teacher, and she's much more of an intuitive and empathetic thinker. i probably skew more to her side than i do my father's. leadership is about people, so having that sensitivity is important. there's a story about my mother that had a big impact on me. when i was a kid growing up in washington, i used to take the same bus home every day. one day, my mother happened to take the bus with me, and the place we were going to was between two stops. she's israeli, so she has the same healthy disregard for rules that many israelis have. she walked up to the bus driver and said, \"excuse me, but would it be possible to stop the bus in between these two stops so we can get out?\" the bus driver agreed to do it, and probably two-thirds of the other people on the bus got out. i just remember thinking that all these people are taking the bus every single day of their lives, and two-thirds of them really wanted to get off at a spot other than the bus stops. yet it took someone to ask the bus driver a question to do something different, and many people benefited from it. that story has always stuck in my mind as an example of the importance of not taking things as a given. that's sort of the philosophy of the internet as a whole. image \"companies are like families, in the sense that if the parents get along, then it's likely that the rest of the family will be relatively harmonious.\" credit earl wilson/the new york times other important lessons you've learned over your career? when i was first promoted to c.e.o., the hardest thing to figure out was, how do i spend my time? on any given day, a c.e.o. could do almost anything or nothing, and it would likely have little or no impact on the company, at least in the short term. so i had to develop a set of rules to figure out how to manage my time. i learned rule no. 1 from irv grousbeck, who teaches an entrepreneurship class at stanford business school. and that is, very simply, \"you can hire people to do everything but hire people.\" rule no. 2 that i think about every day is, \"only do the things that only i can do.\" so if it's someone else's job to do it, i try not to do it. if i find myself doing too many of those things that are actually someone else's job, then it relates back to rule no. 1 i probably don't have the right person in that role. but just like anyone in any role, it's important to understand, where is my comparative advantage? what am i better at than almost anyone else? to the extent that there is something you're better at than most other people, you should do it, and then you should just make sure that your team complements you. the hard thing for many c.e.o.'s, because this job requires a certain level of confidence, is to figure out what you're not good at and acknowledge that, and then hire to offset your own limitations. what else about your leadership approach? i try to invest quite a bit of time in developing chemistry and sense of team among my direct reports. generally my feeling is that companies are like families, in the sense that if the parents get along, then it's likely that the rest of the family will be relatively harmonious. but if the parents don't get along, it's highly likely that there's going to be conflict in the rest of the family that, to some degree, mirrors the conflict between the parents. and if the executive team is talented and unified in their approach, treats each other with respect and communicates openly, their behavior will be mirrored by everybody in the company. how do you hire? what questions do you ask? my approach is pretty straightforward. i like to ask people to walk me through their lives from the time they were young through the present. i pay particular attention to transitions, because i think that says a lot about people's values and judgment, and the basis on which they make decisions. why did you pick this school instead of that school? why was this the right first job? why did you take two years off? when you left that company, what choices did you have, and why did you pick door no. 1 instead of door no. 4? i find that if you listen to the narrative of people's lives, you get a better sense of them as people and as professionals than any other approach i've taken. it can also uncover whether there might be problems. people are creatures of habit, and they tend to repeat patterns, even in different contexts. do they have a pattern of job-hopping? that is a particularly deadly characteristic, in my point of view. it's o.k. in fact, it's a positive to make mistakes in judgment at some point in your life. but did the person understand it? did they take the time to figure it out? did they then repeat it? it's not really what they did that is important to me. it's how they reached those decisions.",

        "title": "romania parliament votes to impeach traian basescu.",
        "abstract": "berlin the political crisis in romania deepened friday after the parliament in bucharest voted to impeach president traian basescu amid rising international criticism of the government's apparent attempts to usurp power and subvert the country's young democracy. the impeachment was one step among many that critics say prime minister victor ponta has taken in recent months to consolidate his rule. the governing coalition has already fired the speakers of both chambers of parliament an action the opposition called unconstitutional and replaced the country's ombudsman, who has the power to challenge emergency legislation before the constitutional court. the court's justices have been threatened with removal before their terms were up, although that idea was scrapped after an international outcry. but mr. ponta reduced the court's power and is moving ahead with the impeachment. mr. ponta and his left-leaning social liberal union contend that mr. basescu has violated the constitution and accuse him of acting as a dictator, although the powers of the romanian president are limited compared with the prime minister's. the constitutional court ruled friday that mr. basescu had not violated the constitution, although the decision was nonbinding. \"what dictator lets the opposition have the post of prime minister?\" mr. basescu asked in the debate leading up to the vote, which he lost decisively, with 256 members of parliament voting to remove him and 114 voting against. in the next step, romanian voters will decide in a nationwide referendum, planned for july 29, whether mr. basescu can remain in office. in a statement on friday, the european commission said it was \"concerned about current developments in romania,\" in particular the moves to reduce the power of independent institutions like the constitutional court. \"the rule of law, the democratic checks and balances and the independence of the judiciary are cornerstones of the european democracy and indispensable for mutual trust within the european union,\" it said. a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel of germany said friday that she was watching the situation \"with deep concern.\" it is the second time that mr. basescu a former sea captain, anticorruption crusader and polarizing political figure has faced a referendum to remove him from office. a similar effort in 2007 failed when 74 percent of the voters opposed the move. but mr. basescu's association with detested austerity programs has taken a toll on his popularity, and opinion surveys show he could lose this time. romania's political class is divided by bitter personal rivalries and a public that has taken to the streets in sometimes destructive protests against the austerity programs, as well as the stagnant growth. parliament already passed a law that would ease the removal of the president through a referendum, requiring a majority of those voting. previously, a majority of all eligible voters was needed. after a recession in 2009, romania was forced to turn to the international monetary fund for emergency loans, which required the government to take drastic measures to curtail deficits, including cutting government salaries and raising the sales tax. the recent political turmoil, and the stern warnings from foreign leaders, have helped to drive the country's currency, the leu, to a record low against the euro. the situation in romania was the latest example of instability and weakening democratic institutions in the former communist bloc. civil society groups have criticized hungary's prime minister, viktor orban, for undermining democracy there. but the attention of european leaders appears to be so absorbed by the euro crisis that problems elsewhere seem to attract attention only when they reach a critical point. \"there's a greater and greater political trend toward an emphasis only on the euro zone,\" said hugo brady, a senior research fellow at the center for european reform, referring to the 17 countries that use the currency. \"it's almost as if it is now a 17-member european union and other countries just by-the-by in terms of their problems.\" romania has exhibited growing signs of political instability. the previous government fell at the end of april, two months after taking office, and mr. ponta became the country's third prime minister to hold the office this year.",

        "title": "italian business faces lose-lose situation in libya.",
        "abstract": "milan one hundred years have passed since italy invaded the provinces of libya to liberate them from the ottomans and install colonial rule in italian north africa. now, with nato aircraft flying daily from italian bases to pound targets controlled by the regime of col. muammar el-qaddafi, italy's longstanding post-colonial business ties risk taking a hit, too. italian companies are at risk of collateral damage whether colonel qaddafi hangs on to power, the rebels take over, or the country splits into a rebel-governed east and a qaddafi-ruled west. \"this is the worst scenario,\" said arturo varvelli, research fellow at the institute of international political studies in milan, arguing that italy and its business interests would be left in a lose-lose situation: colonel qaddafi, still in power in the tripolitania region, would be little inclined to do big business with italian companies as in the past, while in the east, the rebels of the cyrenaica region would instead turn toward other european business partners \"less compromised\" by ties with the regime in tripoli. \"italy's position on the libyan crisis has been shifting progressively as the situation on the ground has evolved,\" mr. varvelli said, \"and now it's the first enemy of the libyan regime.\" that assessment has a lot of historical significance. italy's long colonial rule of libya morphed into a love-hate relationship that crystallized in 2008, when prime minister silvio berlusconi apologized to colonel qaddafi for colonial-era transgressions and agreed to invest $5 billion in libyan infrastructure over 20 years. the two signed an italy-libya friendship treaty in the city of benghazi, now capital of the rebel movement sweeping libya, and deepened economic cooperation on oil , banking, construction and even in the realm of top-rank soccer. not everyone in libya fully embraced the relationship, and it was up to italy to pave the way, which it did by deepening its business ties with colonel qaddafi to the benefit of both countries. \"for a long time, italian citizens and politicians were not very appreciated in libya,\" said sebastiano sali, an academic in the department of war studies at king's college in london. \"to settle this bitterness\" left over from the colonial era, \"especially on the african side of the mediterranean,\" he said, \"most of the previous italian governments have increased bilateral relations with tripoli, and also openly supported colonel qaddafi as a 'not as bad as the other' african dictators to let him gain some legitimacy on the international stage.\" dozens of italian companies got in line for the lucrative contracts, while eni, the oil conglomerate, and impregilo, the construction company, quickly strengthened their longstanding positions in the north african country. eni, in which the qaddafi regime holds a 2 percent stake, is the biggest foreign company operating in libya. but with conflict raging across the country, the energy giant recently expressed doubts that it would reach its 2011 targets. other italian companies were just finding their footing in libya when the conflict broke out this spring, as tripoli sought to diversify its economy away from oil and increase its property and tourism sectors. ansaldo, a construction company, won contracts worth over $1 billion for work on a coastal railroad between surt and benghazi. on all these kinds of projects, italian companies were favored over other european firms, as the special relationship between rome and tripoli deepened. now, italian companies could end up being the biggest losers if the qaddafi government falls. \"for some small and medium-sized companies, orders from libya were the only ones they had,\" said mr. varvelli. \"i imagine, however, that eni will be the most worried. the libyan market was fundamental to the group's strategy. libyan oil was of good quality and was close by, so transport and refinement costs were low.\" the extent of libyan investment in italy's fragile economy is another red flag for rome's policy makers. holdings by the libyan investment authority in many of italy's most prized assets climbed steadily over the past years and underpinned many of these companies when the financial crisis struck in 2008. the libyan investment authority has a 7.5 percent stake in unicredit, to make it the second-largest shareholder in italy's largest bank; it also has shares in the mediobanca group. likewise, the authority is very active in italy's industrial sector, with a 2 percent stake in fiat; and it owns 7.5 percent of juventus, the soccer club. while it is not clear what the outcome of the civil war in libya will be, the chamber of commerce for italy-africa said that italian companies could lose as much as $140 billion in disrupted trade as the war in libya drags on. an illustration of the vulnerability of major italian companies to the events in libya came on feb. 21, when colonel qaddafi's stated determination to stay in power wiped out up to 6 percent of the share prices of eni, impregilo, ansaldo, sapiem, finmeccanica and unicredit on the italian stock exchange. since that day, analysts have remained highly cautious about the stocks of italian companies with heavy exposure to libya. should a new government take power in tripoli, italy will face tough decisions as regards libyan assets it was required to freeze under europe-wide sanctions imposed on the regime in february. in an interview with the italian television network rai in march, finance minister giulio tremonti raised the possibility of revolutionary forces in libya saying, \"these funds are ours and we want them back.\" luca fiorita, a senior professor of economics at the university of palermo in sicily, said that if libya repatriated all the money it has invested in the italian economy, the result would be disastrous not only for the italy but for the war-torn libyan economy as well. he added that the italian finance minister had \"participated in several discussions at the e.u. level to avoid damages to the interests of all nations.\" whatever the outcome of the conflict, the ensuing instability in libya will have long-term ramifications for the italian economy and its special relationship with its mediterranean neighbor. mr. varvelli said there was a \"real risk\" that a \"'new libya' might not be predisposed toward italy, the old friend of qaddafi,\" adding that even so, \"libya will always need certain technologies and know-how for its oil industry.\" the same largely applies even under a scenario in which colonel qaddafi somehow remains in power. giuseppe sacco, editor in chief of the european journal of international affairs in rome, said: \"he will have to re-establish relations with a number of countries, starting with potential buyers of libya's oil and gas.\" mr. sacco believes that italy, for a host of historical reasons, will be best positioned to get back down to business in libya, noting, for instance, that italy is linked to the country by an undersea pipeline and that \"it will be in libya's, as well as italy's, interest to keep it working.\" no matter who ends up ruling libya, mr. sacco said, \"libya has preferred to deal with italy among all possible european partners.\"",

        "abstract": "north charleston, s.c. the video of a north charleston police officer shooting an unarmed man in the back will now cost news outlets that want to run it $10,000, according to a publicist representing the man who shot it. cease-and-desist letters went out this week to news outlets around the world from markson sparks, a publicity and celebrity management company based in sydney, australia. the video, taken april 4, showed a north charleston police officer, michael t. slager, shooting a man who ran from him after a traffic stop. a bystander, feidin santana , took the video and then turned it over to the family of the man who was killed, walter l. scott. the officer was charged with murder and remains jailed. the video, viewed more than one million times on youtube alone, quickly came to represent the excessive use of force by the police. the announcement about the fee seemed to come as a surprise to mr. santana. he later recalled that his lawyer mentioned something about charging for it, but said he did not understand. the lawyer, todd rutherford, said it was only fair for mr. santana to start getting paid for something that news outlets benefited from. \"the search for justice is served by turning the video over to law enforcement,\" mr. rutherford said. the news media, he said, appeared to be in the \"search for revenue.\" copyright experts agreed that although news agencies are allowed to use even copyrighted material under what is called \"fair use\" clauses in the law that time period has passed. \"at some point it's not newsworthy anymore and you are using it for commercial benefit,\" said frederic haber, a vice president and general counsel of the copyright clearance center , a collective licensing organization that works on behalf of copyright holders such as the new york times. the issue could change once the video is played in court during a trial, he said. the times has used the video with the family's permission and not received a cease and desist letter. max markson, chief executive of markson sparks, said by phone from australia: \"i think that the people who might be put off by this are the media outlets that had it for free. now they will have to pay.\" he said the fee amount would be negotiable, although another person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to speak publicly said news media outlets were being charged a one-time fee of $10,000. a lawyer for mr. scott's family said the relatives remain grateful to mr. santana and have no problem with him receiving a financial benefit. \"without the video, we would not be where we are right now,\" said justin bamberg, one of the family's lawyers.",

        "title": "relaxing privacy vow, whatsapp will share some data with facebook.",
        "abstract": "san francisco when facebook bought the start-up whatsapp in 2014, jan koum, one of whatsapp's founders, declared that the deal would not affect the digital privacy of his mobile messaging service's millions of users. \"we don't know your birthday. we don't know your home address,\" mr. koum wrote in a blog post at the time. \"none of that data has ever been collected and stored by whatsapp, and we really have no plans to change that.\" two years later, in a move that is rankling some of the company's more than one billion users, whatsapp will soon begin to share some member information with facebook. whatsapp said on thursday that it would start disclosing the phone numbers and analytics data of its users to facebook. it will be the first time the messaging service has connected users' accounts to the social network to share data, as facebook tries to coordinate information across its collection of businesses. whatsapp is changing its policy as it begins building a moneymaking business after long placing little emphasis on revenue. the company plans to allow businesses to contact customers directly through its platform. a similar strategy is already being tested on facebook messenger, a separate messaging service facebook owns. \"we want to explore ways for you to communicate with businesses that matter to you, too, while still giving you an experience without third-party banner ads and spam,\" whatsapp said in a blog post announcing the changes to its privacy policy. among the changes, facebook will be able to use a person's phone number to improve other facebook-operated services, such as making new facebook friend suggestions, or better-tailored advertising, whatsapp added. it said the data-sharing would also be used to fight spam text messages across its service. whatsapp emphasized that neither it nor facebook would be able to read users' encrypted messages and that individual phone numbers would not be given to advertisers. whatsapp users are still required to provide a phone number only to sign up for the service, and can opt out of giving it to facebook. while whatsapp operates autonomously from facebook, mr. koum sits on facebook's board. the changes were immediately viewed with a critical eye by some who were concerned when facebook bought whatsapp that their data could one day be misused. whatsapp made early inroads with people worldwide partly for its hard-line stance on privacy and individual liberties, which was rooted in mr. koum's youth in the 1980s in the soviet union, where, he has said, he lived in fear of his communications being monitored. mr. koum has also been outspoken against advertising in the app in general. many whatsapp users have appreciated just how different the service is from facebook. in some countries, like brazil, whatsapp's focus on privacy has led to criticism from law enforcement agencies that they cannot gain access to users' encrypted messages. \"our values and our respect for your privacy continue to guide the decisions we make at whatsapp,\" mr. koum said in a post on thursday. \"it's why we've rolled out end-to-end encryption, which means no one can read your messages other than the people you talk to. not us, not facebook, nor anyone else.\" he added, \"our focus is the same as it's always been giving you a fast, simple and reliable way to stay in touch with friends and loved ones around the world.\" whatsapp's privacy policy overhaul raises concerns about potential legal challenges. marc rotenberg, president of the electronic privacy information center, a privacy advocacy group in washington, said it would file a complaint on monday with the federal trade commission to stop whatsapp from sharing users' data with facebook. the group filed a similar case in 2014, citing promises that whatsapp had made to protect individuals' privacy. \"many users signed up for whatsapp and not facebook, precisely because whatsapp offered, at the time, better privacy practices,\" mr. rotenberg said by email. \"if the f.t.c. does not bring an enforcement action, it means that even when users choose better privacy services, there is no guarantee their data will be protected.\" similar legal steps could be taken abroad, where data protection rules are tougher. in europe, for instance, several national regulators have already taken legal action against facebook, claiming that it illegally collected information online about people who were not signed up on the social network. facebook has denied the accusations. facebook has also been at the heart of a debate over how people's information held in europe the company's users outside the united states are regulated from dublin should be transferred to the united states. in a legal case involving facebook last year, europe's top court ruled that american privacy standards did not offer sufficient protections to the region's citizens. the court, the european court of justice, also invalidated the so-called safe harbor agreement that permitted technology giants and 4,000 other companies to routinely move data across the atlantic. a new data-transfer pact, known as the e.u.-u.s. privacy shield, recently came into force , but it is facing legal challenges as privacy campaigners remain concerned that data held in europe could be improperly read by government agencies when moved to the united states. whatsapp's new privacy policy may put it in the middle of this tussle, pushing the company to reassure concerned users about how facebook may use their data.",

        "title": "in fifa politics, blatter is the consummate player.",
        "abstract": "sepp blatter is not a king. he is not a chancellor or a viceroy and he is, most assuredly, not a congressman or people's representative. technically, blatter is a president, the president of fifa, soccer's global governing body. to use that label alone, though, is to sell short the dominating (if not domineering) stature with which blatter rules. think of it this way: how many people can arrive in virtually any country with a minimum of pomp or protocol and then request an audience with the head of state, and receive one? blatter can. (and he has. in the past few months he has met with the president of cuba, the prime minister of guinea and the president of south africa.) such is the influence of soccer around the globe. in more private moments, blatter has likened fifa to a sovereign nation. he may not be so far off: after all, fifa has its own flag and anthem. and it has, in blatter, an outspoken and commanding figurehead who has led it through periods of prosperity, and a fair bit of shame and scandal, too. in nearly four decades with fifa, however, blatter has never overseen an issue as hotly debated as the one in front of him now. beginning thursday in zurich, blatter will preside over a meeting of fifa's executive committee, which consists of 25 voting members who essentially make soccer's most important decisions. if blatter has his way, one of the issues called for a vote will be whether to shift the 2022 world cup in qatar from its traditional summer schedule to the relative cool of late fall and winter in the middle east. on the surface, the change of just a few months for a tournament that takes place nine years from now should not amount to a crisis. but the ramifications of such a switch would be multiple and momentous. despite the large (and loud) group of soccer officials preaching pragmatism and patience before a potential move, blatter, who declined to comment for this article, has made it clear that he believes a change in dates is necessary. doing so will disrupt schedules around the world, but when blatter states a preference, that has historically meant only one outcome is possible. \"put it this way,\" said alan i. rothenberg, the former president of the united states soccer federation, who has known blatter for more than 30 years. \"in the mid-2000s, after the success of the '94 world cup, i was asked by morocco to help them win the bid for the 2010 world cup.\" even though blatter was publicly neutral, rothenberg said, it was clear he was intrigued by south africa as a potential host. \"so i went to him beforehand and asked if it would bother him for me to do this, to work with morocco,\" rothenberg said. \"he said: 'no, no, of course. go ahead and do it.' \" the night before the vote, after morocco had made its final presentation, a confident rothenberg said he thought, \"we've got this locked up.\" then he hesitated. \"to this day i'm not sure what happened, but i suspect that sepp was doing some things to make sure that people voted the way he wanted,\" rothenberg said. he sighed. \"i don't have to tell you what happened.\" south africa won the vote, 14-10. the politician there are 209 members of fifa, and blatter has worked for the organization in several positions for decades. not surprisingly, opinions of him run the gamut from savior to scoundrel. some consider him a visionary for what he has done to expand the reach of the game to less developed countries and regions shredded by strife. others describe him as an entrenched overlord who revels in fifa's lack of transparency. more casual observers might find him entertaining, a man who appears to have no internal filter. in recent years, he has noted that a female member of the executive committee is both \"good and good-looking\"; advised fans in england to pray to god if they ever hope to host the world cup again; and suggested, apparently jokingly, that gay fans who attend the world cup in qatar \"should refrain from any sexual activities\" because homosexuality is illegal there. image blatter, right, was welcomed by mohammed bin hammam, the former president of the asian football confederation, upon his arrival in doha, qatar, in 2010. credit osama faisal/associated press whatever one's opinion of him, a trait mentioned by almost all who know blatter is his political savvy. his strategy is not subtle. while fifa's financial power base might be in europe, which is home to soccer's richest players, clubs and leagues, blatter, a swiss, is far from beloved there. rather, he is known for currying favor, and votes, in africa and asia, seeing the future of the game in its two most populous confederations. optimists point out that those countries have greater needs than the european powers, and so the attention is merited. cynics note that fifa rules play into the hands of a smart politician: the 25-member executive committee consists largely of representatives of fifa's six confederations, but africa (four) and asia (four) have more votes than europe (seven). that gives botswana, iran and thailand as much voice as, say, germany, england and france. \"this is what he does just look at what he's been saying on qatar,\" said damian collins, a british parliamentarian and a longtime advocate for fifa reform. collins was referring to blatter's recent comments, made in an interview with the web site inside world football, in which he said that those who did not support shifting the dates of qatar's world cup to cooler months were essentially saying that a world cup could never be held in the southern hemisphere. \"it's completely crazy the world cup has already been played in the southern hemisphere and will be played in the southern hemisphere next year,\" collins said. \"but this is blatter; it's very calculated. you can see who his audience is for that: all of the small countries who will never have a world cup but want to dream they will and want to feel important. \"he's basically pushing this notion of imperialism in europe and how he is fighting with them against it. it doesn't matter that his larger point makes no sense.\" shaping a message has been a perpetual part of blatter's background even if his professional career has been eclectic. though his playing career was limited to switzerland's amateur leagues, his primary fame has come from his work in soccer. since 1975, he has risen from technical director for fifa to general secretary to president in 1998. a polyglot who speaks german, french, english, spanish and italian, blatter conscientiously built a deep network of influence as he advanced. rothenberg worked with blatter while leading the 1994 united states world cup host committee, and he recalled that even then, while still an underling to the former fifa president joao havelange, blatter \"combined the talent of being the executive and operational head with also being a political mastermind.\" defenders of blatter are quick to note his achievements. he has taken the game's biggest prize to virgin territory, overseeing the first world cups in asia and africa, and the awarding of the first to post-communist eastern europe, in russia in 2018. one of his first acts as president was to push through the recognition of palestine as its own soccer-playing nation, when fifa became one of the only major international organizations to recognize the palestinians in this way. blatter also has been at the forefront of getting israeli and palestinian representatives to discuss easing the tight restrictions on athletes in that region, and he has twice committed money to having a stadium in gaza rebuilt after conflicts with israel. \"blatter always gave the green light to things that were good for the palestinians and israelis,\" said jerome champagne, who worked as blatter's personal adviser and ran his successful re-election campaign in 2002. \"when we started collecting money for the new stadium to be built in the west bank in 2006, the first-ever palestinian stadium meeting fifa's international requirements, he said, 'do it.' blatter was fantastic in the way he supported that fully.\" champagne, who was later forced out at fifa, believes this will be a part of blatter's wider legacy. \"his legacy will be the universality of the game being taken to new territories and becoming the world's no. 1 sport, unquestionably,\" champagne said. \"his difficulty will be the 'but' which will come after that. people will say: 'blatter's done a tremendous job of promoting the universality of the game, but. ...' and that 'but' is the controversy and allegations.\" surrounded by scandal in addition to his more innocent verbal missteps, there are numerous examples of blatter's tendency toward tone-deafness. at last summer's confederations cup in brazil, he responded to violent protests throughout the country by suggesting that demonstrators should not use soccer to further their causes just as fifa announced its official champagne provider for the world cup. less benign are the allegations of corruption that have lingered over fifa for years. havelange resigned from fifa after the organization's ethics committee detailed his involvement in bribery schemes , and a significant number of former executive committee members, many of whom worked closely with blatter, have also stepped down. some cited ill health rather than looming investigations, and several continue to deny wrongdoing . image the palestinian president mahmoud abbas, right, greeted blatter during a meeting in 2011. credit thaer ganaim/palestinian press office, via getty images andrew jennings, a british journalist, has been pursuing blatter and fifa over allegations of corruption for more than a decade. much of his work has covered isl, a now-defunct company that held the rights to fifa's enormous international marketing contract. the company collapsed in 2001, mired in debt. in the fallout it was reported by jennings and others, and confirmed in a fifa ethics report released in april, that bribes had been paid to members of fifa's executive committee. the report cleared blatter of receiving any money, a verdict he accepted \"with satisfaction,\" and to date he has not been linked to anything illicit. but fifa's critics frequently note that blatter has stayed remarkably upright as the people around him seem to topple amid charges of bribery, conflict of interest and other unsavory activity. \"i tell you: i know mr. blatter personally, he is not corrupt,\" champagne said. \"maybe they have a few black sheep. but blatter is not corrupt.\" nonetheless, he has been surrounded by scandal. of the 24 men on the executive committee who were set to vote on the 2018 and 2022 world cup bids in december 2010, two were suspended and later removed for taking bribes before the ballot took place. blatter does not outwardly dismiss the notion that organizational change is needed, and he has attempted to bring fifa a little closer to the modern standards of business ethics and operations through the formation of ethics committees. but there remains a question of how committed he is to putting substantive changes in place. that was the reason alexandra wrage resigned from fifa's independent governance committee this year. wrage is the president of trace international, an organization that works with companies to help them raise their antibribery measures. she is an expert on compliance and best business practices and was, ostensibly, included on the fifa committee to help engineer a significant overhaul. instead, wrage described a reaction of \"indignation\" from fifa executives at any significant proposals for change. she acknowledged that blatter had made some positive moves with regard to governance adding a two-chambered investigative committee was \"a big step,\" she said but said, \"a lot of the really tough decisions, especially the ones that impacted blatter himself and the people at the highest levels, were not implemented.\" ultimately, wrage said, she felt compelled to resign from the committee because she did not sense a genuine desire for change from blatter and his staff. \"it kept appearing that the decisions that impacted the most senior people were put off,\" wrage said. \"that sort of thing happened fairly frequently: you'd make a very robust recommendation and it would get scaled back. in many ways, it's bizarre: the public perception of fifa and fifa's view of itself don't seem to connect in any way. the disconnect is pretty alarming.\" decision 2022 against that background thursday, world soccer's most powerful group will meet in fifa's gleaming, state-of-the-art offices in a quiet suburb of zurich to take a decision that could reshape the future of soccer as well as blatter's legacy. a tournament in qatar in january and february would clash with the winter olympics the new i.o.c. president, thomas bach, said monday that he had spoken with blatter and \" there would be no conflict \" and one in november and december would disrupt not only europe's top club competition, the champions league, but also play in most major european leagues. equally problematic are the broadcasting agreements fifa has signed, including a $1 billion rights deal with fox and telemundo, and recent news media reports of abuse and mistreatment of qatar's huge migrant work force. all of it piles up to be a considerable headache for blatter, who insisted as late as last year that the 2022 world cup must take place as planned in the summer. as the prevailing wind has changed direction, though, so too has blatter. some believe that qatar will be the final piece of blatter's legacy, but even that is uncertain. among the myriad criticisms levied by wrage and others against fifa is an absence of term limits on its presidency, and so it does not matter that blatter is 77. it does not matter that he has been president for 15 years. it does not matter that he said before his last election that this would be his final one. ever the politician, blatter has remained coy on his future. all that is sure is this: there is another election in 2015, and blatter may not be done.",

        "title": "supreme court appears to back u.s. on material witnesses.",
        "abstract": "washington the current supreme court is considered a hot bench, meaning one from which advocates may expect a barrage of challenging questions. but the bench was cool on wednesday at the argument of a case testing how far the government may go in using the federal material witness law to detain and interrogate people it suspects have ties to terrorism. the justices' lack of engagement at the argument probably signaled a victory for the government. neal k. katyal, the acting united states solicitor general, talked uninterrupted for extended stretches and ended his main presentation 10 minutes early. several of the questions he received from the justices seemed to seek guidance about which route the court should take in ruling for mr. katyal's client, john ashcroft , who was president george w. bush's first attorney general. the case was brought by abdullah al-kidd, a united states citizen who contends that policies set by mr. ashcroft after the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, resulted in the misuse of the material witness law to detain him. the law is meant to allow prosecutors to hold witnesses with evidence of others' crimes for fear they will not appear to testify at trial. mr. kidd contends that the law was improperly used to detain him as a suspect in a terrorism case. he was held in harsh conditions in three states for more than two weeks and was never called to testify against anyone else. the question for the supreme court was whether mr. ashcroft is immune from mr. kidd's suit either because what mr. ashcroft was accused of doing was at the core of a prosecutor's duties or because he did not violate a clearly established constitutional right. much of the limited questioning concerned which sort of immunity was more appropriate. mr. katyal argued that lawsuits seeking money from public officials were not the right way to deter the conduct mr. kidd complained about. \"improper motives are easy to allege and hard to disprove,\" he said. \"allowing such suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do their jobs.\" \"no doubt that certain individuals will be harmed,\" he added, \"but the cost of rooting out the bad apples through damages lawsuits is far worse\" in that \"it causes prosecutors to flinch in the performance of their duties.\" lee gelernt, a lawyer with the american civil liberties union, which represents mr. kidd, said that if the united states is to have a law authorizing preventive detention it should be enacted by congress and not cobbled together by prosecutors. he added that the misuse of the material witness law after the sept. 11 attacks resulted in abuses in mr. kidd's case and others. \"it went on in cities all over the country, people being held under horrendous conditions for long periods of time, interrogated about their own activities,\" he said. only justice ruth bader ginsburg seemed troubled by the conditions in which mr. kidd had been held. \"there are allegations here that this man was kept awake, the lights shining in his cell for 24 hours, kept without clothes,\" she said to mr. katyal. \"now that doesn't sound like the way one would treat someone whose testimony you want,\" she said. \"is there a remedy that he has for that obvious mistreatment?\" mr. katyal said that suits against mr. kidd's jailers may be possible but that suits against prosecutors were improper. \"to hold either the attorney general or prosecutors liable is something that would, i think, ultimately open the door to, at least there are a few hundred lawsuits at the federal level if not more,\" he said. mr. gelernt said mr. kidd should be allowed to try to prove that he would not have been arrested but for an improper motive. the problem with that theory, chief justice john g. roberts jr. responded, is that \"the allegation can so readily be made in every case under the material witness statute.\"",

        "title": "christie says no to 2012 bid, but g.o.p. keeps calling.",
        "abstract": "so many people want to talk to gov. chris christie about the 2012 presidential campaign that he probably could not drop the subject if he wanted to. not that he wants to. despite months of insisting that he will not enter the race, the new jersey governor has become an increasingly busy presence on its fringes. conservative politicians and talk-show hosts are still clamoring for him to jump in, and he has agreed to meet this month with a group of fund-raisers from iowa who want to persuade him. while republican consultants say he would be a leading contender, and journalists keep asking whether he will run, mr. christie keeps finding new and ever more provocative ways to say no. the republicans who have considered running want his imprimatur, lining up for dinner dates at the governor's mansion in princeton. candidate or not, mr. christie is a force to reckon with in the contest, someone who political analysts say could influence his party's nomination, or make a splash as a choice for running mate another prospect he rules out. the governor shows no sign of fading into the background, and by his own admission, he loves the attention. \"i'm a kid from jersey who has people asking him to run for president,\" he said last week in a radio interview , laughing off the idea that he had \"become tired and annoyed\" by the subject's coming up time and again. \"i'm thrilled by it. i just don't want to do it.\" his denials are striking enough to stoke the fire, generating still more news media coverage. he once told reporters that \"short of suicide, i don't really know what i'd have to do to convince you people that i'm not running,\" and on another occasion he told an interviewer that while he would not run, \"i already know i could win.\" last week, he posed a tart comparison with his democratic predecessor, observing that \"a few years ago, nobody from iowa was coming to new jersey to beg jon corzine to run for president of the united states .\" since january, mr. christie has played dinner host to a string of potential presidential candidates: former gov. mitt romney of massachusetts (who followed with a $25,000 contribution to the new jersey republican party ), former gov. tim pawlenty of minnesota and gov. haley barbour of mississippi , before mr. barbour decided not to enter the race. a date with another, former gov. jon m. huntsman jr. of utah , was scheduled for last week but had to be postponed, and there has been talk of a meeting with the former house speaker newt gingrich . governors, who usually control their state party machinery, are always courted by presidential candidates, particularly in the states with the earliest contests, like iowa and new hampshire . but for contenders to make the pilgrimage to new jersey not a pivotal primary state with aides in tow, for face-to-face sessions with a governor long before any votes are cast, is something else. \"there hasn't been any parallel to this, not in my memory,\" said david p. redlawsk, a political science professor at rutgers university . \"he's a hot commodity, and the candidates clearly think his endorsement would be significant. he can attract crowds and raise a lot of money. i wouldn't be surprised if they're thinking about him as a potential v.p. candidate.\" but the meetings have included no vice-presidential talk, or even much direct appealing for the governor's support, according to people who have attended some of his sessions with candidates, and who discussed them on the condition of anonymity so as not to alienate those involved. they say mr. christie listens to each candidate's presentation and asks questions about policy and political strategy. and though the governor, a former federal prosecutor, has said that presidential hopefuls must be able to handle tough questioning, these people say the tone of these exchanges is relaxed. his advisers say that while mr. christie relishes the attention, he does not court it. \"i don't think people understand how much more often we say no to invitations than we say yes,\" said mike duhaime, the governor's chief political consultant. mr. christie turned down an invitation to speak at the conservative political action conference in february and a chance to give the republican response to president obama 's state of the union address in january openings that no presidential candidate would be likely to pass up. he supports a move to switch new jersey's presidential primaries from february back to their traditional june date, potentially lessening the state's influence on nominations. the governor's political team is aware that his recent approval ratings have been fair generally in the high 40s and most new jerseyans who are interviewed say they do not want him to run for president. he is embroiled in major fights with the legislature, unions, the courts and the obama administration, and he risks alienating voters at home if his attention appears to be elsewhere. the iowans scheduled to meet with mr. christie on may 31 include wealthy business owners who raised money for gov. terry e. branstad's campaign last year, and saw the new jersey governor when he campaigned for mr. branstad. they describe themselves as focused on fiscal issues, and disappointed with the current presidential field. \"i'm going to tell him that it's a call to duty, and see if we can't persuade him,\" said one of them, gerald m. kirke. \"we started calling his people around february to see if we could get out there to see him, and they didn't rule it out, but at first they said he had no interest, or he didn't have the time. they have emphatically told us he's not running, so there's no indication we have an aperture here.\" another member of the group, denny elwell, said: \"i think he'll have to get in eventually because there will be enough pressure on him. right now, we don't have anybody who can beat obama.\" the iowans are the only republican operatives to make an organized appeal to mr. christie, but informal inquiries are common, said william j. palatucci, one of the governor's closest confidants. \"i think a lot of people think that in private they're going to get a wink or a nod, some kind of hint from me or duhaime,\" he said. \"but the answer's the same.\"",

        "title": "beyond petraeus biographer's tv interviews, a family-focused life.",
        "abstract": "washington paula broadwell became a fixture at the kabul headquarters of the american-led coalition in afghanistan soon after gen. david h. petraeus assumed command in 2010. she was seen as ambitious and a striver who aimed to join washington's national security elite, and was resented by some officers for playing up her connection to their boss. in television interviews, ms. broadwell a petraeus biographer whose affair with him led to his resignation on friday as director of central intelligence appears assertive and confident, appearing on \"the daily show\" sporting bare, toned arms that have been the subject of considerable comment on twitter and elsewhere. but back in her home city of charlotte, n.c., a far more nuanced, even ordinary, picture has emerged of the woman at the center of washington's latest sex scandal. there, neighbors say, ms. broadwell is the soccer mom, married to a radiologist, who serves her family dinner by candlelight and walks her two boys to the bus stop every morning before school. she is the nice woman in the two-story brick house who wore a costume to hand out candy on halloween. she is the friendly neighbor who organized an impromptu backyard barbecue to welcome newcomers to the neighborhood. she is the superbusy woman who raises money for veterans' support groups and takes time to mentor her friends' children especially girls by reading their school papers and introducing them to soldiers they might interview. \"it wasn't uncommon to look in their dining room at night and see the candles lit as they were eating,\" said sarah curme, a neighbor and friend. \"nobody put paula on a pedestal; it was more about paula the neighbor, the mom and the wife than it was about everything else she did.\" since news broke on friday of her extramarital affair with mr. petraeus, ms. broadwell a north dakota native whose resume lists her as valedictorian of her high school class, homecoming queen, state student council president and fitness champion at west point has become a national curiosity. news crews have converged on her home, but no one is home. ms. curme said the family was on vacation. ms. broadwell's relationship with mr. petraeus was uncovered by an f.b.i. investigation ; government officials said the inquiry began with a complaint that ms. broadwell had sent \"harassing\" e-mails to another woman who knows the retired general. that woman was identified sunday as jill kelley of tampa, fla., a friend of the petraeus family. when f.b.i. officials followed up on the complaint, they stumbled across e-mails that revealed mr. petraeus, 60, and ms. broadwell, 40, were having an extramarital romance. the two met in 2006, when general petraeus spoke at harvard university, where ms. broadwell was awarded a master's degree in public administration. the charlotte observer, in an article about her book , reported in january that when she told him of her interest in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, he gave her his business card and offered to help. soon afterward, she asked him if she could use him as a subject of her doctoral dissertation. \"petraeus agreed,\" ms. broadwell later told claudia chan , who edits a web site devoted to women and leadership, \"and i began to write an 'intellectual history' exploring how he'd developed his role as a maverick who galvanized organizational innovation.\" when president obama chose general petraeus as the new commander in afghanistan in 2010, ms. broadwell proposed turning the dissertation into a book. she teamed up with a newspaper editor, vernon loeb, now of the washington post, to write it. the observer reported that she made six trips to afghanistan, living with combat troops and conducting extensive interviews with the general. \"here she has two young kids, a husband who's a doctor, and yet ... she's writing a book of this magnitude and hardly breaking a sweat,\" the observer quoted mr. loeb as saying. but ms. broadwell told ms. chan that it was tough juggling her work and home life. \"i used to think i was invincible and could do it all,\" she said, \"but having children helped me to realize my limits.\" ms. broadwell met her husband, dr. scott broadwell, when the two were in the military and stationed in germany. she told the observer that they were both training to become ski patrollers, and described herself and her husband as \"adventure junkies.\" after they married, they decided that they would take turns choosing where to live; they moved to charlotte about three years ago with their two young sons, lucien and landon, after dr. broadwell took a job with a medical group in the city. they live in dilworth, an upscale neighborhood with old-growth trees and many craftsman-style homes that date to the 1920s. ed williams, a retired editorial page editor of the observer who lives two doors down from the broadwells, says he often sees ms. broadwell out running in the morning. \"she's kind of energetic, but not boisterous,\" mr. williams said. \"she's quiet.\" she has also thrown herself into charlotte's civic life, with an emphasis on charities that help veterans and their families. the observer reported on saturday that ms. broadwell has been a guest speaker for the world affairs council of charlotte , and recently spoke at a black-tie benefit for the patriot charities , a nonprofit group that supports wounded members of the military from the carolinas and their families. last week, the newspaper said, she attended a tandem parachute jump in charlotte for cpl. david bixler of the army, who lost both of his legs in an explosion in afghanistan. in september, during the democratic national convention in charlotte, she co-hosted a fund-raiser for wounded soldiers and persuaded jon stewart of \"the daily show\" to attend. after the revelation of ms. broadwell's affair with mr. petraeus, her friends and neighbors do not quite know what to expect next. \"we've been trying to have a book party for her and invite some people from the neighborhood,\" said mr. williams, the retired editor. \"we talked about doing it in early december. i'm not so sure that's going to go on now.\" ms. curme, who said she had been in touch with ms. broadwell by text message and e-mail on saturday, said the broadwells are \"very united and will get through\" the emotional turmoil of an infidelity that is playing out in public view. \"obviously she has made a mistake,\" ms. curme said, \"but i really do believe she is probably better equipped than about anybody i know to figure her way out of this in a really positive way, without destroying anybody. that's just not her nature. whatever has happened, i suspect paula will step up and take accountability, and nurture her family.\"",

        "title": "central bankers hear plea: turn focus to government spending.",
        "abstract": "grand teton national park, wyo. central bankers who gathered here to discuss better ways of jump-starting slow economic growth received a surprising message from their lunchtime speaker on friday: stop. you're making things worse. christopher a. sims, a nobel laureate in economic science, told the annual conference that increased government spending was required to lift the world's major economies from stagnation. the pursuit of innovations in monetary policy, he said, is diverting needed attention from the inaction of fiscal policy makers. \"so long as the legislature thinks it has no role in this problem, nothing is going to get done,\" said mr. sims, a professor at princeton. the best hope, he said, \"is that people at central banks are willing to say publicly that this is what is necessary.\" developed nations have leaned heavily on their central banks since the 2008 financial crisis. the united states, europe and japan have all relied on low interest rates to encourage increased spending by businesses and consumers even as government spending has remained relatively austere. mr. sims is among a growing number of experts who warn that this experiment has reached its limits. the central banks have pushed rates to historically low levels. the european central bank and the bank of japan have even imposed negative interest rates, effectively taxing savings to encourage spending. yet job growth and inflation remain stubbornly weak. benoit coeure, a european central bank official, drew laughter from the audience when he noted the \"good news\" that eurozone inflation had doubled last month from an annual rate of 0.1 percent up to 0.2 percent. in the united states, the federal reserve responded to the crisis more forcefully than other central banks, and the federal government initially spent more freely. yet here, too, growth remains slow, inflation remains weak and millions of middle-age people are no longer working. mohamed a. el-erian, the chief economic adviser at allianz, warned in a recent book, \" the only game in town ,\" that time was running out. if developed nations do not increase spending and pursue structural reforms in the next few years, mr. el-erian predicted, they will be locked into a new reality of slower growth. moreover, he said central banks would be handicapped in fighting future crises they have little room to cut rates should economic conditions deteriorate. \"it is dangerous to continue to focus the debate on what central banks can do,\" mr. el-erian, who is also the head of president obama's global development council , wrote saturday in an email. \"what is needed not only in the u.s. but even more in europe and japan is a policy pivot away from excessive dependence on central banks.\" central bankers profess to regard this pessimism as overstated. janet l. yellen, the fed's chairwoman, and the heads of other major central banks have repeatedly urged lawmakers to lend a hand albeit with considerable diffidence. however, they also describe their own efforts as effective even without fiscal support. they are increasingly resigned to slower growth and lower interest rates, yet they insist they still have the means by buying government debt, for instance to help reverse future downturns. \"even if average interest rates remain lower than in the past,\" ms. yellen said at the conference, \"i believe monetary policy will, under most conditions, be able to respond effectively.\" the annual meetings here , hosted by the federal reserve bank of kansas city in the shadow of the grand tetons, often mix technical discussions and loftier debates. this year, as academics presented proposals for minor improvements in the mechanics of monetary policy, some in the audience suggested that monetary policy makers should be spending less time talking about themselves. peter blair henry, the dean of the stern school of business at new york university, asked a panel of central bankers whether they were doing enough to explain the limits of their own powers, to focus the public on the importance of fiscal policy. \"everyone is sort of waiting for the next pronouncement about monetary policy when that's really not the central issue,\" mr. henry, an expert on international development, said in an interview. \"i think it's important to communicate the limitations of what central bank policies can actually do to drive long-run growth. central banks have done a real good job restoring stability, and we're at a point now where most of what needs to happen, needs to happen through structural reform.\" ms. yellen and other central bankers do make this point with some regularity, but they also tend to do it with considerable circumspection. on friday, ms. yellen waited until the final paragraphs of her speech to mention that \"fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in strengthening the u.s. economy.\" both donald j. trump, the republican presidential nominee, and his democratic opponent, hillary clinton, have called for increased government spending in areas including infrastructure . those plans, however, would require support from congress, where republicans, worried about the federal debt, have prevented spending increases in recent years. the debt already is large by historical standards. and running up the tab during a period when the economy is growing, if slowly, may make it harder to spend freely during a future recession, when the need for government stimulus is more acute. but douglas w. elmendorf, the dean of the kennedy school at harvard, argued in a recent paper written with louise sheiner, a senior fellow at the brookings institution, that the sensible solution is to spend money now and deal with the debt later. \"a rush to reduce budget deficits after 2010 was the biggest error in this downturn,\" mr. elmendorf, former head of the congressional budget office, said in a may presentation on the nation's economic woes. mario draghi, the head of the european central bank, chose this conference two years ago to declare that european governments should increase fiscal spending even as the bank expanded its own stimulus campaign. (such spending would be \"helpful,\" he said, in the understated language of a central banker.) but that speech and subsequent pleas have not produced any noticeable effect on germany, the country whose trade surplus is at the heart of europe's problems. at this year's conference, mr. coeure described the efforts of european governments as \"half-baked and halfhearted.\" but he made clear that the e.c.b. would press on by itself. \"i would argue that this fundamentally doesn't impair our ability to achieve our objective, but it has a strong impact on the way we do it,\" he said. haruhiko kuroda, the governor of the bank of japan, expressed a similar mix of helplessness and optimism. japan has struggled with low inflation and slow growth for decades, and the bank's recent campaign to address the problem is perhaps the most aggressive of any developed nation. yet the japanese government has undermined those efforts, for example by imposing a large tax increase. \"i agree that monetary policy cannot do all things without the help of fiscal policy and structural policies,\" mr. kuroda said on saturday. asked what could be done to secure such help, he said that he met with the prime minister once or twice a month. \"in that sense,\" he said, \"the bank of japan is provided the opportunity to speak up.\"",

        "abstract": "it was near midnight when john coster-mullen , the author of \" atom bombs: the top secret inside story of little boy and fat man ,\" was scrutinizing one image among hundreds newly released by los alamos, the birthplace of the bomb . first, he glanced at the scientists assembling what they called \"the gadget,\" a spherical test device five feet in diameter. then, atop a wooden crate nearby, he noticed a small, blocky object, nondescript except for the role he suddenly realized it played: it was a uranium slug that held the bomb's fuel. in july 1945, its detonation lit up the new mexican desert and sent out shock waves that begot a new era. \"i let out a scream,\" mr. coster-mullen said. \"my son thought i woke up the whole neighborhood. before, they had never shown that slug. and here it was on top of the crate in all its glory. i just about had a coronary.\" it was 2009. he quickly assessed the slug as 5 inches wide and 8.75 inches long, and soon after incorporated the photograph into a revised edition of his book. waves of declassified photographs and movies from the nation's push to make little boy and fat man the world's first atom bombs are exciting not only to mr. coster-mullen but a generation less familiar with the nation's atomic past. image fat man and little boy revisited newly available photographs and movies have made the dawn of the nuclear weapons era go viral, providing a history lesson to a new generation. \"they hit geek culture and go viral,\" said alex wellerstein, a historian of science at stevens institute of technology in hoboken, n.j. early this year, dr. wellerstein posted on his blog and on reddit, a social news site, an annotated silent movie a little more than 11 minutes long that showed scientists and soldiers preparing fat man and loading the weapon onto a b-29 aircraft that would soon take off for nagasaki, japan; the bombing instantly killed an estimated 40,000 people there. the movie was viewed more than 100,000 times in just one day on reddit, and received 700 comments. among the posted questions: did the men know what they were doing? probably so, dr. wellerstein replied on his blog, \"because they knew what had happened at hiroshima.\" a few years ago, the los alamos national laboratory started posting historical pictures on flickr, a photo-sharing site. the lab's history section now has 515 images like early bombs and scientists and rapidly expanding fireballs and rising mushroom clouds. the set includes the gadget photograph from 1945 that left mr. coster-mullen agog. a recent wave of internet photographs has featured little boy and fat man preparations; one shows a man signing the nose of the nagasaki bomb, and another is a tail fin close-up of scrawled names and home states, including wisconsin and new york. holly reed, a photo expert at the national archives , the source of those images, said they went public in 1997 but received much attention recently when they were widely described online as newly released. \"there's a kind of barrier between what's out there and what's known,\" dr. wellerstein said. with the rise of global networks, he added, \"there's a real opportunity for these to go viral.\"",

        "title": "new york state's decision on hydrofracking will await health review.",
        "abstract": "after four years of study by the state, the cuomo administration now says its decision on whether to allow high-volume hydraulic fracturing in new york will have to wait until it conducts a review of the potential public health effects of the controversial natural gas drilling process. on thursday, joseph martens , commissioner of the state department of environmental conservation , announced that he had asked the health commissioner, dr. nirav shah , to assess his department's analysis of the health effects closely. mr. martens said he was responding to widespread concerns that the state had not adequately addressed potential health consequences in its environmental assessments as it moved toward a decision on whether to permit the drilling process and what rules would govern it. \"only after this evaluation is completed will a decision be made about whether to permit high-volume hydraulic fracturing in new york,\" he said. \"obviously, if there was a public health concern that could not be addressed, we would not proceed.\" the process, also known as hydrofracking, involves pumping vast amounts of water laced with chemicals into underground shale deposits, under high pressure, to release natural gas. gov. andrew m. cuomo has been under pressure to ban the drilling process, or at least to hold off on a decision until more research is done. mr. martens said many of the 80,000 public comments the state had received on hydrofracking during its deliberations focused on the possible harm to public health. among the areas of concern are the contamination of drinking-water supplies, air pollution produced by the drilling equipment and the danger of accidents from increased truck traffic. state legislators, medical societies and health experts have called for a thorough health assessment. last month, members of major environmental groups met with mr. martens to press for an independent review by medical experts before any regulations are made final and drilling is allowed to start. in his statement on thursday, however, mr. martens rejected the idea of commissioning an outside study, calling it \"an inappropriate delegation of a governmental responsibility.\" \"to suggest private interests or academic experts bring more independence to the process than government is exactly wrong,\" he added. but he also said that dr. shah could solicit advice from \"the most qualified outside experts\" in his review. mr. martens's statement did not say how long the health study might take, and officials with the environmental department did not return calls. the state has been studying the possibility of opening up the marcellus shale to natural gas drilling since 2008, and released a revised draft report on environmental effects last year. in moving to conduct a separate health review, mr. martens said, the state is seeking to prepare \"the most legally defensible\" environmental report in the event of any litigation that could ensue if the state allows fracking to proceed. kate sinding, a senior attorney with the natural resources defense council, said her organization would have preferred an independent study. \"this is not exactly what we were asking for,\" she said. \"but if they really solicit the input of truly independent experts as well as hear the concerns of the public, this could provide real value.\" she suggested that the state health review could take a few months or more than a year, depending on how much work the environmental department has already done on studying the potential health effects. the reaction from the gas industry was resigned. \"while we're extremely disappointed in yet another delay, we have full faith and confidence in the d.e.c.'s analysis and decision,\" said brad gill, executive director of the industry group the independent oil and gas association of new york.",

        "abstract": "moscow one of russia 's tabloid tv channels began a news bulletin tuesday with a breathless report about a major \"international criminal gang\" freshly rolled up in the moscow region. the report included typically jerky shots from an overnight police dragnet officers in combat fatigues and black balaclavas frisking suspects who were spread-eagled against vehicles or pinned to the ground. ample evidence was on display, too: giant warehouses and transport trucks stacked with the gang's shrink-wrapped contraband. heroin? marijuana? weapons? nope. more like edam. that's right. cheese. when the russian government banned dairy products from a host of nations, including the united states and members of the european union, last year in response to western economic sanctions imposed over russia's military meddling in ukraine, president vladimir v. putin said the restrictions would create a profitable opportunity for domestic industries. instead they appear to have created an opening for forgers and smugglers. the \"cheese ring\" was busted with an estimated $30 million worth of the stuff, nearly 500 tons, according to the interior ministry police. image a bulldozer in belgorod, russia, destroyed cheese and other food that was said to violate russia&aposs ban on european food imports. credit federal service for veterinary and phytosanitary surveillance, via reuters the cheese was produced locally with western rennet , an enzyme base used in cheese production that is now banned in russia. the \"criminal gang\" had been peddling its illicit cheese since march, according to a police statement, selling it to supermarket chains and other distributors in and around moscow and st. petersburg. the police raided 17 sites, including residences and warehouses, the statement said, and arrested six people, who are to face charges of fraud and other crimes. the raids were part of a new government effort to make sure that the ban is respected and a tacit admission that it had been subverted. the government also opened a hotline on tuesday, encouraging russians to snitch on suspected food scofflaws, and it generated more than 50 calls the first day, the prosecutor general's office announced. about two weeks ago, tons of cheese, fruits and other goods were either burned or buried on the orders of mr. putin. that prompted some applause, but also grumbling that the food should have been donated to the poor in a country where food prices have doubled, and in some cases tripled, because of sanctions and the nosediving value of the ruble. the latest cheese bust produced mostly giggles across social media, with one commenter noting that during american prohibition in the 1920s and early '30s, smuggling liquor become a lucrative industry that spawned the word \"bootlegger.\" the writer mused whether there was such a thing as a \"cheeselegger.\"",

        "abstract": "a long-simmering dispute over the use of the ice rink at riverbank state park in harlem burst into the open under the bright skies of sunday afternoon, with protesters from a girls' figure skating organization charging that hockey teams, made up mostly of boys, dominated the ice time. waving homemade signs, members of the organization, figure skating in harlem , which has provided skating opportunities to local girls for almost 15 years, gathered at the park's entrance, along with some of their parents and others. they said the girls got only four and a half hours a week to practice; that, they said, has forced some parents to send their daughters to other rinks. \"my daughter isn't getting enough ice time,\" said ruth hernandez, 37. \"it's very unfair.\" her daughter, thalyia thompson, 10, has been a member of the group since she was 6. though they live just blocks away, ms. hernandez said the restricted schedule meant that thalyia had to travel a total of two hours every sunday for coaching at chelsea piers. other parents said their daughters had to go as far away as the world ice arena in flushing, queens, for sufficient practice time. officials from riverbank state park say the problems stem from high demand both inside and outside the community. the rink, which is open from november to march, depending on the weather, currently allots practice time to the general public, to private permit holders, and to riverbank youth ice hockey , a program for boys and girls. members of figure skating in harlem say they need at least 10 hours a week, either after school or on weekends. the group currently has 130 members, but parents say it has had to put another 100 girls on a waiting list because of the scant ice time. \"we'd like to be able to give them more hours, but there's only a finite number of hours,\" said dan keefe, a spokesman for the state office of parks, recreation and historic preservation . \"it would be unfair for us to kick off somebody else,\" he added. mr. keefe said the times the figure skaters were asking for conflicted with the schedules of other private permit holders, like st. david's school on the upper east side, the fieldston school in the northwest bronx and other private schools, each of which is getting 1.5 hours a week of the prime practice slots between 4 and 7 p.m. a letter written by the park's director, reggie magwood, to sharon cohen, the founder and executive director of figure skating in harlem, said her group had more than 30 percent of the available time for permit holders. the rest of the time was dedicated to public skating and practice for riverbank youth ice hockey. the protesters claimed there was a gender disparity in the allotted ice time, arguing that riverbank's hockey program as well as the private schools' teams are predominantly male. \"it's a real equity issue. we already know girls get the short end of the stick in sports,\" said peggy shepard, executive director of we act for environmental justice . she pointed to part of what had long been a subject of controversy in harlem: the north river sewage treatment plant. the park, which runs between 137th and 145th streets, was built on top of the plant. \"the park was a benefit for the community for hosting the sewage treatment plant,\" said ms. shepard, who in the 1990s filed suit against the dinkins administration over environmental concerns about the plant. not everyone agreed with the protesters. windell williams, 49, a filmmaker from harlem, said his son, takashi, 7, played ice hockey at the rink. mr. williams denied that the team, or the park, discriminated against females. he added that his daughter, india, 5, planned to join the hockey team next year. mr. williams felt that all teams using the rink, private or not, had a right to be there. \"this is a state park,\" he said. \"if there are kids that go to private schools, public schools, it doesn't matter.\"",

        "abstract": "on a recent sunny afternoon, lucas capra, a student at columbia, traded in his usual earthbound fitness routine and took to the skies, tarzan style. but no vines were required. mr. capra was at the traveling rings , a contraption that sits in a giant sandbox known as hudson beach in riverside park, manhattan. of all the fitness equipment scattered across the city, the rings offer a distinctively uplifting exercise experience. \"i like to come here for about 30 minutes and treat it like a workout,\" said mr. capra, 33, who is from los angeles and picked up his skills at the more famous traveling rings in santa monica, calif. it has been 10 years since the ribbon-cutting ceremony that welcomed the traveling rings to riverside park, but this little stretch still feels relatively off the radar; even longtime new yorkers are surprised when they happen upon them. the rings were donated by dorlene kaplan , a resident of the upper west side, who said she had fond memories of using similar ones as a youngster in the 1940s at her school playground in miami beach, fla. ms. kaplan said that an article about the rings' home in santa monica inspired her to help create a place like it in new york. she contacted the department of parks and recreation and the riverside park conservancy , and officials found a suitable spot. in 2005 ms. kaplan added a set of rings for children next to the adult set. sandwiched between ball fields and in view of the hudson river, the giant metal framework consists of 10 metal rings hung by swivel chains about seven feet above the sand. the object is to grab one ring and swing to the next, from one end to the other and back again, without touching the ground. it requires strength, agility, determination and, most of all, practice. image meagan stanton, 9, on the sets of traveling rings. credit emon hassan for the new york times melissa kimiadi, 27, said that when she arrived at the rings in 2009, a big obstacle was stage fright. \"i was really scared of people watching me,\" she said. \"i could only do two or three rings at a time.\" she practiced early in the day, when fewer people were around, and could eventually travel across and back. now a weekly regular, she is one of many who offer encouragement to first-timers. in fact, it's better to learn with other ring swingers, who can offer advice. one misconception is that the rings demand superior upper-body strength. many newcomers mistakenly try to hoist themselves up with their biceps. it's better to use a firm grip and hang with straight arms as you swing. warming up first is also recommended: \"i like to swing on one ring back and forth,\" said joseph belcastro, 30, who started using the rings in 2012. \"i'll swing with one hand and then the other, then with both hands. then i might swing between two rings for a bit, before going the whole length.\" aside from the feeling of flying, those who spend time on the rings are also improving flexibility and strengthening back and core muscles, according to hector salazar, a program director and gymnastics coach at chelsea piers, the sports complex in manhattan. \"when swinging ring to ring, you are primarily using your lats,\" mr. salazar said, referring to the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back. \"if you raise your legs as you swing, or swing with your legs bent in a tuck position, you are definitely going to be working your abs as well.\" hand health is an important factor, and many people apply chalk to help reduce friction and the possibility of skin tears. frequent visitors also invest in ring grips used by gymnasts, which can be purchased online for $40 to $60 a pair, depending on the style. \"the thing i love about the rings is that it's healthful exercise, and it's noncompetitive,\" ms. kaplan said. \"everyone develops their own style, and everyone helps everyone out.\"",

        "abstract": "dr. rita levi-montalcini , a nobel prize -winning neurologist who discovered critical chemical tools that the body uses to direct cell growth and build nerve networks, opening the way for the study of how those processes can go wrong in diseases like dementia and cancer, died on sunday at her home in rome. she was 103. her death was announced by mayor gianni alemanno of rome. \"i don't use these words easily, but her work revolutionized the study of neural development, from how we think about it to how we intervene,\" said dr. gerald d. fishbach, a neuroscientist and professor emeritus at columbia. scientists had virtually no idea how embryo cells built a latticework of intricate connections to other cells when dr. levi-montalcini began studying chicken embryos in the bedroom of her house in turin, italy, during world war ii. after years of obsessive study, much of it at washington university in st. louis with dr. viktor hamburger , she found a protein that, when released by cells, attracted nerve growth from nearby developing cells. in the early 1950s, she and dr. stanley cohen , a biochemist also at washington university, isolated and described the chemical, known as nerve growth factor and in the process altered the study of cell growth and development. scientists soon realized that the protein gave them a new way to study and understand disorders of neural growth, like cancer, or of degeneration, like alzheimer's disease, and to potentially develop therapies. in the years after the discovery, dr. levi-montalcini, dr. cohen and others described a large family of such growth-promoting agents, each of which worked to regulate the growth of specific cells. one, called epidermal growth factor and discovered by dr. cohen, plays a central role in breast cancer; in part by studying its behavior, scientists developed drugs to combat the abnormal growth. in 1986, dr. levi-montalcini and dr. cohen shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their work. dr. cohen, now an emeritus professor at vanderbilt university, said dr. levi-montalcini possessed a rare combination of intuition and passion, as well as biological knowledge. \"she had this feeling for what was happening biologically,\" he said. \"she was an intuitive observer, and she saw that something was making these nerve connections grow and was determined to find out what it was.\" one of four children, rita levi-montalcini was born in turin on april 22, 1909, to adamo levi, an engineer, and adele montalcini, a painter, both italian jews who traced their roots to the roman empire. in keeping with the victorian customs of the time, mr. levi discouraged his three daughters from entering college, fearing that it would interfere with their lives as wives and mothers. it was not a future that rita wanted. she had decided to become a doctor and told her father so. \"he listened, looking at me with that serious and penetrating gaze of his that caused me such trepidation,\" she wrote in her autobiography, \"in praise of imperfection\" (1988). he also agreed to support her. she graduated summa cum laude from the university of turin medical school in 1936. two years later, mussolini issued a manifesto barring non-aryan italians from having professional careers. she began her research anyway, setting up a small laboratory in her home to study chick embryos, inspired by the work of dr. hamburger, a prominent researcher in st. louis who also worked with the embryos. during world war ii, the family fled turin for the countryside, and in 1943 the invasion by germany forced them to florence. the family returned at the close of the war, in 1945, and dr. hamburger soon invited dr. levi-montalcini to work for a year in his lab at washington university. she stayed on, becoming an associate professor in 1956 and a full professor in 1958. in 1962, she helped establish the institute of cell biology in rome and became its first director. she retired from washington university in 1977, becoming a guest professor and splitting her time between rome and st. louis. italy honored her in 2001 by making her a senator for life. an elegant presence, confident and passionate, she was a sought-after speaker until late in life. \"at 100, i have a mind that is superior thanks to experience than when i was 20,\" she said in 2009. she never married and had no children. in addition to her autobiography, she was the author or co-author of dozens of research studies and received numerous professional awards, including the national medal of science . \"it is imperfection not perfection that is the end result of the program written into that formidably complex engine that is the human brain,\" dr. levi-montalcini wrote in her autobiography, \"and of the influences exerted upon us by the environment and whoever takes care of us during the long years of our physical, psychological and intellectual development.\"",

        "abstract": "miami six weeks after being released from jail on bond, george zimmerman, who is facing second-degree murder charges in the death of trayvon martin , is back behind bars. mr. zimmerman turned himself in to the authorities in sanford, fla., early sunday afternoon, according to a blog post from his lawyer, mark m. o'mara. a seminole county circuit court judge, kenneth r. lester jr., revoked his bond during a hearing on friday and gave him 48 hours to surrender. in revoking the bond, judge lester found that mr. zimmerman had misled the court about his finances, with the help of his wife, during his april bond hearing. at the time, mr. zimmerman had access to as much as $135,000 from a paypal account that collected donations through a legal defense web site. but mr. zimmerman's wife testified that she was unaware of how much money had been collected through the site. because it was believed that mr. zimmerman had no money, he was released on a low bond of $150,000. at the hearing on friday, prosecutors presented transcripts of telephone conversations between mr. zimmerman, who was in jail at the time of the talks, and his wife. the two were discussing in code what to do with the money, prosecutors said. mr. o'mara said that he was unaware of the money at the time of the first hearing and that he planned to ask for another bond hearing so that mr. zimmerman could explain himself to the judge. \"judge lester runs a very tight courtroom, as well he should,\" mr. o'mara said after the ruling. \"he didn't believe they were being as straightforward and honest as he wanted them to.\" the death of mr. martin, 17, on feb. 26 created a national controversy after the police declined to arrest mr. zimmerman for more than a month, raising questions about racial profiling and florida's self-defense law. mr. zimmerman said that the unarmed teenager attacked him and that he was in such fear for his life that he was forced to shoot mr. martin. mr. zimmerman had a license to carry a concealed weapon. while witnesses heard shouts and saw figures fighting outside their windows, the rain and darkness made it difficult to see clearly. as a result, mr. zimmerman's account of what happened that evening as mr. martin walked through a gated community in sanford back to the home of his father's girlfriend is critical to mr. zimmerman's self-defense case. judge lester's reversal on the bond will allow prosecutors to cast doubt on mr. zimmerman's version of events in the martin case, experts said. \"the fact george zimmerman was dishonest is very important because his credibility is the most important thing in this entire case,\" benjamin crump, the martin family lawyer, said after the court session on friday. mr. o'mara said that mr. zimmerman's safety was still a concern. he has been in hiding since shortly after the shooting. while he was in jail awaiting his april bond hearing, he was kept in solitary confinement to protect him from other prisoners. \"we are very concerned about safety still, and we will maintain that concern,\" mr. o'mara said after learning his client would be forced to return to jail. \"there are ongoing threats and concerns and complaints. i don't know where along the spectrum they become true threats. we have begun to process and analyze a number of the statements he has given to the police.\"",

        "abstract": "the crowd sat in a circle at the edge of battery park on friday, as two young women held up a large map of the financial district that had been divided into sectors and marked with assembly points. they explained the plan for early monday: protesters will gather at those points, then converge in an attempt to surround the new york stock exchange. \"we want to to block all the access points leading to the stock exchange by linking arms and sitting,\" said one of the women displaying the map. over the next hour or so, those in the meeting discussed plans for the surrounding tactic, called the people's wall . one man announced that he represented a group of 30 to 40 people willing to stand in an intersection near the stock exchange. another said he was part of a group that intended to hold a \"roving birthday party\" near wall street replete with confetti, cake and streamers. as the occupy wall street protests reach their first anniversary on monday, numerous activities have been planned to highlight issues like the presence of corporate money in politics, the foreclosure of homes and the type of risky speculation that caused jpmorgan chase to lose as much as $9 billion this year betting on credit derivatives. \"the issues that brought us together a year ago haven't gone away,\" said amin husain, an organizer of the recent meeting. \"things have only gotten worse.\" over the last few months, protesters have planned three days of events, using the title \"all roads lead to wall street,\" including marches, a rosh hashana service near zuccotti park and a concert in foley square featuring members of the dead kennedys, sonic youth and rage against the machine. in a reprise of a tactic used in the spring , some protesters said they were sleeping at night on sidewalks outside of banks. as the protesters began gathering on saturday, the police were present, too. when a crowd embarked upon a sidewalk march from washington square to zuccotti park on saturday night, the police arrested about 15 people. susan howard of the national lawyers guild said that she had reports of an additional 22 arrests on saturday, including 17 near trinity church, where protesters have been sleeping. she added that there were reports of 13 arrests near city hall early sunday morning. later sunday morning, witnesses said, the police arrested a small number of people during a march to protest the construction of a natural gas pipeline on the west side of manhattan. just after the marchers arrived at foley square, police arrested an organizer, aaron black. planning for what became the occupy protests began in the summer of 2011 when a canadian magazine, adbusters , called for people to \"flood into lower manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy wall street.\" the police sealed off the heart of wall street last sept. 17 and a few hundred protesters were able to set foot there only briefly . but the tents and kitchens eventually appeared nearby, in zuccotti park, and that camp was followed by more than 100 others across the country and overseas. in the weeks that followed, a signature phrase used by the protesters to refer to themselves, \"the 99 percent,\" became part of the political lexicon, and the topic of financial inequity became popular nationally. and zuccotti park, with its library, kitchen, clothing dispensary and bicycle-provided energy , became the center point of a populist movement that steered clear of both major political parties. the police sometimes arrested protesters in large numbers and in controversial circumstances. then, in mid-november, hundreds of officers cleared zuccotti park, arresting about 200 people in the process and preventing many journalists from observing the operation clearly. without a central gathering spot to draw participants and attention, the occupy movement became less visible. some people drifted away, exhausted by the effort of organizing. some used connections formed at occupy gatherings to join other projects, disrupting the auctions of foreclosed homes, participating in protests opposing the construction of a natural gas pipeline under the hudson river that would terminate in the west village, or planning a campaign to unify people affected by debt. while such undertakings continue, organizers said the anniversary presented a chance to reinvigorate participants who had not gathered for a large-scale public demonstration since may day. \"we want to show the world we are still here,\" said brendan burke, an organizer. \"and we still have momentum.\"",

        "abstract": "on arthur avenue, a group of men piled out of pasquale's rigoletto restaurant onto the sidewalk to pay their respects to a sudden local hero. \"anthony, we love you,\" they shouted across the street. they summed up the local sentiment about a man, anthony spinelli, celebrated for protecting his livelihood. on wednesday, mr. spinelli pulled one of two licensed guns in the store, and shot one of the three people suspected of trying to rob his arthur avenue jewelry store at gunpoint. the bronx neighborhood seemed energized by the event, which people here saw as a testament to the toughness of one of the last italian neighborhoods in new york city. \"you don't come in and try to take a man's livelihood,\" said nick lousido, who called himself a neighborhood regular. \"his family's store has 50 years on this block, they're going to come in and rob him?\" on thursday, mr. spinelli, 49, had returned to his shop and sized up the broken front windows and the mess inside. he said that a man and woman had entered his store, and the man had held a gun to his head while the woman had gone through jewelry drawers and stuffed jewelry into a bag. he said he had feared for his life, and that he was still shaken. \"you go into survival mode,\" he said. \"you think of the other people in your life. my birthday's coming up, and i thought i may not live to see my birthday.\" mr. spinelli shot a third person who was outside the store, apparently acting as a lookout, the police said. the armed robber inside had forced him to open a safe, the police said, which was where he kept a pistol. holding a gun, he chased the robbers out. the two people who had been in the store jumped into a nearby car and escaped, but the third person, steven hall, 43, fell to the sidewalk after being shot in the leg. he was in stable condition at st. barnabas hospital, and has not yet been charged. at a news conference on thursday, the police commissioner, raymond w. kelly, said the police conferred with prosecutors and decided that charging mr. spinelli criminally was not \"appropriate under the circumstances.\" \"he was threatened with the use of deadly force and he responded, and citizens, you know, have certain obligations under the law, and he did not violate the responsibilities of obligations that citizens have under the penal law,\" mr. kelly said. however, mr. spinelli was given a summons on an administrative code violation related to the gun he fired; it was licensed in westchester county, not in new york city. on thursday, mr. spinelli did not strut or brag or gloat. he did not have to. the trash-talking was done by a contingent of locals who milled around the store as if taking a victory lap. they praised mr. spinelli as a hero. \"they picked on the wrong guy, and they got what they deserved,\" said a 59-year-old man who refused to give his name but said he was a lifelong resident of arthur avenue. \"of all the neighborhoods in the city, they picked this one? bad move. the way we grew up here, you don't take nothing from us. let them come back again. you'll find them swimming with the fishes.\" like other residents, he spoke of the audacity of \"outsiders\" coming into the tight-knit neighborhood and robbing a store in broad daylight, on a bustling block dense with restaurants, bakeries and cheese shops. next door to mr. spinelli's shop is m & m painter supplies, which has photographs of pope john paul ii and mother teresa next to a paint color chart on the wall. \"he's a very brave man,\" said the store owner, ernie verino. \"he had the gun, and it takes guts to use it.\"",

        "title": "mubarak is on life support, egypt security officials say.",
        "abstract": "cairo former president hosni mubarak 's health deteriorated rapidly and he was rushed to a military hospital on tuesday, adding to the uncertainty gripping the nation as the ousted strongman's longtime opponents, the muslim brotherhood , battled his onetime allies in the military for political power. there were conflicting reports about mr. mubarak's condition. government officials and the state news agency initially said that mr. mubarak, 84, had suffered cardiac arrest and a stroke in prison and had been declared \"clinically dead\" after being taken to a military hospital overlooking the nile. other reports said he had been placed on life support. but by early wednesday, an interior ministry spokesman said he was in critical condition but alive. mr. mubarak had been in a prison medical ward since the beginning of the month, when he was given a life sentence in connection with the killing of demonstrators during the 18 days of protests that ended his rule. the news of his failing health spread quickly through tahrir square, the birthplace of the uprising, where tens of thousands of people were protesting the military council governing egypt . in recent days, the generals had moved to seize the kind of uncontested authority that the former president wielded during his nearly three decades in power. the confusion over his health injected new volatility into the country's growing political and constitutional crisis, even as the two candidates to replace mr. mubarak as president both declared themselves the winners of the weekend's election. analysts marveled that mr. mubarak had lost consciousness at the climactic moment of the struggle over the future of the system he had defined for so long, and just two days after the vote to choose his successor. \"it is very shakespearean,\" said diaa rashwan, an analyst at al ahram center, a state-financed research institute. \"to himself, he is eternal. there can be nobody after him. he does not want to hear the name of his successor.\" on monday, mohamed morsi , a brotherhood leader, said he had won egypt's first competitive presidential election, beating ahmed shafik , mr. mubarak's last prime minister, with 52 percent of the vote. the votes were counted publicly at the polling stations, and egyptian state news media reported the same count as the brotherhood. official vote results are expected to be announced this week, but on tuesday, mr. shafik disputed several of the tallies, including those reported in the state news media, that forecast mr. morsi as the winner. a spokesman for mr. shafik, ahmad sarhan, said without explanation that he had won with 51.5 percent of the vote. but that announcement seemed another tactic in a battle that began before voters went to the polls. last week, the generals dissolved parliament, which was dominated by the brotherhood, saying the move was justified because of a decision by a court of judges appointed by mr. mubarak. the generals also proceeded to issue their own interim constitution, entrenching their power while all but eviscerating the authority of the new president. the interim constitution also provided the generals and the mubarak-appointed judiciary with broad sway over the drafting of egypt's next permanent constitution. former president jimmy carter , whose carter center monitored the election, said in a statement on tuesday he was \"deeply troubled by the undemocratic turn that egypt has taken.\" the center expressed its \"grave concern about the broader political and constitutional context, which calls into question the meaning and purpose of the elections.\" mr. carter said that in contrast to the first round of voting last month, some international observers had been subjected to \"heightened scrutiny and intimidation from military personnel\" during last weekend's vote. \"there was a small but notable pattern of intimidation of carter center witnesses,\" mr. carter said. the military filmed observers at several polling places, and one international observer felt coerced to make positive statements about the process. mr. carter said he was also concerned about the limitations put on his teams' ability to monitor the vote and the ballot counting. the \"restrictions are contrary to the core principles of credible and effective election observation,\" he said in the statement. \"the carter center will not witness future elections in such circumstances.\" but the brotherhood was not about to walk away, and it vowed to use the legitimacy of the election to rally the public and fight for power. it called for large street protests until the generals backed down, and on tuesday tens of thousands of protesters poured into tahrir square in response. as the crowd swelled, a protest leader issued a warning to the military, whose forces had surrounded the parliament building to prevent elected members from entering. \"we're giving the forces now standing in front of the parliament until the official results are announced,\" he said, referring to the official election count. \"after the official results, if one soldier is standing there \" he said, his voice drowned out by the crowd. \"the struggle starts now,\" said mohammed gamal, one of the protesters. \"the people's legitimacy will not be canceled out by the greed of old generals.\" as mr. gamal spoke, mr. mubarak was being transferred by ambulance to a hospital. officials and the state news media said that his health had deteriorated rapidly, that he had gone into cardiac arrest and that he needed defibrillation , before suffering the stroke. mr. mubarak was last seen in public 17 days ago when he was sentenced to life. though the judge had pronounced him responsible for a \"dark, dark, dark\" era of crimes and said he was broadly responsible for the killings, the verdict was followed by days of street protests. it appeared the judge paved the way for mr. mubarak to appeal by saying that prosecutors had shown no evidence linking mr. mubarak to the killings. his questionable conviction, and earlier reports that mr. mubarak might be released from the hospital because of his health, became a major issue in the runoff to succeed him. his health had also declined rapidly after his sentencing, when he was flown by helicopter from the courthouse to a hospital ward in a notorious prison where his government's political prisoners had served their sentences. the subject of mr. mubarak's health was a taboo subject, punishable by prison time, when he was president. the flood of reports after his imprisonment led many to speculate that the ruling generals were testing the public reaction in case they decided to move the former president out of prison to the relative comfort of the military hospital. mr. mubarak's lawyer told cnn on tuesday that his wife, suzanne mubarak, was by his side, and he expressed anger that egypt's military rulers had not moved him to the hospital sooner. it will be their responsibility \"if he dies,\" the lawyer said. in tahrir square, the news of mr. mubarak's health was met with familiar doubts. \"they say mubarak really died,\" said hatem moustafa, 22. \"maybe this time it is really true.\" but he was not convinced. \"i think the military council is saying this so that we will leave tahrir square,\" mr. moustafa said. \"they would say anything to get us to leave the square.\"",

        "abstract": "london (ap) roger federer turned his high-profile, season-ending match against rafael nadal on sunday into little more than an exhibition. federer gave nadal little chance to mount a challenge in their 22nd meeting, winning his fifth season-ending title, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, at the atp world tour finals. federer won 92 percent of the points played on his first serve in the final and lost only 13 points on serve in the entire match. \"i was able to stay offensive; rallies were never that long,\" said federer, who has won the season-ending tournament in houston, shanghai and london. \"that kind of maybe frustrated him.\" the top-ranked nadal, who won the french open , wimbledon and the united states open this year, was able to break federer once in the second set, but he appeared to tire as the match wore on. on saturday, nadal spent more then three hours and three sets beating andy murray to reach the final of the tournament for the first time. \"i know i didn't spoil his vacation after this because he's had an amazing year,\" federer said. \"a year that any player dreams of.\" nadal is now 14-8 against federer, who swept novak djokovic on saturday to reach the final. in grand slam finals, nadal is 5-2 against federer, but federer has beaten nadal all three times they have faced each other in the final tournament of the season. in the first set sunday at o2 arena, federer lost only three points on his serve and broke nadal once. the decisive shift came early in the third set with nadal serving and trailing, 2-1. he took a 40-15 lead when federer sent a return long, but federer then reeled off the next four points the last when nadal sent a forehand wide to earn the break and essentially end nadal's chances of winning. on match point, federer hit a forehand winner on the line, but the crowd, which apparently thought the ball was out, grew quiet. then nadal started going to the net to shake hands with federer, who raised his arms in victory to set off a standing ovation. \"everybody saw the match of yesterday, so everybody's free to think his own opinion,\" nadal said. \"i'm not going to say i lost the match because i was tired. what i'm going to say and what i feel is i lost the match because i played against a very good roger federer in one of his favorite surfaces. and when he's playing like this, it's very difficult to stop him, no?\"",

        "title": "liberty relying on epiphanny prince to return to her old ways.",
        "abstract": "once upon a lifetime ago, epiphanny prince scored 113 points in a high school basketball game. her phenomenal performance in 2006 broke a record set by cheryl miller, who had scored 105 points. nearly a decade later, the 27-year-old prince has become the catalyst for an inspired playoff push by the liberty. with a young team driven by prince and tina charles, the liberty, largely ignored and marginalized by the news media, are in position to scream for attention. in february, prince was traded to the liberty from the chicago sky in exchange for cappie pondexter. the deal has worked out for both teams. pondexter is from chicago, prince from new york, and the sky and the liberty could meet in the w.n.b.a.'s eastern conference finals. who should get the credit for bringing prince home? regardless of whether general manager kristin bernert made the call or whether it was the team president isiah thomas, prince's presence has been a revelation. the liberty, who begin their playoff run on friday at madison square garden, are the top seed in the eastern conference for the first time since 2002 and have clinched home-court advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in team history. prince is not the only reason for the liberty's success. charles is a perennial candidate for the most valuable player award, and carolyn swords, in her first season back after sitting out a season with a variety of injuries, has given the liberty a tough inside presence, both scoring and rebounding. but prince, who grew up at the ingersoll houses in fort greene, brooklyn, has given the liberty the look and feel of a professional team that belongs at the garden. she missed the first 10 games of the season because of her basketball obligations in russia, where she has played in recent off-seasons. the liberty went 6-4, but since her return, they have gone 17-7. without prince, charles averaged 15.1 points per game and shot 38.7 percent from the field. with prince, charles averaged 18.9 points per game and shot 49.4 percent from the field. but the impact of prince, who has averaged 15 points a game, goes beyond numbers. \"what she brings us is the spirit of new york basketball,\" the veteran liberty guard candice wiggins said. wiggins, who won a w.n.b.a. title as a member of the minnesota lynx, called prince \"hands down one of the most talented players that i have watched or witnessed.\" after a recent practice, prince said, \"whatever they ask me to do, i'll do.\" that is all well and good, but liberty coach bill laimbeer wants more from prince. asked what he wanted her to do, laimbeer smiled and said, \"show me the 113.\" \"she's a reluctant great player,\" he said. \"she could be so much better if she wanted to go out there and be the star.\" laimbeer, who was named the w.n.b.a.'s coach of the year on thursday, continued, \"how do you score 113 points in a high school game and don't come out and try to drop 30 every game on somebody's head?\" the answer is complicated and has a lot to do with evolution. my first exposure to prince came in january 2005, when her murry bergtraum high school team beat my daughter's team by dozens of points and prince scored her usual 45 or 50. her evolution over the next decade would be dramatic. it had little to do with basketball skills and more to with life brooklyn to rutgers to russia and learning to do whatever it took to persevere. \"really just becoming a professional,\" prince said the other day. \"learning there was so much more to basketball than playing basketball, than just playing the game.\" prince said it took her nearly five years, starting with her matriculation at rutgers, to learn, for example, that she had to take care of her body \"that i needed to eat better and work out more and get my body into a pro body.\" when she looked back at her high-scoring days at murry bergtraum, prince made an astonishing discovery. \"i was fat,\" she said. \"i have the pictures. i was scoring points, so nobody would tell me i was fat.\" finally at rutgers, prince was told by coach c. vivian stringer that she had to get herself in better shape and monitor what she put in her body. but it wasn't until she arrived in russia that prince began to put fitness first to get a pro body. laimbeer wants the lighter, leaner, 5-foot-9, 155-pound prince to score in bushels. this will be a necessity if the liberty hope to make noise and elicit more than shrugs from potential fans. \"i don't care if she goes 10 for 25 in a game,\" laimbeer said. \"we need that 10. that will eventually come out of her. i hope.\" maybe it will come in time for the liberty to make a run for the title, maybe not. \"we have to win,\" said laimbeer, who won three w.n.b.a. titles as the detroit shock's coach. \"but we started something with this franchise. we started the path.\" prince, who broke a high school scoring record nearly a decade ago, can be the unlikely trailblazer on that path for a team and a league.",

        "title": "leaders deny report of a truce in mideast violence.",
        "abstract": "jerusalem islamic jihad, the militant group responsible for firing dozens of rockets into israel from the gaza strip, announced thursday that egypt had intervened to restore calm, offering what at first looked like a familiar resolution to an escalation of violence that had shaken both sides of the border. but hamas, the militant palestinian faction that has ruled gaza since 2007, said it knew of no such truce, a sign of just how much has changed in recent times in the coastal enclave. throughout the evening, about a dozen more rockets were launched by smaller cells in gaza, showing how those changes could affect events on the ground. israel responded around midnight by bombing seven more gaza sites, the military said. a weakened hamas has struggled to maintain control since egypt's military ousted that nation's islamist leaders last summer. since then, gaza and its 1.7 million residents have become increasingly isolated and desperate as egypt shut down hundreds of smuggling tunnels, frequently closed its border crossings and declared hamas a terror organization. unemployment is at 39 percent, fuel shortages have led to half-day blackouts, prices for staples are soaring, and travel is thwarted. hamas has faced mounting challenges from its political rival, fatah, the iranian-backed islamic jihad, and a host of less organized radical groups. the upset to the status quo, experts said, may force israel to rethink its longstanding deterrence strategy, known as cutting the grass, occasional incursions carefully calculated not to create too much chaos. \"it's quite clear for israel that the balance of power in gaza is changing, and not to a very optimistic direction,\" said shaul shay, director of research at the institute of policy and strategy at the interdisciplinary center in herzliya. \"israel and hamas both have no interest in escalation, but there are other parties that are playing in the gaza strip, other bad guys.\" tony blair, the middle east peace envoy, said the rocket strikes \"underline and illustrate the depth of the problem.\" \"one thing we are going to need, medium- and long-term,\" he told reporters in jerusalem on thursday, \"is a completely new strategy toward gaza.\" after an hourlong barrage of more than 60 islamic jihad rockets wednesday afternoon, which had followed israeli strikes in gaza, israel on wednesday night bombed what it called 29 \"terror sites\" across gaza. it was by far the most intense exchange since the cease-fire that ended eight days of violence in november 2012. but the only reported injury was to an israeli woman who fell while running for cover. hostilities continued thursday: israeli airstrikes hit nine targets near the southern border town of rafah, injuring three, after two rockets from gaza hit open areas in the israeli cities of ashkelon and ashdod, sending panicked parents to pick up children early from schools. image israeli soldiers stood by the iron dome, israel's rocket interceptor system, near the southern city of ashkelon on thursday. credit david buimovitch/agence france-presse getty images \"our policy in the south is clear: we will strike at anyone who tries to attack us, and will respond forcefully to any attack,\" prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel declared at a thursday morning appearance here. \"it would be worthwhile for terrorists in the gaza strip to start internalizing the fact that they have an issue here with a very determined government and a very strong military.\" then, around 3 p.m., islamic jihad announced an egyptian-brokered truce on facebook. \"it's the same 2012 agreement, but today it was emphasized,\" nafez azzam, one of the group's leaders, explained in an interview. \"we are committed to the cease-fire as long as israel is.\" but israeli and hamas officials denied the cease-fire, and there was no report of it on egyptian state news media. over the next seven hours, the israeli military reported 10 more rockets fired from gaza. the palestinian popular resistance committees claimed responsibility for eight of them, and fatah's al aqsa martyrs brigade claimed responsibility for two. no injuries were reported in israel, but one rocket fell on a house in the northern gaza town of beit hanoun, wounding a woman and two children. \"this put hamas in an embarrassing situation,\" said akram attalah, a gaza-based political analyst. \"hamas has always wanted to be the first force when it comes to fighting against israel. now, the iranian money and military aid go to islamic jihad, not for hamas. islamic jihad is making progress and growing, while hamas doesn't appear as a resistance group.\" with president mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority scheduled to visit the white house on monday, palestinian leaders accused israel of purposely escalating the violence this week in hopes it would make washington pressure mr. abbas to extend the peace talks that started last summer. some israelis, however, argued that the gaza factions might be using the rockets to derail the talks. in gaza on thursday, many residents seemed more worried about an electricity crisis caused by israel's closing of its commercial crossing than about airstrikes. there was a sense of solidarity and pride on the streets. ahmed yousef, a gaza-based analyst close to the hamas leadership, said that hamas had tried to maintain calm through a council of gaza-based militant groups, but that egypt's economic stranglehold on the strip, coupled with this week's israeli killings, stirred things up. \"the people are so angry, so upset, so frustrated we are not going to die gradually by sanction and restriction,\" mr. yousef said. \"we are squeezed to the corner.\" giora eiland, a fellow at israel's institute for national security studies, said that after years of battling hamas, israel now finds itself in the strange situation of needing to shore it up as the best of bad options. \"the israeli interest should be that hamas is strong enough and stable enough and can maintain its power and can enforce law and order in gaza,\" said mr. eiland, a former national security adviser and retired army general. \"at the end of the day, hamas is the only organization that has some kind of government accountability, and the more accountability they have, the more careful they will be.\"",

        "abstract": "philadelphia when rowers descend here next weekend for the thomas eakins head of the schuylkill regatta , they'll be racing in a riverscape brought to life in eakins's celebrated rowing paintings. eakins took great pride in his city, the backdrop for most of his life and work. in a letter from paris in 1866, shortly after he arrived to study, he wrote that he felt \"6 feet and 6 inches high\" whenever he told frenchmen about philadelphia. he added: \"many young men after living here a short time do not like america. i am sure they have not known as i have the many reasonable enjoyments to be had there, the skating, the boating on our river, the beautiful walks in every direction.\" eakins made his rowing pictures in philadelphia between 1871 and 1874, and although he produced fewer than a dozen oils and watercolors on the theme, they are among his most popular paintings. \"the pair-oared shell,\" at the philadelphia museum of art, is the only one in this city. i've returned to see it dozens of times since my childhood, and it comes to mind whenever i'm paddling or rowing on any river, lake or ocean. the painting's magnetic pull comes from its tangibly realistic rendering of two rowers in their shell passing under a bridge, bathed in early evening light. what drew eakins to this scene and to rowing pictures? for some answers, i hit the eakins trail, choosing a sea kayak to navigate a stretch of river known even today for its world-class rowers. (this year alone, the city is host to 44 regattas.) it's also possible to explore on foot and bicycle via the schuylkill river trail. the logical starting place to take a stroke in eakins's waters is boathouse row, in fairmount park, the nerve center of rowing. it's where eakins, an amateur rower, would have put in. (his family's home, with a fourth-floor studio where he did most of his painting, is on mount vernon street, within walking distance; it's now home to the city's mural arts program, but the friendly staff has been known to give informal tours.) i wanted to follow suit. lloyd hall, at 1 boathouse row, is advertised as \" philadelphia's only public boathouse .\" but when i ambled up to the river's edge one recent afternoon, i found a dock with no gangplank; although some public-school groups and rowing classes put in at lloyd hall, it's not the city's recommended access point for solo boaters. image a pier from an earlier version of the columbia bridge casts a shadow in thomas eakins's painting \"the pair-oared shell.\" credit the philadelphia museum of art thwarted, i headed to the nearby undine barge club. frank furness was a principal architect of this boathouse, as he was for the pennsylvania academy of fine arts, where eakins taught and served as director. outside, a young man was loading his 26-foot racing shell on top of his car as rush-hour traffic whizzed by. he was charlie biddle, 27, training for the united states national team, and after i shared my problem about where to put in except for lloyd hall, the dozen or so boathouses on the row are private he invited me to kayak from the club on another day. philadelphia, after all, is the city of brotherly love. eakins's interest in painting rowing scenes may have emerged from his studies in paris with jean-leon gerome, who painted oarsmen rowing on the nile . the sport was also new in america, presenting a fresh subject for an artist eager to make his mark. \"he loved the subject of rowing,\" said kathleen foster, senior curator of american art at the philadelphia museum. she added that eakins also loved how rowing provided \"beautiful bodies in the outdoors, and a huge opportunity for figure painting.\" to figure out how to render the long, slender racing shells in space, eakins made the most detailed perspective drawings of his career. \"a boat is the hardest thing i know of to put into perspective,\" eakins told his art students. \"it is so much like the human figure. there is something alive about it.\" two large preparatory drawings for \"the pair-oared shell\" (which can be viewed by appointment in the museum's prints and drawings room) reveal how eakins approached the shell not just the rowers as a portrait. one drawing positions the shell and oars on a checkerboard grid in relation to a pier from the schuylkill's columbia bridge. there's even a shadow line on the bow of the boat that one scholar used to calculate the position of the sun and the time of day (around 7:20 p.m., in the early summer). the other drawing adds two rowers and watercolor in a mesmerizing study of how to render reflections in the ripples on the water. image another view of the columbia bridge. credit joyce dopkeen for the new york times on the appointed day, i launched from undine's dock into the brown waters of the schuylkill (pronounced school-kul). mr. biddle was in his racing shell, and i was taking my first strokes in the focus, a new wilderness systems sea kayak designed for fitness paddling that the maker had sent me to test out. my mission was to paddle around three nearby bridges whose precursors featured prominently in eakins's work. (the locations are the same, the bridges have been updated.) i immediately noticed how the kayak cuts through the water, moving more effortlessly than other, more traditional sea kayaks that i've paddled recently. the focus is a 15-foot plastic boat with ample hatch storage space for an overnight weekend trip that weighs 50 pounds and is meant to be easy to carry, to load on a car and to store. the thigh and hip braces made for a snug fit in the cockpit, which gave me a boost and helped make my paddling strokes more efficient. the rudder was also handy for keeping me on course when the wind or current picked up, or when i was trying to chase mr. biddle, who typically rows up to 22 miles a day in a sleek white italian racing shell with a blue stripe. he introduced me to the rules of the river road that have been around since eakins's day. head upstream on the west side and downstream on the east. this is especially important, since rowers face backward and kayakers forward: you want to avoid a jousting match with a high school shell powered by eight rowers and a coxswain. our first stop was the girard avenue bridge and the adjacent connecting railroad bridge. the river scene (looking south, downstream) served as the backdrop for eakins's first finished work in the series: \" the champion single sculls .\" it's a portrait of eakins's high school friend max schmitt, who had won a single-scull competition in october 1870, and it includes a self-portrait of eakins rowing. the painting is on view at the metropolitan museum of art. as an amtrak train heading south from new york rumbled over the stone masonry arch bridge, i paused to watch a merganser dive into the dark waters. continuing upstream, rounding a sharp bend in the river, i saw the columbia bridge looming, hawks circling above. this setting (the current bridge was built in the 1920s) captured eakins's eye; one pier of the previous bridge figures prominently in \"the pair-oared shell.\" eakins's friends the brothers john and barney biglin were the professional rowers in that painting, and mr. biddle offered the best explanation for their focused posture as he talked about racing. \"you're really kind of oriented to your task,\" he said. \"you have to pay attention to all these things you can't see.\" image credit the new york times in the midafternoon, i had the bridge practically to myself, and i couldn't help paddling figure eights through the piers and their reflections and shadows. before heading back downstream, i looked through the bridge and across to the west bank, where a green swath of trees dominates the view just as it does in the painting. at that moment, i recalled what elizabeth milroy, an expert on fairmount park at the philadelphia museum, told me: \"once you're on the river, there's no city.\" i floated in the waters, watching various rowers pass momentarily through the darkness into sparkling light. eakins captured moments like these in his paintings: the light, the water, the shell, the rowers and the park. it's all still here in philadelphia. you can find it on the river. how to roll on the river philadelphia museum of art 2600 benjamin franklin parkway; <phone>, philamuseum.org . pennsylvania academy of fine arts 118 and 128 north broad street; <phone>, pafa.org . the academy and the philadelphia museum together have the largest holdings of eakins work in this country. thomas eakins home 1729 mount vernon street; <phone>, muralarts.org . boathouse row the schuylkill navy posts information on all regattas in philadelphia, as well as safety information and rules; boathouserow.org . public docks there is supposed to be a public gangway at lloyd hall on boathouse row, but the parks department recommends the dock just south of columbia bridge on martin luther king jr. drive for weekdays, and the dock south of strawberry mansion bridge on kelly drive for weekends; phila.gov/parksandrecreation . boats wilderness systems' focus, the kayak i tested, retails for $1,639; wildernesssytems.com . there are no boat rentals on this section of the river. eastern mountain sports, at 525 west lancaster avenue, in haverford, is the closest outfitter for kayaks ($50 a day includes boat, life jackets, paddle and roof ties with foam blocks); <phone>. maps and conditions schuylkillriver.org ; phillyrivercast.org . more information budget at least one and a half hours for the three-mile round-trip paddle from columbia bridge to boathouse row. stay close to the east bank when approaching the row, as there is a low-head dam just downstream, an extreme hazard. for a longer, seven-mile round-trip excursion to see other bridges that eakins studied, head north from columbia bridge to manayunk. tie up at the manayunk brewing company's dock, about a mile north of the philadelphia canoe club, at the confluence of wissahickon creek and the schuylkill, for a lunch break. manayunk brewing company, 4120 main street; <phone>. joshua brockman",

        "title": "takeover of kenmore hotel: informer recalls his complicity.",
        "abstract": "it was as if the fifth infantry division had come marching down east 23rd street. late in the morning of june 8, 1994, police officers, federal marshals and f.b.i. agents invaded one of new york city's grand temples of dysfunction: the 22-story, 641-room ulcer known as the kenmore hotel. they ran into the lobby, which stank of mildew and urine. they ran up the stairs, as crack vials crackled beneath their feet. they battered down doors and rousted residents in that vast rabbit warren. they arrested 18 tenants on charges of drug dealing; the tenants sat, dazed, in handcuffs on the sidewalk. the takeover of the kenmore was at the time the largest federal forfeiture to fight drug dealing in american history. \"the kenmore hotel has been permeated by violence and become a virtual supermarket of crack cocaine,\" mary jo white, then the united states attorney in manhattan, told reporters. gov. mario m. cuomo visited the scene and mayor rudolph w. giuliani held an all-points press conference. why not? it was liberation. there is another, more unsettling version. two police informers now claim that the conquest of the kenmore was a dirty victory, another chapter in an era in which the police and prosecutors fought a blood tide of homicides, crack and heroin, and too often took disturbing liberties. we love to congratulate ourselves on new york's global reputation as a safe, even pasteurized metropolis. the informer's tale suggests that the trail the city traveled had more disquieting byways than we realized. a confidential informer, a man whose career in snitching for the police and federal agencies extends back to the watergate era, said the assault on the kenmore was constructed of illegalities. this informer, earl robert merritt, described how he had worked with narcotics officers before and after the takeover to frame more than 150 kenmore residents as dealers. \"i planted drugs, i planted guns, i made false reports,\" mr. merritt said. \"i was given a list little stars by the list of tenants who i was supposed to set up.\" \"i helped send hundreds of people out in handcuffs,\" he added, \"and i'd say 80 percent were innocent.\" mr. merritt, 70, who hobbles about with wrecked hips and two black canes, was an informer for nearly 40 years, according to federal and police records. the manhattan district attorney confirmed that he had worked at the kenmore; two officers said he was an excellent informer. he named dozens of people he said he had set up. some served prison terms, records show. after the takeover of the kenmore, he said, he undermined its tenants' association, again at the direction of federal agents. mr. merritt took his accusations to the manhattan district attorney last year. he said an assistant prosecutor in the mid-1990s had directed him to swear falsely that he had witnessed certain crimes. a public-corruption prosecutor interviewed mr. merritt and pulled court files. \"senior prosecutors have done extensive interviews with this informant, and followed several potential leads, but to date have not found provable allegations,\" a law enforcement official familiar with mr. merritt's allegations said. \"but the file is open, and if more information comes to light it will certainly be taken seriously.\" the district attorney's investigation appears to have been confined to pulling court files. in eight months of interviewing dozens of people connected with the kenmore, including former tenants, those arrested and police officers, i did not find one who had been questioned anew. mr. merritt's charges can be difficult to verify. many former kenmore tenants impoverished, haunted by addictions and bouncing along the river bottom of life have disappeared from the public record. by his own account, those whom mr. merritt fingered as drug dealers and illegally set up ran the gamut, from actual dealers to low-level drug users with mental health issues to tenant leaders who angered him or federal and city agents but were not dealing drugs at all. five people two former tenants, a caseworker, a former lawyer and another police informer confirmed mr. merritt's core accusations. three of the five spoke on the record. \"he'd tell us a tenant was going to be arrested and the next day, out they went, out in handcuffs,\" the former caseworker said. \"they wanted to clean the place out, and they gave him lists, and he'd be swearing to god people were drug dealers.\" image the hotel, a warren of 641 rooms on east 23rd street in manhattan, was notorious for drug dealing. credit john sotomayor/the new york times i reached dominick crispino, the former lawyer and tenant who has since been disbarred and done time for larceny. \"we kept saying merritt was a tool of the government and told the courts he was setting people up,\" he said. \"if he's coming clean, you can count on every word. he was one of the smartest people i ever tangled with.\" a quick-witted fellow with owlish eyes, mr. merritt lived in an ethical netherworld. he was a crack addict, and in the 1980s had been convicted of felony fraud and became a fugitive. (a judge later tossed out the conviction.) in long interviews at his apartment off fordham road in the bronx, however, mr. merritt rarely contradicted himself. court records confirmed his mastery of details. he insisted that i portray him as deeply flawed. \"you cannot paint me with a halo on my head,\" he said. \"i'm a nasty son of a bitch.\" three law enforcement agents described mr. merritt as a cunning informer. if there was a hero at the kenmore hotel, it was scott kimmins, a tall patrolman known to lawbreakers as stretch. before the federal takeover, he walked the hotel stairs alone. he rousted and arrested dealers and comforted marooned innocents. he came to know mr. merritt, who accused him of no illegalities. \"he was on the money, for the most part,\" noted mr. kimmins, now operations director for the flatiron 23rd street business improvement district. \"he'd mention a room, and sure enough, you'd see drug activity.\" mr. kimmins emphasized that he did not know the narcotics officers or their relationship with mr. merritt. he saw no need for illegal subterfuges. \"that's ridiculous,\" he said. \"you could be deaf and dumb and make a bust there.\" he said mr. merritt loved to tell tall tales of his supposed connections to intelligence agencies and watergate. but as it happened, those tales were true. federal records confirm that mr. merritt worked with the washington police and the f.b.i. to infiltrate left-wing groups in washington in the early 1970s; that his police handler apprehended the watergate burglars; and that he was interviewed by investigators for the watergate special prosecutor, archibald cox. told of this, mr. kimmins chuckled ruefully. years ago, he noted, he assumed the charges against the police officers accused of abusing abner louima were absurd. those accusations, too, proved true. \"i don't believe tony,\" he said. \"but i've been surprised before.\" mr. merritt offers his own caution: \"a confidential informant is a very powerful character. we don't need a badge or gun. and we ruin lives.\" the kenmore hotel had a seedy literary pedigree. it was a gramercy park refuge for dashiell hammett; nathanael west worked as a night manager. its decline was baroque. in 1985, tran dinh truong, a shipping magnate who prospered mysteriously during the vietnam war, arrived in the united states with suitcases full of gold bars. he bought the kenmore as a tax shelter, and ran it with no regard for safety. he filled the place with ex-convicts, prostitutes and addicts. he hired security guards who waved in anyone for a few dollars. mr. merritt, a moth to that flame, got a job. \"my main job was to hand out cash envelopes to the building and elevator inspectors,\" mr. merritt said. \"the only thing they inspected was their envelopes.\" conditions inside grew hideous. an 86-year-old was murdered in the communal bathroom. a woman was strangled in her room. for residents of gramercy park, an embattled middle-class pocket, the hotel visited miseries from burglaries to drug dealing. by the early 1990s, federal officials had set their eyes on mr. truong and his wayward hotel. narcotics officers and federal agents made more than 100 arrests and, records show, they relied on an informer: mr. merritt. image mayor rudolph w. giuliani in 1996 unveiling plans for the restoration of the kenmore hotel two years after it was taken over. credit don hogan charles/the new york times he is gifted at ingratiating himself. he could laugh with a dealer, buy vials of crack and smoke it. then he would point out that man for the police. \"if i didn't like you, or the police wanted you gone, you were gone,\" he said. it was as if he was inhaling chutzpah. \"it was too outrageous for even dealers to think he'd come right back the next day,\" the former caseworker said. robert chaney also worked there as a confidential informer. as pressure increased, narcotics officers plotted. \"they would get really upset when they busted into a room and found nothing there,\" he said. \"they gave him drugs and maybe a gun and he'd plant it.\" asked about this, mr. merritt nodded. \"they would tell me which rooms to target, and i would slip crack behind a mattress or under the sink.\" detectives taught him to set small fires, he said. firefighters would batter down doors; the police would find crack and guns. he got $50 per arrest, and $100 every time he testified to a judge. prosecutors guaranteed mr. merritt that he would not have to testify in public. they had suspects over a barrel: serve six months in jail and leave the hotel or we'll imprison you for 20 years. seen from the remove of a safer city, those dark years now reveal signs of a dirty war. too often, swaggering detectives and prosecutors eager for any victory broke rules and framed people. and confidential informers were given enormous latitude to set up people. eugene o'donnell, a professor at john jay college of criminal justice, was a beat officer before he became a prosecutor. the occupational hazard in dealing with informers, he said, was that \"your ears are open to what you want to hear.\" it was perilously easy, mr. o'donnell said, for an officer working with an informer to think nothing of setting up a hapless character with minor convictions. \"it dovetails with the problem of false convictions,\" he said. \"the real danger is that we get your rap sheet, and we see a track record of minor drug abuse, and no one loses sleep over your conviction. the ends justify the means.\" mr. merritt described being driven to the manhattan district attorney's office on a rainy evening. a prosecutor was typing statements for him, which he was going to swear to before a judge. \"read this carefully and don't stray from the statement,\" the prosecutor told him, he said. \"you're going to have to swear to this. do you have a problem, tony?\" he said he looked at the prosecutor and asked: \"so you want me to commit perjury?\" \"i don't want to hear that,\" the prosecutor replied, according to mr. merritt. after the takeover, mr. merritt said, federal marshals and the police told him to disrupt the tenants' association. he and mr. chaney tore down notices and interrupted meetings and shrieked. an officer, he said, told him to vandalize mr. crispino's car. \"he was very skilled and very scary; he could get you arrested in about five minutes,\" said sal martinez, a tenant leader. \"i complained and a federal agent yelled at me: 'merritt is working for us. don't get in our way.' \" there is no doubt the kenmore is a safer, better-run place. social services are provided; security is insistent. maybe we'll never know if more than 100 new yorkers got walked out in cuffs and convicted on the basis of planted evidence and false testimony. or perhaps the ends justified the means, and it's a door better left closed. except that similar raids occurred at other single-room-occupancy hotels throughout the city. mr. merritt worked as a confidential informer at a couple of those, too. this story, you see, may not end on east 23rd street. \"this is not just a kenmore story,\" mr. merritt said. \"this was happening everywhere.\"",

        "abstract": "islamabad, pakistan the pakistani government announced the creation of a new islamic appeals court over the weekend, saying that it was meeting the terms of a february peace agreement with the taliban and that the militants should now cease their armed struggle. but the taliban said sunday that they had not agreed to the two judges appointed to the provincial court. \"the government has fulfilled its part of the agreement,\" mian iftikhar hussain, the information minister for north-west frontier province, told reporters on saturday evening. \"now anyone carrying arms would be treated as a rebel and would be prosecuted in the qazi courts,\" he said. a qazi is a judge trained in islamic law. the peace deal has been strongly criticized in pakistan and abroad, in particular since militants, rather than disarming, have expanded their presence into neighboring areas in recent weeks. the pakistani army mounted an operation against them last week in the districts of dir and buner. under the february accord, the government of north-west frontier province agreed to impose shariah law in the malakand region, which covers the swat valley, where the taliban have de facto rule, and surrounding districts. in return, the militants agreed to disperse and disarm and hand over their heavy weapons. the agreement achieved a cease-fire in the swat valley but little else. around the main town of mingora, the taliban remain armed and in control. the military has ceased operations but has maintained its bases and gun positions all along the east side of the valley, said anees jillani, a lawyer who works at the supreme court and who visited the swat valley two weeks ago. the taliban continue to demolish schools in the valley because the military has often used them as bases during operations. meanwhile, fighting has shifted to the adjoining districts of dir and buner, which are also covered by the agreement, after taliban incursions there. a spokesman for maulana sufi muhammad, who is the pro-taliban negotiator, said sunday that the taliban had not agreed to the judges appointed to the new court, but that they would talk further with the government about it. a spokesman for the militants in swat, muslim khan, said the taliban had beheaded two government officials who were abducted saturday in revenge for the killing of two taliban commanders in buner, reuters reported. he was also reported by the local news media to have said the militants would not disarm, since weapons were the \"ornaments of islam.\" the provincial government, which is led by the awami national party, a secular pashtun party with a strong local following, has persisted with negotiations with the militants to implement the agreement in the interests of peace. party leaders have insisted that they have to win the people to their side, and that the only way to do that is to show that they are prepared to go the extra mile for peace and that military force, which has caused high civilian casualties, has been used only as a last resort. the pakistani military also backs the peace deal, and has been reluctant to fight the militants without strong political and public backing. each side has complained that the other has not kept to the deal. the militants and their supporters contend that the government has been slow to organize the islamic courts. the government says maulana muhammad has repeatedly changed the militants' demands. the provincial government created the islamic appeals court after maulana muhammad refused to recognize pakistan's higher courts of appeal. meanwhile, the military announced progress in its operations against militants in the district of buner. the operational commander, brig. fayyez mehmood, told local journalists that 80 militants had been killed in the weeklong operation. three pakistani servicemen had been killed and six wounded, he said. pakistani forces have secured the roads into the district from the west and the south and were now moving on the last base of militants in the north part of the district around asambar and the shrine of pir baba, he said.",

        "title": "merck to buy schering-plough for $41 billion.",
        "abstract": "a drug deal that is mainly about the drugs. that was many analysts' assessment monday of merck 's agreement to pay $41.1 billion in cash and stock for schering-plough . the merger would join pharmaceutical companies that had combined sales of $46.9 billion last year. mega-mergers of this sort have been widely expected ever since pfizer began the consolidation race in january by agreeing to pay $68 billion for wyeth . and others are likely to follow, as many of the same factors like expiring patents and soaring development costs propel drug makers into one another's arms. but if pfizer-wyeth was driven in part by desperation, analysts said, for merck the schering deal may actually be a good opportunity to restock its medicine chest. merck's former blockbuster bone drug fosamax has gone generic, and in a few years the same thing will happen to its best-selling allergy and asthma drug singulair. the merger gives it access to successful brand-name schering products with much longer patents, like the prescription allergy spray nasonex. and merck could capitalize on schering's investments in promising biotechnology drugs. \"it's better than the other deal,\" robert hazlett, an analyst with bmo capital markets, said of the merck-schering merger. \"i'm not enamored of pfizer-wyeth.\" among other measures, he said that pfizer had said it would slash its second-quarter dividend in half to 16 cents when it agreed to buy wyeth, while on monday merck told shareholders it would not change its 38-cent quarterly dividend. still, like any marriage of convenience, this one has potential dissenters who are unlikely to forever hold their peace. one likely controversy involves the cholesterol drugs zetia and vytorin, which the companies already jointly market and which last year had combined sales of $4.6 billion. but sales have been plummeting in the wake of studies that raised questions about vytorin's effectiveness and safety. on monday, senator charles e. schumer , democrat of new york, criticized the companies over vytorin and raised concerns about their planned merger. \"the last time these two companies teamed up, it was to aggressively market a brand-name drug that may not have provided any additional benefits over existing generics,\" he said in an e-mail statement. \"that incident left a sour taste in the mouths of a lot of people, and may have cost the government a lot of money.\" the house committee on energy and commerce has also been investigating the safety and efficacy of vytorin. merck executives said monday they were confident that a broader, longer-term vytorin study, set to conclude in 2012, would prove the drug to be safe and effective for lowering bad cholesterol. schering would also provide merck with popular consumer brands like coppertone and dr. scholl's, as well as a strong international presence 70 percent of schering revenue comes from outside the united states that would extend merck's global reach. and much more than merck, schering has been investing in developing biologics biotechnology drugs derived from living cells, which are much harder for potential generic makers to copy than the small-molecule chemical compounds on which the big pharmaceutical companies have traditionally based their businesses. in 2007, schering paid $14.4 billion for organon, a biotechnology company that has several novel drugs, including a fertility treatment, under late development. fred hassan , the chief executive of schering-plough, described the new company as a juggernaut of drug innovation and development that would have 18 drugs in phase 3 clinical trials the late-stage human studies that are required before new drugs can gain approval from the food and drug administration . \"eighteen phase 3 projects will make this the most effective and strongest r.& d. machine in the industry,\" mr. hassan said. by 2011, the merger should generate $3.5 billion in annual cost savings by consolidating research, manufacturing, administration and marketing, merck's chief executive, richard t. clark, said in a conference call with analysts. the new company could reduce the current work force of more than 100,000 by up to 15 percent with the cuts coming mainly from staffing outside of the united states, mr. clark said. further details of the merger are to be made public later in the week, he said. there is at least one big question that hangs over the proposed merger: what happens with remicade , a rheumatoid arthritis drug that represented $2.1 billion in sales for schering last year. schering markets remicade outside the united states in an agreement with johnson & johnson , which sells the drug in this country. under a termination clause in that agreement, the rights to remicade and another drug under development could revert to johnson & johnson if control or ownership of schering changes. hoping to avoid a challenge from johnson & johnson over the change-in-control clause, merck devised an unusual strategy called a reverse-merger agreement. under it, schering's ownership will not change, at least on paper. instead, even though merck is putting up the money to buy schering, and mr. clark of merck would run the combined companies, merck would technically become a subsidiary of schering. in turn, schering would be renamed merck, bruce n. kuhlik, merck's general counsel, said in an interview monday. \"we are very confident in our belief that this will not be a change in control,\" mr. kuhlik said. any dispute from johnson & johnson would go to arbitration, he said. johnson & johnson declined to comment on the deal. mr. clark of merck said that even if the merged companies somehow lost rights to sell remicade, that would not diminish schering's allure as a partner. but jason napodano, an analyst with zacks investment research, disagreed. \"i think that is a lot of malarkey,\" he said. \"you don't take out around 20 percent of a company's revenue and their core international growth driver and say it is not worth anything.\" david s. moskowitz, an analyst with caris & company, said that the uncertainty over remicade puts schering shareholders at a disadvantage. one response, he said, would be for johnson & johnson to make a higher bid for schering. like some other analysts, he said that the $41.1 billion price tag for schering was too low. \"it's the right move, but we don't believe it's the right price,\" mr. moskowitz said. \"we valued the deal at $50 billion.\" the deal values schering at $23.61 a share, a premium of 34 percent over its closing price friday. for each share of schering, shareholders will receive 0.5767 shares in the new company plus $10.50 in cash. shares of schering rose 14.18 percent, to $20.13 monday. shares of merck were down 7.7 percent, to $20.99. the stock prices of all big drug companies have plummeted over the last decade, in light of increasing competition and drug price pressures from generics and the high cost of developing new drugs. but the drug giants remain relatively cash rich, and the terms of this deal indicate that, even in a tight corporate credit market, financing is available under certain circumstances. merck will use $9.8 billion of its own cash for the purchase plus $8.5 billion in short-term financing, mr. clark said in a conference call with investment analysts on monday. the companies expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval. mr. moskowitz of caris predicted that the merck-schering deal would not be the last big drug merger of 2009. he cited bristol-myers squibb , a company comparable in size to schering with an attractive product pipeline. \"we think bristol-myers is the next on the block,\" mr. moskowitz said.",

        "title": "chinese curb cyberattacks on u.s. interests, report finds.",
        "abstract": "washington nine months after president obama and president xi jinping of china agreed to a broad crackdown on cyberespionage aimed at curbing the theft of intellectual property, the first detailed study of chinese hacking has found a sharp drop-off in almost daily raids on silicon valley firms, military contractors and other commercial targets. but the study , conducted by the isight intelligence unit of fireeye, a company that manages large network breaches, also concluded that the drop-off began a year before mr. obama and mr. xi announced their accord in the white house rose garden. in a conclusion that is largely echoed by american intelligence officials, the study said the change is part of mr. xi's broad effort to bring the chinese military, which is considered one of the main sponsors of the attacks, further under his control. as a result, the same political forces that may be alleviating the theft of data from american companies are also responsible for mr. xi's stunningly swift crackdown on the chinese media, bloggers and others who could challenge the communist party. \"it's a mixed bag,\" said kevin mandia, the founder of mandiant, now part of fireeye, which first detailed the activities of a people's liberation army cyber-arm, called unit 61398, that had been responsible for some of the most highly publicized thefts of american technology. \"we still see semiconductor companies and aerospace firms attacked.\" but the daily barrage of attacks has diminished, which mr. mandia attributed to \"public pressure\" from, among others, the justice department's decision to indict five members of the p.l.a. unit about a year after its activities were exposed. today, unit 61398 appears to be largely out of business, its hackers dispersed to other military, private and intelligence units. many china scholars and legal experts remain skeptical that the chinese are deterred by american indictments, since the p.l.a. officers are unlikely to see the inside of an american courtroom. but john p. carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, said the report validated his strategy. \"the lesson is that when you figure out who has done this kind of theft, don't fear making it public,\" he said. \"this is a slow process, but we are beginning to make people realize that even in cyberspace, laws and norms are applicable.\" mr. obama and mr. xi drew up their agreement narrowly. it covers intellectual property theft chinese cybercriminals have stolen everything from designs for the f-35 fighter jet to the design of gas distribution networks but not ordinary espionage against government targets. so, for example, the administration has not publicly talked about penalizing china for the theft of personal data on roughly 22 million americans, whose security-clearance information was taken from the office of personnel management. in fact, the administration has never publicly blamed china for that theft, although the director of national intelligence, james r. clapper jr., did talk about china's role once, before he was told by the administration not to refer to any specific country. as recently as last week, senior administration officials were in beijing trying to flesh out the agreement between the two presidents. participants say that among the points of discussion was how to set up a hotline through which the two countries can alert each other to malicious software they have detected in global networks, with the expectation that chinese and american investigators would work to find its source. establishing such norms of behavior is far more likely to be effective than attempting to negotiate a treaty, according to outside experts who have been trying to devise the cyberequivalent of arms-control agreements. \"treaties are not verifiable in the cyberarena,\" said joseph nye, a harvard professor known for his studies of how nations use \"soft power,\" who in recent years has turned to the problem of regulating activity in cyberspace. \"the same code can be benign or a weapon depending on the user's intent,\" he said. for example, a six-digit code that unlocks a cellphone is a protection for the user and a potential weapon for a hacker. \"so instead of focusing on the weapons, you have to focus on targets,\" mr. nye said. \"you start by saying that you don't target something that has a clearly civilian use, like a power grid.\" mr. nye and michael chertoff, the secretary of homeland security during the bush administration, who now runs a private firm that is deeply involved in cybersecurity, were among the lead authors of a report to be published on tuesday by the global commission on internet governance that will describe those norms to the united nations and other groups. just how fundamentally the chinese are changing is a matter of debate. there is some evidence, american intelligence officials say, that while the people's liberation army is not stealing as much on behalf of chinese state-owned firms, much of the hacking activity has been shifted to the intelligence agencies, which can make the case that they are stealing national security secrets, not commercial information. often, the difference is blurry, especially when the target is, say, the design of a satellite or a ship. even after mr. obama and mr. xi announced their agreement last fall, american officials have said they have discovered malware in power grids, cellphone networks and other purely civilian targets. but it is unclear whether that malicious software is intended to collect information about users, shut the system down or both. the fireeye study concluded that as early as 2014, around the time of the indictment of the p.l.a.'s officers and hackers, the chinese government had already been modifying its approach to cyberoperations. the study of 72 chinese hacking groups showed a sharp drop-off in the volume of attacks. but as recently as march, fireeye saw efforts to obtain information on american military projects by stealing access credentials to a contractor, and there has been continual theft of personal information from health care providers. the chinese hacking groups have also focused on non-american targets, including russia, south korea and vietnam, and have sometimes aimed at targets related to the disputes over chinese claims in the south china sea. the report concludes that chinese attacks have decreased in volume, but increased in sophistication. the result is that chinese hackers are now acting more like russian hackers: they pick their targets more carefully, and cover their tracks. \"we see a threat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks,\" the report said.",

        "title": "georgia elects new president, but real power will rest with next premier.",
        "abstract": "tbilisi, georgia georgian voters chose a new president on sunday, but with billionaire prime minister bidzina ivanishvili planning to step down shortly in favor of an unnamed successor, it remained unclear who would hold the prime minister's post, now the most powerful political office in the country. in balloting to replace president mikheil saakashvili, who catapulted to fame as leader of the peaceful rose revolution in 2003, mr. ivanishvili's handpicked candidate, giorgi margvelashvili, a former deputy prime minister and education minister, was headed to a decisive victory, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls commissioned by the country's two main television stations. \"we have shown to the world that we can elect leadership in a free way,\" mr. margvelashvili told exuberant supporters waving blue and yellow flags at a victory celebration outside the headquarters of mr. ivanishvili's party georgia dream. calling mr. ivanishvili \"my friend forever,\" he said, \"i and the team who helped me win are ready to serve the people.\" the larger question focused on who mr. ivanishvili might name as his successor, given his plan to leave office after just one year and instead seek to influence the country's future as a private citizen, albeit one who commands a personal fortune of more than $5 billion equal to roughly one-third of the entire country's annual economic output. under constitutional changes that take effect with the inauguration of the new president, the prime minister, who is chosen by parliament, becomes the head of the government with full executive authority over domestic and foreign policy. the president remains head of state and commander in chief, but cannot introduce legislation or propose the state budget. mr. ivanishvili tapped his fortune to make a forceful entry into politics last year, creating georgian dream, an alliance of minor opposition parties, to compete in parliamentary elections with the main goal of dislodging mr. saakashvili. he pulled off an upset victory prompted partly by the disclosure of videos showing abuse of prison inmates. mr. saakashvili was widely acclaimed abroad as a leading champion of democracy in the ex-soviet union, winning numerous fans, including presidents bill clinton and george w. bush, with his gregarious personality. but he was increasingly unpopular at home, accused of allowing human rights violations by overly aggressive security services in a nation that the west has cultivated as a bulwark of democracy in the post-soviet space. the loss in the parliamentary elections by his party, united national movement, left mr. saakashvili to serve his final year in office in the awkward role of an opposition figure. still, his decision to accept the results and to respect a constitutional limit of two terms in office made for a peaceful, democratic transfer of power, a rarity in the ex-soviet union. united national movement's presidential candidate, the leader of its minority faction in parliament, david bakradze, finished second in sunday's balloting, according to the exit polls. he was followed by nino burjanadze, a former speaker of parliament. image surrounded by members of the news media, mr. margvelashvili embraced his daughter after voting at a tbilisi polling station. credit justyna mielnikiewicz for the new york times in interviews on sunday, many voters said that they were content to cast their vote for mr. margvelashvili, who they said appeared to be a well-intentioned public official without the outsized personality of mr. saakashvili or mr. ivanishvili. \"he is a normal person,\" said bondo pankvelashvili, 75, a retired driver, outside polling station 19 in the vera neighborhood of tbilisi, the capital. \"this is a problem with society. they are looking for a messiah and waiting for him to do something. until we have a strong civil society, nothing will change. this is what we got from soviet times.\" nana gamcemlidze, 51, an elementary school teacher who voted in the middle-class neighborhood of saburtalo, praised mr. margvelashvili as education minister for making schoolbooks free for children. \"he has a clean slate, has never played political games,\" ms. gamcemligze said. \"he does not have the attitude of someone who is power hungry.\" giorgi kipiani, 51, a small-business owner who came to vote pushing his 6-month-old grandson, also giorgi, in a stroller, said that he was comfortable with mr. ivanishvili stepping down. \"he doesn't give up that he is responsible,\" mr. kipiani said, adding that if one had as much money as mr. ivanishvili, \"would you really want to stay in the georgian government?\" election officials said that turnout was relatively low, 46.6 percent, compared with 61 percent in parliamentary balloting a year ago, but several voters praised the atmosphere of tranquillity. that was a marked departure from last year, when many predicted that the parliamentary elections would end with violent protests or even a civil war. merab koiava, 80, a retired geologist in a state agency, voted for mr. bakradze even as he lamented the way that mr. saakashvili's tenure had ended on sour notes. \"in the beginning he was so great.\" mr. koiava said. \"i have no idea why he started to make mistakes. maybe it was the people who were around him.\" like many georgians, mr. koiava said mr. saakaskhvili deserved credit for transforming a country that was largely in political and economic chaos. \"georgia started looking like a state,\" he said, \"and this town started looking like a capital.\" since losing power, numerous officials who served in mr. saakashvili's administration have been arrested and charged with crimes. critics of mr. ivanishvili say that the cases are nothing more than ruthless political retribution, while members of the current government say they are intended to hold former officials accountable for corruption and abuse of authority, and to answer demands by the public for justice. mr. ivanishvili in a speech to supporters on sunday said that the presidential election showed that georgia had joined \"european civilization.\" an announcement about his successor as prime minister is expected this week. speculation has focused on the minister of labor, health and social affairs, david sergeenko, and the minister of interior affairs, irakli garibashvili, a close ally of mr. ivanishvili's. maia goksadze-osmanagoglu, 33, who works for a cellphone company, said she voted for mr. bakradze because she wanted the president and prime minister to be members of different parties. \"i want them to be under constant scrutiny,\" she said, \"because we know when it is only about one opinion, it leads to bad consequences.\"",

        "abstract": "a proposal is under review that would make la guardia airport far more attractive to business travelers by adding domestic long-haul and coast-to-coast trips. so when i got off a short-haul flight at a teeming la guardia last week, i wondered what this might portend. \"less squalor at la guardia, one would hope,\" said david white, a technology consultant from britain who had just returned to new york from chicago and was waiting in a long taxi line, on an afternoon as gray and dismal as the terminal he had just left. mr. white seemed to have chosen the noun with some thought, since la guardia is often derided for its overcrowding, limited and dingy amenities, and all-around ... well, squalor. vice president joseph r. biden jr. recently put a rather fine point on all of this when he said that la guardia resembled an airport in \" some third world country. \" mayor bill de blasio understandably called the wisecrack \"inappropriate.\" so you could say that la guardia gets no respect but that would be overlooking its appeal as the new york-area airport that is most convenient to manhattan, and as such the airport of choice for many business travelers on domestic flights. \"passengers have a love-hate relationship with la guardia,\" said jason rabinowitz, the data research manager at routehappy, an air travel research company. \"we hate being at la guardia and waiting for a flight, but most new yorkers also love the fact that they can get to la guardia in a relatively short period of time.\" there are no weekday nonstop coast-to-coast flights at la guardia, but that would change under a proposal, first reported by the wall street journal, to drop a so-called perimeter rule that limits flights sundays through fridays at la guardia to a distance of 1,500 miles. the rule has a long history, starting in the 1950s with a 2,000-mile limit to encourage long-haul and international growth at idlewild (later kennedy), then a fledgling airport. in the 1980s, the limit was changed to 1,500 miles as a way to also manage mounting congestion. (there is one exemption for flights to and from denver, which is about 1,600 miles away.) all three major new york airports kennedy, newark and la guardia are operated by the port authority of new york and new jersey , which says it is studying the issue and will eventually schedule public discussions on the proposal. the port authority is also managing difficulties with a long-delayed project to replace the aging 1964 central terminal building at la guardia (known as terminal b) with a bigger, more appealing structure. that project is about six years from its estimated completion. \"we think there is going to be a robust debate\" over the perimeter rule, patrick j. foye, the executive director of the port authority, said after the agency's board meeting last week. those involved in the debate will certainly include the airlines that would stand to benefit from the possible change mainly american and delta, which already have about two-thirds of the available flight slots at la guardia and those like united and jetblue, which have strong transcontinental and long-haul domestic positions at kennedy, as well as newark. hotels and other travel businesses will also be heard from in the debate, as will business travel organizations and, of course, neighborhood groups concerned about potentially increased noise and congestion at la guardia. discussions about changing the perimeter rule will occur within a looming donnybrook over a separate but related issue: strict federal allocations of flight-schedule slots in airspace that is the most heavily congested in the country first put into effect in 2008 to address chronic delays at all three new york airports. current caps on flight slots expire on oct. 29, 2016, and the federal aviation administration says it hopes to then revise the way slots are bought and sold. over all, the port authority's job with the airports it runs is to \"operate them as a system,\" said kevin mitchell, the chairman of the business travel coalition, which represents corporate travel managers. any basic changes to la guardia operations would also require accommodating airlines and passengers at kennedy and newark, he pointed out. any change would also come against this background: all air-travel planning in the united states occurs today within the context of airlines' carefully designed, and manifestly profitable, strategies. for years, as i frequently point out here, airlines have steadily reduced service that uses smaller airplanes at midsize and small airports to focus more on feeding business travelers into far more profitable long-haul flying, including connections to international flights at major airports. opening la guardia to nonstop coast-to-coast and other long-haul domestic nonstop flights would mean reducing the current number of regional flights of 1,500 miles or less, many of them to smaller airports in the east and midwest, because airlines would use their limited number of gates and strictly limited flight slots for longer trips at higher yields per mile flown. \"la guardia is kind of unique in the new york area in that it serves a lot of smaller regional airports simply because of that 1,500-mile perimeter limit,\" mr. rabinowitz said. \"so if the perimeter rule were lifted, there would definitely be cuts in regional flights.\"",

        "abstract": "kabul, afghanistan taliban attacks in eastern afghanistan on monday killed 2 american soldiers and 17 afghans, including at least 11 children, adding to a particularly deadly season for civilians this year. early monday, a roadside bomb destroyed a small truck, killing a family of seven including two children on their way home from collecting firewood in mehtarlam, the capital of laghman province, officials said. a second attack, apparently aimed at american forces in a remote district of paktia province, killed two soldiers, an afghan policeman and at least nine children when a suicide attacker on a motorcycle set off his bomb near a boys' school. the deaths were immediately condemned by humanitarian organizations, the coalition forces and president hamid karzai. \"civilian massacre, particularly of our innocent children, is an unforgivable crime whose perpetrators will eventually pay the price and be held into account not only before the almighty but also before our proud and suffering nation,\" mr. karzai said in a statement. image a suicide bomber targeted american forces in a remote district of paktia province, killing two soldiers, an afghan policeman and at least nine children. credit ihsanullah majroh/associated press in this year's fighting season, afghan civilians always the hardest hit by war violence have borne an even heavier toll than usual. the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan said that in the past two weeks, conflict-related violence had killed 125 civilians and injured an additional 274, a 24 percent increase from the period a year before. insurgents were responsible for 84 percent of the deaths, the agency said. \"these attacks resulted in a high number of civilian casualties, with minimal impact on their purported military targets,\" jan kubis, the united nations secretary general's special representative and the head of unama, said in a statement. the taliban issued no statement about the attacks. although the coalition forces have in recent months mostly stopped reporting statistics about violence just a year before the nato combat mission in afghanistan is scheduled to end officials have become more diligent in pointing out civilian deaths inflicted by the taliban. in general, civilian fatalities caused by western forces, particularly in airstrikes, seem to cause more outrage in the public than insurgent-caused deaths even though the estimated toll from taliban violence has far outstripped other causes of death for afghan civilians throughout the war. but some analysts here believe that most afghans resent the presence of foreigners even more . \"one of the main reasons that despite heavy civilian casualties people support the taliban is the presence of the foreign forces in the country,\" said wahid mujdah, an analyst in kabul. \"people indeed blame the foreigners for everything that happens in afghanistan because they believe that if it was not for the foreigners the taliban would not have killed civilians.\"",

        "title": "finding scandal in new york and new jersey, but no shame.",
        "abstract": "from sea to shining sea, or at least from one side of the hudson to the other, politicians you have barely heard of are being accused of wrongdoing. there were so many court proceedings involving public officials on monday that it was hard to keep up. in newark, two underlings of gov. chris christie were arraigned on charges that they were in on the truly deranged plot to block traffic leading onto the george washington bridge. ten miles away, in lower manhattan, dean g. skelos, the leader of the new york state senate, and his son, adam b. skelos, were arrested by the federal bureau of investigation on accusations of far more conventional political larceny, involving a job with a sewer company for the son and commissions on title insurance and bond work. the younger man managed to receive a 150 percent pay increase from the sewer company even though, as he said on tape, he \"literally knew nothing about water or, you know, any of that stuff,\" according to a criminal complaint the united states attorney's office filed. image bill baroni, a former port authority official who was indicted in the george washington bridge scandal, said, \"i would never risk my career, my job, my reputation for something like this.\" credit richard perry/the new york times the success of adam skelos, 32, was attributed by prosecutors to his father's influence as the leader of the senate and as a potentate among state republicans . the indictment can also be read as one of those unfailingly sad tales of a father who cannot stop indulging a grown son. the senator himself is not alleged to have profited from the schemes, except by being relieved of the burden of underwriting adam. the bridge traffic caper is its own species of crazy; what distinguishes the charges against the two skeloses is the apparent absence of a survival instinct. it is one thing not to know anything about water or that stuff. more remarkable, if true, is the fact that the sewer machinations continued even after the former new york assembly speaker, sheldon silver, was charged in january with taking bribes disguised as fees. it was by then common gossip in political and news media circles that senator skelos, a republican, the counterpart in the senate to mr. silver, a democrat, in the assembly, could be next in line for the criminal dock. \"stay tuned,\" the united states attorney, preet bharara said, leaving not much to the imagination. even though the cat had been unmistakably belled, skelos father and son continued to talk about how to advance the interests of the sewer company, though the son did begin to use a burner cellphone, the kind people pay for in cash, with no traceable contracts. that was indeed prudent, as prosecutors had been wiretapping the cellphones of both men. but it would seem that the burner was of limited value, because by then the prosecutors had managed to secure the help of a business executive who agreed to record calls with the skeloses. it would further seem that the business executive was more attentive to the perils of pending investigations than the politician. through the end of the new york state budget negotiations in march, the hopes of the younger skelos rested on his father's ability to devise legislation that would benefit the sewer company. that did not pan out. but senator skelos did boast that he had haggled with gov. andrew m. cuomo, a democrat, in a successful effort to raise a $150 million allocation for long island to $550 million, for what the budget called \"transformative economic development projects.\" it included money for the kind of work done by the sewer company. image bridget anne kelly, the former deputy chief of staff to gov. chris christie. her lawyer said she would strongly rebut the charges. credit richard perry/the new york times the lawyer for adam skelos said he was not guilty and would win in court. senator skelos issued a ringing declaration that he was unequivocally innocent. this was also the approach taken in new jersey by bill baroni, a man of great presence and eloquence who stopped outside the federal courthouse to note that he had taken risks as a republican by bucking his party to support paid family leave, medical marijuana and marriage equality. \"i would never risk my career, my job, my reputation for something like this,\" mr. baroni said. \"i am an innocent man.\" the lawyer for his co-defendant, bridget anne kelly, the former deputy chief of staff to mr. christie, a republican, said that she would strongly rebut the charges. perhaps they had nothing to do with the lane closings. but neither mr. baroni nor ms. kelly addressed the question of why they did not return repeated calls from the mayor of fort lee, n.j., begging them to stop the traffic tie-ups, over three days. that silence was a low moment. but perhaps new york hit bottom faster. senator skelos, the prosecutors charged, arranged to meet long island politicians at the wake of wenjian liu, a new york city police officer shot dead in december, to press for payments to the company employing his son. sometimes it seems as though for some people, the only thing to be ashamed of is shame itself.",

        "title": "campaign spotlight: goodbye, gourmet; hello, food fanatics.",
        "abstract": "newsweek has decided to end its print edition, and other publications like gourmet, pc magazine, smartmoney and u.s. news & world report are now only in digital formats. so it is perhaps not surprising that a new print magazine is being brought out by a company that specializes in food service products rather than journalism. the magazine, a quarterly named food fanatics, is being introduced with a 64-page fall issue by us foods , formerly known as u.s. foodservice. us foods, which is owned by clayton, dubilier & rice and kohlberg kravis roberts & company, wants the magazine to serve as a marketing vehicle to help increase sales for its more than 350,000 products as well as to help burnish the us foods corporate brand image. food fanatics is a custom publication with a controlled circulation, to use publishing industry parlance, rather than a traditional magazine meant to be bought by the general public. the intended audience for the 120,000 copies of the debut issue is primarily restaurant owners and operators; us foods says its customers total more than 250,000. us foods, which competes with food service companies like sysco, hired a custom publishing company called imagination , based in chicago, to edit and publish food fanatics. us foods will spend several hundred thousand dollars each year to sponsor the magazine. still, food fanatics looks very much like a magazine that would be found on newsstands. the articles and photographs are far more evocative of a traditional magazine than an advertorial or infomercial. for example, the first issue includes articles about sustainable seafood, the popularity of doughnuts, meals that restaurants serve to their staff members and a look at places to eat in minneapolis. there are also recipes for dishes like filipino-style roasted chicken and arctic char with whole bean and artichoke giardiniera as well as a \"trend tracker\" and question-and-answer features with chefs. food fanatics also offers readers something they will find in many mainstream consumer magazines: cute headlines replete with puns and plays on words. for instance, the article about doughnuts is described as \"paying homage to our homeyness\" and the article on sustainable seafood, which is the cover article, has the headline \"get schooled.\" another way food fanatics resembles a traditional magazine is that it is has advertising from outside marketers as well as for us foods products like cross valley farms and rykoff sexton. the initial issue includes ad pages from brands like t-mobile, truvia and verizon. the ad revenue is meant to offset some of the costs for us foods in sponsoring the magazine. and food fanatics is just as abreast of the changes in the print media as more conventional magazines. it has a web site , is available as a pdf and will soon be available as an ipad app. the magazine also has a social media presence the way traditional magazines do, on facebook and twitter . us foods is coming out with food fanatics just over a year after the rebranding that changed its name from u.s. foodservice, says marshall warkentin, vice president for us foods in rosemont, ill. \"our goal is to be known as a great food company,\" he adds, and \"we've made a concerted effort to focus on innovative food ideas and ways to help our customers be more successful.\" for instance, us foods has teamed up with a butcher, pat lafrieda, to market meat products under the chef's line brand sold by us foods, mr. warkentin says. \"we introduced 75 products like that, that are exclusive and differentiated,\" he says. the goal then became to convey all that to customers and potential customers in a way that \"combines food celebrities, food ideas and food insights with the business side of food,\" mr. warkentin says. \"it's a gap that needed to be filled,\" he adds, \"and the magazine is a key catalyst in connecting.\" the best method to reach the intended audience is to focus on \"the ingredient that ties them all together,\" mr. warkentin says, no pun intended, which is \"a love and passion for food.\" \"if you're in the business, you have to have a passion for it,\" he adds, or in other words, be \"fanatical about food.\" in a twist on distribution, about 80 percent of the 120,000 copies of each issue of food fanatics will be hand-delivered to the target readers by the estimated 6,000 members of the us foods sales force, mr. warkentin says. \"i call it a supercharged u.s. postal service,\" he adds. (the remaining copies will be mailed and given away at industry events.) because the magazine will give the sales staff of us foods another reason to interact with current and potential customers, it makes sense to have a print edition, mr. warkentin says. \"we spent a lot of time talking about\" the challenges facing print publications, he adds, but the target audience \"told us print is still the primary way they keep up with\" what is going on in the industry. at the same time, \"if we were going to do a magazine that would be providing deeper insight in the business,\" mr. warkentin says, \"we did not want it to be perceived as a glorified advertisement for us foods, or a glorified brochure.\" enter imagination, a company that produces custom publications for marketers in fields like banking and health care. \"credibility\" is paramount, says laura yee, the content director for imagination. she has the same title at food fanatics, and says she wants the magazine to take \"a completely objective approach.\" for instance, some people interviewed for articles are customers of us foods, she adds, and some are not. us foods is \"leading the charge in selling the advertising\" to food industry marketers in addition to the ads it runs for its own brands, ms. yee says, while imagination is handling the ad sales for the categories outside the food service industry like telecommunications. \"when i had the opportunity to work on this magazine, i jumped on it,\" ms. yee says, because of her background as a former journalist, which includes 10 years of writing about food and serving as the food editor of the plain dealer in cleveland. ms. yee also had a public relations and marketing business, she says, with restaurants as clients. and to bring food even closer to home, \"my husband's a chef,\" she adds. if you like in advertising, be sure to read the advertising column that runs monday through friday in the business day section of the new york times print edition and on nytimes.com . and read coverage anytime of advertising, marketing, television, print, movies and new media on the media decoder blog at mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com .",

        "title": "a public slur in '38 revealed baseball's racism.",
        "abstract": "the national baseball hall of fame recently updated jackie robinson's plaque to reflect the courage and poise he showed in integrating baseball in 1947. no plaque or distinction will ever be accorded jake powell nor should they but his racist comment 70 years ago broke the conspiracy of silence that protected segregated baseball. during a pregame interview at comiskey park in chicago on july 29, 1938, the wgn radio announcer bob elson asked powell, a yankees outfielder, what he did during the off-season. powell replied that he was a policeman in dayton, ohio. when elson asked him how he stayed in shape, powell, using a common racial slur, replied that he cracked blacks over the head with his nightstick. hundreds of outraged listeners called the station. others called the chicago office of the baseball commissioner, kenesaw mountain landis. before the next day's game, a delegation of black leaders presented a petition to umpires demanding that powell be barred from baseball for life. although major league baseball had turned a deaf ear to criticism of its color line, it could neither dismiss nor deny the outcry over powell's slur. landis suspended him for 10 days. the sporting news reported that it was the first time that a major league ballplayer had been suspended for a racist remark. l'affaire jake powell, as it was called, revealed the hypocrisy of segregated baseball. landis punished a racist player, yet landis and the baseball establishment had long practiced racial discrimination against black players. this was not the story's only twist. in 1936, the washington senators traded powell to the yankees for the virulent racist ben chapman. powell never worked as a police officer in dayton or anywhere else, as he had contended, though, as it turned out, he died in a police station a decade later. the powell incident unified those who had begun calling for the end of segregated baseball, and it put the game's establishment on the defensive. it is doubtful whether landis, known derisively in the black press as the great white father because he blocked attempts to integrate baseball, would have suspended powell without outside pressure. alvin jacob powell was born in silver spring, md., on july 15, 1908. he was known as a hustler on and off the field. during a trip with the minor league dayton ducks, powell tried to leave his hotel room with a circular fan, the drapes and a bedspread. \"he probably would have taken the mattress if he could have got it in his suitcase,\" ducks manager howard e. holmes said at the time. powell and his wife made their home in dayton. he talked about joining the police department, and friends said his remark about blacks was his idea of a joke, according to the dayton daily news. in powell's first full season with the senators, in 1935, he hit .312 and had 98 runs batted in. but by the next year, the senators wanted to trade him. the unpopular powell deliberately collided with detroit first baseman hank greenberg, who was jewish, breaking greenberg's wrist and ending his 1936 season after 12 games. in addition, powell's creditors had threatened to sue the senators to settle his gambling debts. the yankees had also had enough of chapman, who taunted jewish spectators at yankee stadium with nazi salutes and anti-semitic epithets. powell hit .302 in 87 games with the yankees in 1936, then led the team in hitting and runs during the world series the first of four straight championships for the yankees. powell's playing time was reduced during the 1937 and 1938 seasons. to most white sportswriters, who were silent about the color line, powell's words were harmless and unintentional. the columnist dan daniel, the longtime president of the baseball writers' association of america, said powell could have been more careful, but \"he is a hustling player, aggressive, and always getting into a jam.\" black journalists, however, railed against powell and the baseball establishment. they urged their readers to boycott yankees games and the corporate sponsors of the team's radio broadcasts. the yankees, the most powerful team in baseball, were forced to apologize and ask what they could do to improve relations with the black community. black leaders kept up the pressure, demanding that the yankees trade or release powell. when powell returned to the field during a game at griffith stadium in washington, spectators threw bottles at him. the yankees kept powell for two more seasons but played him sparingly. he was released in 1941. powell spent time in the minor leagues before joining the senators, who then traded him to the philadelphia phillies in 1945, his final season in the majors. the phillies' manager was chapman, whose managerial career was best remembered for his vitriolic race-baiting of jackie robinson during robinson's rookie season with the brooklyn dodgers in 1947. shortly after powell's career in professional baseball ended in the minors in 1948, he was arrested for passing bad checks. while being questioned in a police station, powell shot himself to death. \"he died in washington, d.c.,\" powell's obituary in the dayton daily news read, \"not as a cop as he often dreamed of being, but as a man arrested on a bad-check charge, the last of a series of his madcap adventures.\"",

        "title": "olmert and omar: talking baseball.",
        "abstract": "some people go to israel and see their grandchildren. omar minaya went to israel last week and met with prime minister ehud olmert , president shimon peres, the former prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the famed russian refusenik natan sharansky, a former member of the israeli cabinet and parliament. but the most intriguing moment of minaya's trip came in a meeting he didn't attend. two days after minaya, the mets ' general manager, and other members of his traveling group met with olmert, president bush met with olmert. the trip was bush's first visit to israel as president. \"o says hello,\" olmert told bush, among other things more critical to middle east peace. minaya, known to co-workers in past years as o, explained by relating part of his conversation with olmert. \"he said if he wasn't the prime minister he wanted to be the owner of a soccer team,\" minaya said. \"i told him i was general manager of a baseball team. he said, 'that's a game i don't understand.' i said: 'come to america and come to a baseball game and be my guest. i'd love to explain it to you.' \" then minaya said he added: \"if you want anyone to explain baseball to you, the guy who can really explain it and who loves the game as much as i do is the president. he'll talk to you about baseball. i worked for him, and he really understands baseball. you can tell him that o told you that.\" minaya said olmert replied that he was going to tell bush, \"i'm going to tell him i spoke to you, and tell him you told me that.\" one more thing minaya said he told olmert: \"he doesn't call me omar. he calls me o. tell him you talked about baseball with o and he'll know what you're talking about.\" so olmert did precisely that, and bush, the former managing partner of the texas rangers, knew exactly whom olmert meant. arn tellem, a player agent who put together the travel group and the itinerary, said olmert called him the day after he met with bush. \"he said he mentioned the group to bush and told him one of his ex-employees, o, said hello,\" tellem said. \"oh, you mean omar?\" bush replied, olmert told tellem. his relationship with bush, however, carried no weight when they were in israel. minaya and his group had to vacate their hotel in jerusalem because bush and his contingent were coming. \"the original plan was we were going to be in jerusalem one more day,\" minaya said. \"but they kicked us out because the president was coming.\" last winter minaya was part of a group that made a good-will trip to ghana. in part, the trip was designed to promote baseball in ghana, where a baseball field is under construction. minaya was the lone baseball official on the trip to israel, an excursion tellem said he puts together periodically. \"every couple years,\" he said, \"i take a group of sports and business people to israel to gain a perspective and appreciation of israel and to learn about the country and the people and to have a greater understanding of the issues in the area.\" he said he also used sports to bring together israeli and palestinian children in an effort \"to change the attitude of the next generation,\" adding that he believed sports was \"an effective tool of bringing kids together.\" on this trip, the group attended a basketball clinic conducted by b. j. armstrong, a former n.b.a. player and a client of tellem's, in jerusalem, in which israeli and palestinian children from the west bank participated. in ghana, minaya visited a facility where slaves were once housed before they were taken to the new world. in israel, the group visited yad vashem holocaust museum. \"that's powerful stuff,\" minaya said. there were meetings with olmert and the other high-ranking officials, as well as the former chief of staff of the israeli defense forces, the former chief of the secret service, the mayor of jerusalem, the rabbi of the country's holy sites and the director of the palestinian human-rights monitor group. minaya's group, which also included steve greenberg, the former deputy baseball commissioner and tellem's former partner, also visited the western wall and toured the christian quarter in the old city of jerusalem. minaya also met with people who are involved with youth baseball. \"we have to find a way to help baseball there,\" he said. \"i've worked on building four or five baseball fields in the dominican republic. we have to do something in israel to bring baseball there and give the kids the opportunity to play baseball. i told arn we have to get it done.\" minaya did not ignore his day job while he was in israel. he had his cellphone with him and talked with other general managers daily. but just in case he forgot that he had a job to do, mets fans were there to remind him. \"i can happily report there were mets fans in israel,\" he said. \"people came up to me in the airport and said, 'go mets.' they also said, 'have a good year, but get more pitching.' \" minaya, however, did not bring a pitcher home with him.",

        "title": "state department cautions americans considering travel to iran.",
        "abstract": "kuala lumpur, malaysia the obama administration hopes that the nuclear deal it negotiated with iran may one day lead to broader cooperation. but the state department has some cautionary words for americans who think the reconciliation is already underway. \"this deal over iran's nuclear program does not alter the united states' assessment of the risks of travel to iran for u.s. citizens,\" says a travel warning the agency issued on wednesday. \"dual national iranian-american citizens may encounter difficulty in departing iran,\" it says. advisories for americans who travel abroad are regularly published by the state department. the latest entry on iran follows a warning in january, and it was made public the day president obama defended the nuclear accord in a major speech at american university in washington. while many united states citizens, including iranian-americans, travel to and from iran without problems, there have been some notable exceptions. iran is currently holding three americans of iranian descent : jason rezaian, a reporter for the washington post; amir hekmati, a marine veteran from flint, mich.; and saeed abedini, of boise, idaho, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for establishing a private network of churches. a fourth american, robert a. levinson, vanished there eight years ago. secretary of state john kerry, who traveled here for a regional meeting on security issues, and other senior united states officials urged iran to free the americans in discussions with their iranian counterparts on the margins of the nuclear talks. in a television appearance last month, mr. kerry said he was \"very hopeful\" that iran would \"do the right thing.\" as much as the administration hopes at least some of the americans will be released in the wake of the nuclear accord, the state department warning reflects concerns that iran could detain other visitors, particularly iranian-americans, on false charges or make it hard for them to leave. \"since 2009, iranian authorities have prevented the departure, in some cases for several months, of a number of iranian-american citizens, including journalists and academics, who traveled to iran for personal or professional reasons,\" the warning says, repeating language from the january notification. \"iranian authorities also have unjustly detained or imprisoned u.s. citizens on various charges, including espionage and posing a threat to national security.\" with no formal diplomatic relations, the united states relies on the swiss embassy in tehran to provide services to traveling americans. but there is a catch, the state department notes. \"the iranian government does not recognize dual citizenship and will not allow the swiss to provide protective services for u.s. citizens who are also iranian nationals,\" it says.",

        "title": "in two starts, tanaka has made it look easy.",
        "abstract": "tampa, fla. it is only two starts, and it is only spring training, but like a developing piece of film, a clearer image of masahiro tanaka is emerging, and it continues to dazzle. tanaka faced a mostly major league lineup in his start on sunday against the atlanta braves and encountered few problems through four and a third innings, striking out six while allowing one run and three hits in a 7-4 yankees win. it was not just that tanaka got outs with seeming ease, but also that he continued to get swing-and-miss strikes against established major league hitters. \"that's what i like to see,\" catcher brian mccann said. \"when you have swing-and-miss stuff and you can attack the zone with four pitches, it's special. there aren't many guys who can get their pitches to move like that.\" mccann was held back at the last minute from heading to panama with a yankees split-squad team that played two weekend games against the miami marlins, mostly so he could work with tanaka, whom the yankees signed in the off-season to a seven-year, $155 million contract. it was also a chance for mccann to play against the braves, his former team, whom he left in the off-season via free agency. \"i was really excited coming to the park and seeing a lot of guys i spent a lot of years with,\" he said. but the guy he saw from behind the plate is what he and the yankees is most excited about. tanaka went 24-0 with a 1.27 earned run average last year in japan, pitching for the rakuten golden eagles. it was impressive, but would it translate to the major leagues? so far, in his two starts and three outings this spring, tanaka has pitched nine and a third innings, yielding seven hits, two earned runs and two walks. he has struck out 10. against the braves, he faced a lineup that included both upton brothers b. j. and justin jason heyward, freddie freeman, dan uggla, andrelton simmons and ryan doumit. only the prospect tommy la stella did any damage, hitting a run-scoring double off the left-field wall in the fourth inning. other than that, tanaka gave up only two singles, one a bunt. \"i wanted to keep the number of pitches a little lower,\" said tanaka, who threw 74, which is a bit high for less than five innings. \"but the result of just giving up one run, i'm satisfied with that.\" high pitch counts are usually the residue of high strikeout tallies, which tanaka is getting even though his top velocity continues to hover in the low-90-mile-per-hour range. \"he gets outs on every pitch he has,\" mccann said. \"he's really good at setting up hitters. he knows what he's doing out there.\" when reminded that tanaka is coming from another country and is only 25 and already showing such mound savvy, mccann nodded his head. \"it beyond surprises me,\" he said. \"but it shows you the experience he has. to be only 25 years old and understand how to maneuver through a lineup is really impressive.\" tanaka is next scheduled to pitch saturday against the minnesota twins, and the yankees expect more of the same. \"he's handled everything with ease, as if he's done it before,\" general manager brian cashman said. \"it feels like he's always been a part of this team and this organization. the transition has been transitionless.\" the only negative for the yankees on sunday was that center fielder jacoby ellsbury, signed in the off-season to a seven-year, $153 million contract, was scratched before the game with tightness in his right calf. he will also sit out monday's game against the pittsburgh pirates in bradenton, fla. that puts ellsbury in line to play again tuesday, which happens to be when the yankees host his former team, the boston red sox. \"i really haven't thought about it,\" ellsbury said. he added that had sunday's game against the braves been a regular-season game, the tightness he felt in his calf would not have prevented him from playing. \"he wanted to play and he could've played, except we wanted to make sure we knock this thing out before anything serious happened,\" said the third-base coach rob thomson, who is filling in for joe girardi as the manager while girardi and the rest of the team are in panama. inside pitch the left-hander manny banuelos, who returned this spring from tommy john elbow surgery, was optioned to class a tampa. in two spring outings, banuelos allowed four hits, seven runs, three walks and a home run. ... shortstop brendan ryan, slowed this spring with a sore lower back, hit off a tee and took grounders sunday. he had been swinging a broomstick. rob thomson said ryan was close to playing in a spring game. ... russ canzler, who is nursing a sore left hip, has improved but still has not taken part in any on-field work. ... ichiro suzuki collected two solid hits, one of them a double, while also drawing a walk in four plate appearances.",

        "abstract": "the hague shortly before the announcement of a genocide verdict on thursday for radovan karadzic, the former bosnian serb leader, security guards at the united nations war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia received an extraordinary order from the court presidency: they were told to arrest a french journalist, florence hartmann, who could be found outside the tribunal gates with survivors of the bosnian war. they did arrest her, assisted by the dutch police, who pushed back onlookers and bosnian war victims who tried to protect her. since then, ms. hartmann, a former correspondent for le monde, has been locked up at the tribunal prison on the outskirts of the hague to serve a pending seven-day sentence for a contempt of court conviction from 2009. she is in an isolated section of the jail, said guenael mettraux, her lawyer. \"the idea is that she cannot mingle with anyone, either war crimes suspects or convicts, even if she wanted to,\" he said. ms. hartmann is being kept on a suicide watch, which means that the light must stay on 24 hours a day so that guards can check on her every 15 minutes, mr. mettraux said. these are standard operating procedures for arriving war criminals, but the lawyer said treating a journalist this way was \"incomprehensible.\" ms. hartmann's case has baffled tribunal lawyers for some time. she reported on the 1990s war in yugoslavia for le monde and then served as the spokeswoman for the tribunal prosecutor, carla del ponte. after leaving her job, she wrote a book, titled \"peace and punishment,\" and an article, parts of which angered several judges. ms. hartmann was convicted of contempt of court in 2009 for writing about how tribunal judges had agreed that sensitive records provided by serbia could be used in closed sessions of the court but kept out of the public eye. she said that she had not revealed the contents of the records, but that the victims had a right to know about the deal that kept them confidential. other journalists and mrs. del ponte have also written about the negotiations over these records, which involve the minutes of the wartime meetings of the supreme defense council led by slobodan milosevic, who was the serbian president at the time. the records, which were much coveted by the tribunal prosecutors, offered insight into serbia's role in the bosnian war from 1992 to 1995. unlike the others, ms. hartmann was prosecuted and convicted of contempt of court because of her references to the judges' confidential decisions. she was originally fined 7,000 euros, but the sentence was converted to seven days in prison. she says she stole no tribunal records and obtained her information from sources in serbia.",

        "abstract": "washington in a pair of unanimous decisions, the supreme court on tuesday made it easier for the winning side in patent cases to recover its legal fees from the loser. the decisions were welcomed by some technology companies, which said the rulings would help address what they say are abusive and coercive lawsuits brought by \"patent trolls,\" or companies that buy patents not to use them but to collect royalties and damages. the first case, octane fitness v. icon health & fitness , no. 12-1184, was brought by a maker of exercise equipment against a smaller competitor, accusing it of violating a patent. the smaller company, octane fitness, won after paying $1.3 million in legal fees. it asked lower courts to order the larger company, icon health & fitness, to reimburse it. federal patent law allows such fee shifting in \"exceptional cases.\" the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit, a specialized court in washington that hears patent cases, interpreted that to set a high bar. fees may be awarded, it has said , if the suit in question was tainted by misconduct or was \"brought in subjective bad faith\" and \"is objectively baseless.\" that standard was \"unduly rigid,\" justice sonia sotomayor wrote for the supreme court. all that the winning side need show to be awarded fees, she said, was that the case was exceptional in the sense that it \"stands out from others\" given the strength of the losing side's position or its conduct in the litigation. justice sotomayor wrote that the federal circuit had erred in other ways, too. winners should not always be required to prove both that their adversaries had acted in subjective bad faith and that the losing side's claims were objectively baseless. and winners, she added, should not be required to prove their entitlement to fees by \"clear and convincing\" evidence, a demanding level of proof. the supreme court returned the case to the lower courts for application of the new standards. in a footnote reproducing emails from icon officials, justice sotomayor suggested that they might have acted with subjective bad faith. justice sotomayor also wrote for the court in the second case, highmark v. allcare health management system , no. 12-1163. she said appeals courts should not lightly second-guess trial court decisions awarding legal fees in patent disputes. the new york times company submitted a supporting brief in the cases. it urged the court to make it easier to obtain fee awards, saying that would protect innovation.",

        "abstract": "gov. andrew m. cuomo has been raising money at a pace of $1 million per month this year, an impressive haul that fortifies his standing as he looks toward a re-election bid next year. in campaign finance disclosures on friday, mr. cuomo, a democrat, reported a balance of $27.8 million in his campaign account, up from $22.5 million in january. the growth reinforces his reputation as a formidable fund-raiser, an important credential should he seek to run for president in 2016 . most of mr. cuomo's fund-raising has come from deep-pocketed donors, including many real estate developers and wall street figures. among the contributors were several billionaires: kenneth g. langone, a prominent republican donor, gave $50,000; carl c. icahn contributed $25,000; and ronald o. perelman donated $50,000. another billionaire, john a. catsimatidis, the supermarket magnate who is running for mayor of new york city as a republican, donated $19,000. his wife, margo, donated $60,000 but also received a refund from the cuomo campaign of $13,603.79. mr. cuomo received $125,000 in contributions from the real estate developer leonard litwin, who has given him $625,000 since december 2010, according to an analysis by bill mahoney, research coordinator for the new york public interest research group. mr. cuomo has also helped raise a significant amount of money for the state democratic party, which reported contributions of more than $6 million over the last six months. the hedge fund billionaire james h. simons donated $1 million, and george soros contributed $750,000. mr. cuomo has spent relatively sparingly this year, but has benefited from spending by the state party, which spent most of the money it raised on television advertising supporting the governor's legislative agenda. mr. cuomo, although lower in the polls than he once was, remains popular. the state republican party has sharpened its criticism of the governor in recent months, but has thus far not been able to recruit a prominent challenger, and mr. cuomo's large campaign account will make that task difficult. one republican who has talked about running for governor, steven f. mclaughlin, an assemblyman from the capital region, reported $20,102.77 in his campaign account less than one-tenth of 1 percent of mr. cuomo's balance. the finance disclosures came three weeks after this year's legislative session ended without action on proposals to overhaul the state's often-criticized campaign finance system, which permits contributions significantly larger than those allowed in many other states and new york city. mr. cuomo had said that changing the system was a priority, although some liberals viewed his effort as late and lackluster. meanwhile, mr. cuomo is continuing to raise large sums. on friday, he hosted a fund-raiser in syracuse where donors were invited to consider giving $25,000 or more. according to the ynn cable network, he arrived at the event with joanne m. mahoney, the onondaga county executive; last week, mr. cuomo named ms. mahoney to a commission to investigate public corruption among elected officials.",

        "abstract": "beijing china 's official news agency reported on friday that gao zhisheng, a prominent human rights lawyer who has been missing for more than 20 months, will serve the next three years in prison because he repeatedly violated his probation. the brief statement from a beijing court provoked fresh outrage among human rights advocates who characterize mr. gao's case as a leading example of abuse of dissidents in china. although said to be free on probation for the past five years, mr. gao has been missing for much of the time since he was sentenced in 2006 for inciting subversion of state power. his older brother, gao zhiyi, told the group china human rights defenders that the court's announcement proves that mr. gao has been in police custody even though the public security authorities have insisted that they had no knowledge of his whereabouts. gao zhiyi said he last saw his brother in april 2010 in the custody of public security officers; he is worried that his brother may be dead. renee xia, one of the directors of the human rights group, said that the court's declaration \"is the clearest acknowledgement to date by the chinese government that it has secretly detained gao for the last 20 months despite its repeated denials.\" human rights advocates say secret detentions and disappearances have become a common tactic for chinese authorities to suppress dissidents, especially since february, when the government began to fear that the arab spring uprisings would spread to china. the government is currently considering revising its criminal procedure law in a manner that human rights lawyers say would effectively legalize secret detentions. western governments and the united nations have persistently pressed china to release mr. gao, 47, who once defended practitioners of falun gong, a religious group banned in china. in march, a united nations working group on arbitrary detention said mr. gao's unexplained disappearance amounted to punishment for his defense of human rights. nicholas bequelin, a researcher for human rights watch, said the announcement did not alleviate concerns about mr. gao's treatment or whereabouts. \"the people who saw him more than 20 months ago described him as a ghost,\" mr. bequelin said. \"we have absolutely no details about his condition now.\" amnesty international said in a statement that mr. gao had already been held captive for much longer than his original three-year prison term that had supposedly been suspended. jerome a. cohen, a specialist on the chinese legal system, said mr. gao was clearly a victim of \"extra-legal punishment.\" he said in an e-mail: \"i have used the case repeatedly as a leading example of a disturbing trend of lawlessness on the part of china's police. now they have belatedly found the figleaf.\" mr. gao was known for taking on politically sensitive cases. he was sentenced to probation in december 2006, and subsequently disappeared three times. during the short periods when he resurfaced, he told reporters that he had been tortured. at various points, he said, he was beaten with electric batons and handguns, forced to wear a hood over his head, tied up with belts, made to sit motionless for up to 16 hours and threatened with death. he said one guard told him: \"you must forget you are human. you are a beast.\" after her husband's 2006 conviction, mr. gao's wife fled to the united states, where she now lives with his daughter. according to one supporter's account, mr. gao may have also tried to escape but was caught.",

        "title": "japan takes step toward reviving nuclear industry as it restarts reactor.",
        "abstract": "tokyo for more than four years since the nuclear meltdowns in fukushima in 2011, japan has been debating whether it should permanently abandon a technology that went so disastrously wrong but that for years was seen as essential to its economy. governments have offered differing answers. the public has sent confusing signals. but on tuesday, the country took what appeared to be a decisive step toward resurrecting the nuclear industry and ending a de facto freeze on the use of atomic power, as an electric utility restarted one of dozens of reactors that were taken offline after the fukushima disaster . the reactor at the sendai nuclear power plant, in kagoshima prefecture, was the first to return to service since government regulators introduced upgraded safety standards two years ago. most of japan's 48 operable commercial nuclear reactors were shut down soon after the meltdowns at fukushima, and none have operated since 2013. the government of prime minister shinzo abe supports restarting idled reactors that meet the enhanced safety standards, arguing that japan's economy depends on the low-cost power they provide. japan has few domestic energy sources, and it imports virtually all the fossil fuels it uses to power its homes and factories. electricity prices in the country have increased 20 percent or more since the fukushima disaster, squeezing households and businesses and obstructing efforts by mr. abe to stimulate the economy. emissions of greenhouse gases have risen sharply, too. the public remains skeptical about the plants' safety, however, with surveys consistently showing that most japanese favor closing the idled reactors permanently. a group of 150 to 200 protesters, including a former prime minister who turned against nuclear power after fukushima, gathered outside the sendai plant on tuesday as the police stood guard, the japanese news media reported. \"by moving ahead with restarts, the abe administration is leading a doomed country,\" the former prime minister, naoto kan, was quoted as saying. image a demonstration against restarting a reactor at the sendai nuclear power plant on the japanese island of kyushu on tuesday. credit jiji press, via agence france-presse getty images mr. kan was in office in 2011 during the crisis at the fukushima daiichi power plant, which occurred after a huge tsunami struck the site in northeastern japan and knocked out its cooling systems, setting off meltdowns at three of its six reactors and spreading contamination across a wide area. more than 100,000 people were evacuated, and many have yet to return home . but public opposition to nuclear power has not translated into victories for antinuclear politicians like mr. kan. not long after the fukushima accident, his government announced a policy of gradually phasing out nuclear power, but that foundered after his center-left party was defeated in an election in 2012. the more conservative, pro-nuclear party that replaced it , led by mr. abe, has won two subsequent parliamentary elections, despite its unpopular stance on nuclear energy. its support has recently slipped, however, amid a separate and equally contentious political battle over defense policy , so the reactivation of a nuclear plant comes at a delicate time. \"abe has kept his focus on the economy, and the opposition is weak, so he has managed to win people's support in spite of the fact that most don't like his defense and nuclear policies,\" shinichi nishikawa, a professor at meiji university, said. \"but the limits of that approach are starting to show.\" the government and power companies have certainly tried to move cautiously. plans to restart sendai and other reactors have been in place since the revised safety regulations were introduced more than two years ago. the plants need to be retrofitted with new ventilation systems and other protections, and operators have needed to court local political leaders for endorsements to switch them back on. the sendai plant was declared safe by regulators nearly a year ago, in september 2014. how extensive japan's nuclear revival will ultimately be remains unclear. some of the 48 operable reactors around the country are considered too old to be worth the cost of retrofitting to meet the new safety standards. concerns about earthquake faults found under or near others have kept them from winning approval from the government regulatory body, which was reorganized and given more independence after the fukushima disaster. power companies have applied for safety certification for about half the 48 units. so far only five, including the one restarted at sendai, have been declared safe. the utility that owns the sendai plant, kyushu electric power, said it removed control rods from the core of the reactor at 10:30 a.m. on tuesday, initiating the atomic reaction that will eventually produce electricity. it plans to start producing and transmitting electricity for its customers next month. the national broadcaster nhk aired video of workers in the plant's control room as they restarted the reactor. tomomitsu sakata, a spokesman for kyushu electric power, said the reactor had been put back online without any problems.",

        "title": "with cano negotiations looming, yankees are bound to like pedroia's reported deal.",
        "abstract": "arlington, tex. ordinarily, when a division rival locks up a star player with a contract extension, it is not reason to celebrate. but there had to be a few smiles at yankee stadium on tuesday when word came that dustin pedroia, the boston red sox second baseman, had agreed to a seven-year, $100 million contract, according to several published reports. the development is intriguing to the yankees because their own second baseman, robinson cano, will be a free agent after the season and is thought to be seeking a contract that could be more than twice the value of pedroia's. he may even pursue a deal worth as much as alex rodriguez's 10-year, $275 million deal. cano has been in contract talks with the yankees since they made an offer in spring training. while cano is not bound to take a deal comparable to pedroia's, the fact that a star player has set the bar for top second basemen at $14.29 million per year could hurt cano's leverage in negotiations. but if he gets to free agency, all it takes is one team to make a gargantuan offer. cano has significantly more power than pedroia, which counts for a lot. cano has 198 home runs and 353 doubles in nine seasons, compared to pedroia's 96 homers and 270 doubles in eight seasons. otherwise, they are similar. pedroia will turn 30 on aug. 17. cano will turn 31 on oct. 22. pedroia has a career .303 batting average, a .371 on-base percentage and a .457 slugging percentage. cano's line is .308/.354/.505. both play very well defensively, although with considerably different styles. cano, with his relaxed approach, is arguably the most gifted second baseman in baseball. pedroia is more about hustle and grit, but he gets the job done and is considered a team leader, while cano is more content to remain in the background. they share something else: each has won a championship. hafner sits travis hafner, who has not hit a home run in almost a month, was left out of tuesday's lineup as his confounding slump shows no sign of ending. image dustin pedroia, making a play tuesday, has a new seven-year, $100 million deal with the red sox, according to reports. credit jim rogash/getty images hafner, a left-handed hitter, usually plays against right-handed pitchers. but even with the right-handed alexi ogando throwing for the texas rangers, hafner sat. manager joe girardi said the move was not a permanent demotion, but a chance to give hafner a day to breathe and to get melky mesa in the game in left field. girardi said that with phil hughes starting for the yankees, he wanted mesa's defense for the fly balls that hughes often gives up. girardi also said he wanted to keep vernon wells in the lineup as the designated hitter because he has had good at-bats lately. \"hitting is tough,\" girardi said. \"it kept us all up at night during some point in our careers, thinking about it, because it's difficult. but i'm not giving up on him. he's not playing today, but that doesn't mean i'm giving up on him.\" since hitting .318 with six home runs the first month of the season, hafner has batted .172 with six homers and 59 strikeouts in 50 games. hafner was signed on the eve of spring training to a one-year, $2 million contract to help replace raul ibanez, who signed with the seattle mariners. since a shoulder injury earlier this year, hafner has been tinkering with his swing, but said the injury had cleared up and had not been a factor in his slump. he said he understood the decision to leave him out of the lineup, but said the lack of hits had taken its toll mentally. \"it definitely wears on you a little bit,\" hafner said. garza to pitch matt garza, whom the rangers acquired from the chicago cubs on monday, is scheduled to pitch on wednesday against the yankees. garza, who pitched for the minnesota twins and the tampa bay rays from 2006 until 2010, is 1-4 against the yankees with a 4.48 earned run average in 11 starts. \"it's been a few years, but we've seen a lot of him and he's a pitcher that's had success pretty much anywhere he's been,\" joe girardi said. \"he's got very good stuff, he seems pretty durable. he's pitched in the american league east, which is not the easiest place to pitch. he's pitched in pennant races. so, you'd expect it to be a good acquisition for the rangers.\" jeter takes b.p. derek jeter took batting practice for the first time since his quadriceps injury july 11 , took ground balls and ran sprints in the outfield without problems. he is eligible to come off the disabled list saturday and still believes he can make that date. ... luis cruz, who injured his knee monday night while sliding to catch a ball, was sore on tuesday and not in the starting lineup. brent lillibridge took his place at third.",

        "title": "magnet schools find a renewed embrace in cities.",
        "abstract": "miami nearly five decades ago, as racial tension raged in cities, magnet schools were introduced here and elsewhere as an alternative to court-ordered busing in the hope that specialized theme schools would slow white flight and offer options to racial minorities zoned for low-performing schools. magnet schools never quite delivered on that desegregation promise, and in the past couple of decades they have largely fallen off the radar. but in this multiracial city and, increasingly, in other urban districts including chicago, dallas, denver, los angeles, newark and washington public school leaders are refocusing on the idea as traditional public schools come under increasing pressure from charter schools and vouchers for private schools. the number of children in miami-dade county attending magnet programs which admit students from anywhere in the district and focus on themes like art, law or technology has grown by 35 percent in the past four years. these children now account for about one in six students in the district. the pattern is similar across the country. there are now about 2.8 million students attending magnet schools more than the nearly 2.6 million enrolled in charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated. magnets have \"become kind of a go-to alternative as a way to incorporate some of the popular elements of choice while keeping the choice constrained more explicitly within the traditional district,\" said jeffrey r. henig, a professor of political science and education at columbia university. \"it's a recognition on the part of districts that at least some of the enthusiasm and popularity of charters is a resistance to the notion of a one-size-fits-all school.\" because magnets are fully part of public school systems their teachers are unionized and they follow district rules, while charters are run by private entities and are typically not unionized reviving them is seen as part of an effort to save public schools. still, critics worry that magnets, like charter schools and vouchers, could drain zoned neighborhood schools of the most motivated students and increase racial segregation. \"with completely unregulated choice, there are people who choose and those who choose not to choose,\" said richard d. kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the century foundation. \"so the most unmotivated parents will just get assigned to a school, and motivated parents will eyeball a school racially and ethnically to see if their child will 'fit in.' \" although students in miami can still attend zoned schools, scores of parents entered their children last month in a lottery for admission to one of the county's 363 magnet programs. on the last day to submit paperwork, susette holder stood in line in a hallway at the district office downtown to apply for high-school spots for her 13-year-old twins. \"i did not want to send them to the neighborhood school,\" ms. holder said. \"one wants to go into law enforcement and the other wants music, and our area does not provide that.\" the federal government awards grants to districts to open or expand magnet schools with the explicit aim of increasing diversity, but charter schools receive about four times as much federal money and are not required to meet integration goals. the recent push in miami was spurred in part by growing competition from charters, which have increased enrollment by 48 percent in the past four years. but proponents of magnet schools also say that when students are engaged in classes that reflect their interests, they are more likely to attend school, avoid disciplinary problems and graduate. alberto m. carvalho, superintendent of schools in miami-dade county, said it made less and less sense to put students \"through the same 7:30 to 2:30, bell-to-bell instruction without allowing them some degree of individuality.\" three years ago, mr. carvalho founded a magnet school called ipreparatory academy, in which students spend much of their time working independently, often lounging with laptops on ikea sofas and beanbag chairs. the district has added similar programs on nine campuses around the district. supporters of magnet schools say that to increase diversity, districts must make a concerted effort to inform all parents of their options. in some communities, said scott thomas, executive director of magnet schools of america , \"you have to know the secret handshake to even get the application,\" a situation that tends to favor the most educated and assertive parents. in miami-dade county where close to three-quarters of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches and more than two-thirds of students are hispanic, many with parents who speak little or no english principals and recruiters from magnet schools attend numerous fairs, talking to families and distributing glossy brochures. last year, said robert strickland, director of school choice in the district, officials produced video spots that ran in movie theaters and made robocalls to families at home. teachers unions argue that districts need to prioritize community-based schools. \"i think if every one of the schools in a system are good, the vast majority of people will stay in their neighborhood,\" said dennis van roekel, president of the national education association, the nation's largest teachers union. miami-dade county is bigger than the state of rhode island, so many students opt for their neighborhood school simply because some magnets are so far away. public transportation is sparse and the school district does not guarantee bus seats for students who select magnet programs, although it has started to replicate the most popular magnet themes across the county. most of the magnets admit students through a lottery, but most arts programs require auditions or portfolio submissions, and many schools set prerequisites such as specific math or science courses or a minimum grade point average. some of the most coveted magnets, which receive far more applications than they have seats, do not represent the demographics of the district. at coral reef senior high school, a prestigious magnet that includes programs in the arts, engineering and an international baccalaureate track, less than half of the 3,229 students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, and close to a fifth are white, compared with just 7.7 percent of the district. african-american students, who represent close to a quarter of the district, are only 13.5 percent of the student body at coral reef. long-held perceptions can affect who applies to some magnets in the first place. patrisha hedgemond, an 18-year-old senior at coral reef, said she had applied to the school's legal academy because she wanted to leave her neighborhood peers. \"some of those students don't have the oomph to want to strive,\" ms. hedgemond said. most of her friends from middle school did not even apply to coral reef: \"they didn't believe they could get in,\" she said. some parents see magnets as a way to give their children advantages they never had. dollie west, a legal secretary, helped her son, javon alexander, 14, apply to magnet high schools. he is currently a freshman at a school that opened in the fall on a campus of florida international university. the program, modeled on the popular maritime and science technology magnet school in the elite community of key biscayne, focuses on marine science and biology and will eventually allow students to enroll in college courses. ms. west believes that attending school with peers who have similar academic interests will keep javon motivated. \"for me, as a parent of a young black male, and with statistics in the society being against him, i can prove the statistics wrong,\" she said. javon said he chose the new academy because he enjoyed watching programs about marine science on the discovery channel. one morning last month, he was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with \"3lc\" that he and his friends had designed. \"it's the 3 life crew,\" javon said during a biology class, where students were learning about the major lobes of the brain. \"it's a group of kids who do well in school.\"",

        "abstract": "general motors is aiming to file an initial public offering of stock in mid-august, taking its biggest step yet toward repaying the federal government, people briefed on the matter said on friday. the company, which emerged from bankruptcy last july, is also seeking a $5 billion credit line, these people said, cautioning that the specific terms and the amounts that various banks would contribute had yet to be determined. a mid-august filing would put g.m. on track to go public by the end of the year, a timeline the company has already hinted is its goal. the carmaker has selected morgan stanley and jpmorgan chase as the lead underwriters for the offering, people briefed on the matter said previously. the treasury department has hired the investment bank lazard as an adviser. \"i can't have a date, but i think this is a good year to do it if we can get everything done,\" edward e. whitacre jr., g.m.'s chief executive, told reporters in texas on thursday, according to reuters. \"i think it's a great year.\" g.m. and the federal government have sought to stage an offering as soon as is practical, though both have said that the company will ultimately determine when to go public. through its sponsorship of the automaker's quick bankruptcy last summer including more than $50 billion in loans the treasury department holds an approximately 61 percent stake in the company. the government would like to reduce its stake significantly to become a minority shareholder, and g.m. also wishes to raise money, possibly creating one of the biggest offerings in recent years. the company has declined to comment on the possible valuation. the final details will depend in part on market conditions, and the recent whipsaws in the market have made a big offering somewhat risky. \"our stakeholders obviously will want it to be successful, so we'll do our best to project the best timing for that,\" said noreen pratscher, a g.m. spokeswoman. rebecca lindland, an automotive analyst with the research firm ihs automotive, said access to additional credit was important to make sure g.m. could weather any bumps in the economic recovery or its own turnaround. she added that the ford motor company's decision to borrow $23 billion in 2006 allowed it to avoid bankruptcy. \"we've seen that cash is not always easy to get, and there's a level of weakness that everyone's sort of feeling in the economy,\" ms. lindland said. \"it's a good idea just to have it in their back pocket if they need it. i see it as a little bit of an insurance policy for them.\" ms. pratscher declined to comment on any talks with lenders. \"securing a credit revolver is a prudent thing to do,\" she said. on thursday, automakers reported that new-vehicle sales in the united states fell 10 percent from may, raising concerns about how well the market was recovering. g.m.'s sales were 12 percent higher than a year ago, but 13 percent lower than the previous month. still, g.m. officials say the company is making great progress. its four active brands in the united states chevrolet, buick, cadillac and gmc sold 12 percent more vehicles in the first half of 2010 than the company did with eight brands in the first half of 2009. mr. whitacre told analysts at a gathering this week that the prebankruptcy g.m. was \"overly complicated\" and \"hamstrung by a tendency to overanalyze and overthink even the smallest decisions.\" g.m.'s ability to perform today is in large part the result of changing that culture, he said. at the same event, christopher p. liddell, g.m.'s chief financial officer, laid out goals of eliminating the company's debt and returning to a \"strong investment grade\" credit rating. he said g.m. could make money and did to the tune of $865 million in the first quarter, its first profit since 2007 at lower volumes because its operations are so much more efficient now. \"it's a fundamentally different company in terms of its break-even point,\" mr. liddell said. \"what's new about the new g.m.? really everything.\"",

        "title": "an ex-inmate's lost decade under the rockefeller drug laws.",
        "abstract": "the last time louis carrasquillo was arrested, on sutphin boulevard in south jamaica, queens, he was 45 years old. it was 1995, and he had been getting high for 35 years; he started sniffing glue when he was 10, and was injecting heroin by 13. he had been arrested before, and spent time in state prison in the 1980s for the criminal sale of a controlled substance, though he said he sold drugs only when he needed money to support his habit. on that day, he was selling again, holding six $10 bags of crack cocaine. mr. carrasquillo sold two of the bags to an undercover police officer. he went to trial and was convicted, and, for the $20 deal, a judge gave him 12 1/2 to 25 years. so began one man's experience with the rockefeller drug laws, the statutes requiring long sentences for nonviolent and even first-time offenders, which made new york's policy among the toughest in the country. the laws took effect in 1973 and were eased somewhat in 2004 and 2005, around the time, coincidentally, that mr. carrasquillo was finally getting clean after nine years of heroin use behind prison walls. there is talk of ending the laws. the assembly speaker, sheldon silver, is a vocal advocate of changing them, as is governor paterson. in february, a state commission recommended allowing judges more leeway to sentence offenders to treatment programs. in one sense, this prospect comes too late for mr. carrasquillo, who was released from prison last april, having served his 12 1/2 years. but he will be watching keenly what happens in albany, he said in a recent interview, and he thinks that his experiences may be instructive. mr. carrasquillo was speaking from samaritan village, a residential drug treatment center in the highbridge section of the bronx, where he lives. he checked into the center the day after he left prison. he has been doing so well, administrators say, that he is training to be a substance abuse counselor, at a samaritan village branch in midtown. dressed in black corduroys, a gray button-down shirt and white reeboks, and looking for all the world like a retiree, mr. carrasquillo, a 59-year-old brooklyn native, made no excuses for the person he was for most of his life. though he sometimes held onto jobs the longest as a truck driver he admits that he was an addict, a thief and a batterer of women. \"i was uncaring, selfish, self-centered, mean, spiteful,\" he said. \"that was me.\" of the heroin, he added: \"it just made me an animal. i didn't care about anything. my own family, i didn't care about. all i cared about was to get those drugs.\" yet there is another truth: prison did not help. it did not help him stop using drugs they were readily available on the inside, he said and it did not make him a better person. in fact, he said, it made him and many other inmates worse. his cellmates included a double murderer and a man who had been arrested for possession of more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine. (both were serving 25 years to life, roughly double mr. carrasquillo's sentence for selling $20 worth of crack.) \"it's not a deterrent, because they come out bitter, angry, confused, and they just go back where they left off,\" he said of prison. \"there, you're so busy thinking about survival that you don't have time to make changes in yourself.\" what finally enabled him to leave the drugs behind was the ability that he found in treatment to speak openly and fearlessly, first in a tiny addiction program he entered near the end of his sentence, and later at samaritan village, where he considers the other residents a second family. mr. carrasquillo said he was thinking about getting treatment in the days before he was arrested. whether that would have happened is unknown. the only certainty is what happened next: a lost decade behind bars and, much later, in treatment programs, a measure of peace. before, he said, heroin was his closest companion. now he can be around for his parents, and he can help other addicts. and at long last, he has a life of his own. he has been clean since april 4, 2005, and that is still a source of wonder. \"today it's 10:30, and i didn't get high,\" mr. carrasquillo said. \"that's a miracle.\"",

        "abstract": "someday, there will be light at the end of the tunnels. on two sides of manhattan, snaking skeletons of underground rails are finally being built or extended, promising to connect two areas to new york city's transportation grid. on the east side, the wait has seemed endless. the second avenue line has been staggering and stalling since 1929, when the city first decided it should be built. on the far west side, the promise is much newer: it was only with the commercial and residential rezoning of hudson yards in 2005, and of the adjacent western railyard in 2009, that the decision was made to roll the no. 7 train toward the hudson river. since then, silver mirrored giants, flashy developments and hip restaurants and stores have sprung up in anticipation of the extension of the train from times square to 34th street and 11th avenue . \"i used to buy my produce at duane reade,\" said justin champa, who moved to 11th avenue two years ago, and was eating dinner at choza taqueria in gotham west market on a recent night. now, there are three gourmet grocery stores within walking distance of his apartment. image alice mccarney owns alice hair, a salon on second avenue between 69th and 70th streets that was blocked by construction for four years. \"you don't know about the second avenue cough?\" she said. \"i don't have it because my lungs are already polluted.\" credit michael appleton for the new york times \"people always ask me, 'why would you ever live there?' \" he said. \"my go-to line is, 'the lincoln tunnel is beautiful this time of year.' \" mr. champa said he came to the area for the value and the amenities offered by the newly built skyscraper he lives in. \"it's nice to be here in a transitional period,\" he said. \"there's a lot of great new stuff coming in, but it's not too crowded yet.\" but on the east side, the second avenue subway has been so long-promised that it seemed near-mythical to residents and business owners. construction finally began in 2007, wreaking havoc in the neighborhood. residents have been evicted, storefronts have been shuttered and the \"second avenue cough\" has set in. \"you don't know about the second avenue cough ?\" said alice mccarney, who owns alice hair, a salon on second avenue between 69th and 70th streets. \"i don't have it because my lungs are already polluted,\" she said with a laugh, \"but loads of other people had it because of all the dust.\" but the metropolitan transportation authority rejects the idea that such a construction-related malady exists. a spokesman, adam lisberg, said the agency had \"scrupulously enforced air quality standards on second avenue subway construction and used state-of-the-art scrubber technology to limit the impact on the surrounding community.\" image a detour for pedestrians around a construction site on second avenue. credit michael appleton for the new york times \"we have continuously monitored air quality on the project and posted the results weekly on our website, showing that we not only exceed air quality standards, but also strive to minimize the impact of construction,\" mr. lisberg continued. ms. mccarney opened her salon 12 years ago, when no one thought the subway would ever be built. her storefront was blocked by construction for four years, she said, with smokestacks and other construction materials blocking her awning and any natural light until this past january. she said her business would not have survived if she had not already had a loyal clientele. \"i didn't sign up for any of the construction,\" she said in her salon recently, \"but i did dress up as a second avenue construction worker for halloween last year.\" and though the blasting in phase 1, from 96th to 63rd street, is now finished, she still has complaints: \"what's the subway going to bring me? i won't be able to survive if there's a subway escalator right next to my store,\" she said, explaining that the rents would be too high. she is planning to relocate her business when her lease is up in 2017. most of the businesses on her block were evicted to make room for construction, she said. \"the neighborhood has really gone downhill, but now the rents are going up,\" she added. phase 1 service is scheduled to begin in december 2016, said kevin ortiz, a spokesman for the transportation authority. although rents largely dropped in the area during construction, they are expected to jump within the next two years, said jordan skurnik, a real estate broker who works extensively in the area. for now, he said, buyers can take advantage of lower prices, but sellers need to be \"sensitive with their pricing\" in the interim. trudy gordon owns an apartment on second avenue, which she has rented to the same tenant for the past five years. now, her tenant is moving out and she cannot find a new one, she said. \"there's a huge crane in front of my building, which is not too attractive,\" she said, \"and my broker told me everybody is asking about the noise and the subway.\" image light poles at a construction site on second avenue. the first phase is scheduled to open by december 2016. credit michael appleton for the new york times ms. gordon lives in florida, and bought the apartment as an investment. she said that she took about a $700 loss on the apartment every month, but that she wanted to hold onto it until the subway was finished, hoping she could make a profit. others have found ways to take advantage of the low rent. ruairi curtin opened his fifth bar, the penrose, on second avenue in june 2012. \"we opened during construction, so we've never had our storefront facing the street,\" he said. \"it can only get better from here.\" \"the construction definitely gave us a lot of bargaining chips with the landlord,\" mr. curtin said. \"we were completely aware of what we were coming into and there was little risk the neighborhood was underserved for somewhere like this.\" with a spacious bar, exposed brick and vintage trunks for decor, and a pickle-juice martini on the menu, the penrose is designed to attract the young professionals mr. curtin already sees flocking to the area, lured as he was by the low rent and opportunity. image lauren wiener, alexander james and their 4-month-old, charlie, in the backyard garden outside their hell's kitchen apartment. \"i never thought i'd end up in this part of town,\" mr. james said, \"but i love living here.\" credit michael appleton for the new york times but three other restaurants on the block have closed in the last year, mr. curtin said, their papered-over windows part of the aftermath of years of the construction underground. schaller & weber, a german butcher shop on 86th street that opened in 1937, is another survivor, a relic of yorkville's teutonic past. \"we've lost 20 percent of our business every year for the last three years,\" said chris cunningham, the manager, but he added, \"as soon as that construction stuff outside comes down, people will come back in. \"six months after it comes down, people will say, 'oh, it wasn't that bad.' we're optimists.\" mr. ortiz said the transportation authority did not provide financial support to businesses affected by construction but tried \"to mitigate the impact on businesses and residents alike.\" on 11th avenue the mood is sunnier. to extend the no. 7 line, the transportation authority bored a new tunnel from 26th street and 11th avenue to times square, where the 7 line now ends. except for digging at those two locations, the only aboveground construction was at 34th street and 11th avenue, right underneath hudson yards. image construction on the far west side of manhattan. credit michael appleton for the new york times because the area was not a commercial or residential zone until recently, there was no one to be displaced or disrupted at the 34th street location, said mr. ortiz. the authority had planned to build a station at 41st street and 10th avenue, but dropped it because of budgeting constraints. on 42nd street and 10th avenue facing west, four new luxury towers rise above an area that used to be called hell's kitchen, where low-slung industrial buildings, parking garages and warehouses stood. the developments are rising in anticipation of hudson yards, the planned complex on 34th street and 11th avenue, which will bring several apartment buildings, a gourmet supermarket, shops and office space. eight different vendors offer menu items like ramen noodles and blue bottle coffee at gotham west market , an open food court on the ground floor of a tower at 600 11th avenue, between 44th and 45th streets. employees at gotham west market say the food hall, which is less than a year old, is almost always busy, and a lot of local residents are there around dinner time although not so much in winter, when the river winds whip down the avenue. lauren wiener and her husband, alexander james, who moved to the far west side in 2008, were having dinner there recently: \"oysters on the cheap\" for her, ramen for him. \"i never thought i'd end up in this part of town,\" mr. james said, \"but i love living here.\" they chose it because ms. wiener was working at columbia university and mr. james was working in the financial district. \"we were trying to split the difference,\" he said. their property value has climbed, they said, and the area as a whole has gotten more expensive than it was when they moved in. part of that is because of the promised subway line, scheduled to open in 2015. but ms. wiener and mr. james said they probably would not use it. \"we aren't oriented in that direction, so it doesn't make a big difference for us,\" he said. \"we mostly just ride the a train.\"",

        "abstract": "after a long night of busing tables at a manhattan restaurant and a train ride across much of two boroughs, the compact, baby-faced mexican immigrant climbed the steps of the kingsbridge road subway station in the west bronx and began walking the last few blocks home. it was around 1 a.m. when he turned onto east 196th street from the grand concourse, he realized that two teenage boys were 30 feet behind him. they spoke in spanish, his mother tongue, but in an accent that echoed the caribbean, not his homeland. suddenly they began to run toward him. \"stop or we'll kill you!\" one of them yelled in english. the mexican, who is 38, ran, too; he had heard enough about a recent rash of muggings of his mexican neighbors in the fordham and bedford park areas, including an account of one man beaten so badly he was hospitalized. when he turned around for an instant, he saw the gun. but he didn't stop; screaming for help, he kept going. his cry for help scared off his aggressors. the man's story was one of many told last sunday at our lady of refuge church on briggs avenue. about 30 mexicans had gathered to talk about the robberies and the widespread feeling that because most of them are undocumented workers who are known to carry cash rather than paychecks, they have become favorite prey virtual walking a.t.m.'s. \"they're picked out as targets,\" said msgr. john jenik of our lady of refuge, who ran the meeting. no fewer than 11 members of his congregation took turns describing how they were robbed, some more than once. the muggings took place in the past year, but the rate of attacks has quickened, with half a dozen or so in the last few weeks. most of the victims were held up at gunpoint by teenagers on east 196th street, between the grand concourse and marion avenue, which has become a kind of gantlet. only a few victims called the police. \"it's because they feel they have no rights,\" said reinaldo morales, a local resident who was mugged a few years ago and said he attended the meeting to show solidarity with the victims. the police acknowledge that there has been an uptick in crime but see the situation differently. \"although there's been a recent increase in robberies,\" said inspector edward mullen, a spokesman for the new york police department, \"there is no specific trend or pattern.\" still, the commanding officer of the department's central robbery unit, inspector james shea, met with father jenik on friday to discuss the situation. meanwhile, the mexicans are trying to protect themselves as best they can. one man is taking a taxi home at night from his subway station. a 19-year-old from oaxaca has asked his employer at a bronx fast-food restaurant to pay him incrementally, so his wages can't all be stolen at once. the man who escaped the muggers has arranged for his wife and two children to meet him at the subway station, so they can walk home together. another resident chose a more permanent solution. according to monsignor jenik, that man, who was mugged and badly beaten last november, was admitted to a hospital, where he was further threatened by his attackers. when he was discharged, the man moved out of the neighborhood.",

        "title": "as francis starts over, knicks seem a good fit.",
        "abstract": "the staid look was familiar to anyone who had followed the circuitous career of steve francis. nearly seven years ago, francis walked across a stage at the mci center in washington and entered his n.b.a. career with a blank expression. no smile, no fist pump, no twinkle in the eye. francis had been drafted by the vancouver grizzlies, and he did not hide his disappointment. seven nights ago, francis sat at a table at madison square garden, making his first appearance as a knick after a trade with orlando. everything -- the team, the time, the circumstances -- was different. only the expression seemed the same. no smile, no twinkle. it was a strange first impression, and given the sorry state of the knicks, it caused some understandable consternation: did francis want to be here? or would this be merely another brief and unhappy stop on his rambling n.b.a. path? \"i was fatigued,\" francis explained, waving off any doubts. the news conference was, in fact, the endpoint of what francis called \"not the worst two weeks of my life, but it was the most draining time.\" his relationship with the magic had soured. trade speculation had francis landing in denver, minneapolis, los angeles or new york. he had a fiancee and a 6-month-old daughter to consider. then came a whirlwind day in which francis attended a morning meeting with the magic in east rutherford, n.j., spent three hours on the phone getting updates from his agent, jeff fried, and, finally, made the trek through the lincoln tunnel and headed straight to his news conference. \"there was a lot that happened within the 12-13 hours before i was traded,\" he said. the intrigue, the mixed feelings, the multiple destinations and the exhaustion made for a nice microcosm of francis's career. he is starting over, again. the knicks are francis's fourth n.b.a. team, including one he never played for, the grizzlies. from high school through college, he played for six different schools. that makes 10 new beginnings in 13 years, enough to make anyone road weary. so here is the truth, francis said: he is not only happy to be with the knicks, despite their ghastly record, but he also wants to be with them for the long haul. fried called the knicks \"our first preference by far\" when the trade became inevitable. indeed, francis said he felt it was partly the rough edges that made the knicks attractive to him. francis is owed $62.5 million over next four years, not counting this year. \"i know it probably sounds crazy,\" he said. \"i'm a guy, i have scars as far as the things i've been through in my career. just like coach brown, just like isiah thomas, just like stephon marbury, just like a lot of players on our team.\" it was a surprising explanation. but then, nothing in francis's life has been easy or predictable. he grew up in takoma park, md., with little money and no father. francis was reared by his mother, brenda wilson, who died of cancer in 1995, and by his grandmother, mabel wilson. his mother's death left him so disconsolate, he gave up basketball for two years. it was the first of many detours in his jagged career path. francis led two junior colleges -- san jacinto (tex.) in 1997 and allegany (md.) in 1998 -- to undefeated seasons and berths in the national junior college tournament. by the time he signed with maryland in 1998, he was entering his sixth program in six years. he led the terrapins to 28 victories and a round of 16 berth in 1999. \"he was very unselfish,\" maryland coach gary williams said. \"i think he averaged 13 shots a game, and he could have taken 20 a game with his individual skills.\" n.b.a. scouts were not sure how to classify francis -- as a shoot-first point guard or as an undersized shooting guard -- but his gifts were clear. he had a 43-inch vertical leap, the instincts of a running back and the fearlessness of a street fighter. francis's first move as a pro was a crossover dribble. taken no. 2 over all in the draft, by the vancouver grizzlies, francis demanded to be traded. two months later, francis joined the houston rockets in an 11-player deal. he was criticized on both sides of the border as a pouting prima donna, an image he has fought ever since. \"he rubbed me the wrong way when he came into the league and demanded that vancouver trade him,\" scottie pippen, the former bulls star, told nba.com after the trade last week. francis said, \"there are situations that happened, things you have to mature from.\" in five seasons with houston, his teams won 34, 45, 28, 43 and 45 games. he teamed with cuttino mobley in a frenetic, high-scoring backcourt that ranked among the best statistically in the league. for four seasons under coach rudy tomjanovich, francis was given free rein. but everything changed when the easygoing, player-friendly tomjanovich was replaced by the controlling and uptight jeff van gundy. van gundy helped guide francis to his lone playoff appearance (a 4-1 series loss to the los angeles lakers), but francis was gone two months later, traded to orlando in a package for tracy mcgrady. \"jeff wanted to trade him a soon as jeff took the job,\" said knicks forward maurice taylor, who played for four and a half seasons with the rockets. \"jeff ran a type of system that he didn't really want most of the scoring to come from his point guard.\" under van gundy, francis averaged a career-low 16.6 points a game, down from 21 the previous two seasons. francis seethed. he said he saw the experience differently now. \"i've matured so much,\" he said. he once felt the need to be his team's top scorer, but now francis said he was comfortable playing a more complementary role. referring to van gundy, he said, \"it took me a year or two to realize that he was just trying to help his team get better and help me get better.\" yet there was another bad ending in orlando. on jan. 11, francis defied coach brian hill, refusing to re-enter the game in the final minutes of a blowout loss to seattle. he was suspended for two games, prompting the trade talks that culminated with last week's deal. \"he was eager to get out of the situation he was in,\" mobley, now with the clippers, said by phone. so francis, who bounced through a half-dozen schools, who forced his way out of canada and who was kicked out of houston, was on the move again. \"i still have time left in my career that i can help this team win games and get to places that they haven't been in a long time,\" francis said. \"one of my goals is to leave the garden with my jersey hanging from the rafters. when i got traded, i went into the gym and i was looking up at the history, the legacy of that arena. now that i'm one of them, i'm thinking what can i do to get myself up there, what can i do to help my team get one of those banners.\"",

        "abstract": "if you're seeing a wave of facebook friends suddenly checking in to the standing rock indian reservation in cannon ball, n.d., online, it's probably not because they've decided to travel to the site of tense protests between the police and activists against the dakota access oil pipeline. supporters of the protesters appear to be falsely checking in out of solidarity online in hopes of confusing law enforcement officials they believe are trying to track protesters who are actually at the reservation. what's going on at standing rock? protests have been boiling over in a long standoff with the police over the fate of an oil pipeline under construction near the standing rock sioux reservation. on friday, the police said they arrested more than 142 people and used beanbags and pepper spray to disperse the crowds. company officials say the pipeline will be a safer way to transfer oil 1,170 miles from north dakota to illinois. but activists say the construction of the pipeline will harm sacred cultural lands and local water supplies. activists call themselves water protectors and are busy raising money online that is intended to help them operate an encampment near the protest area. who started the facebook protest? it's not clear. but activist pages, including stand against dakota access pipeline no dapl, have shared some version of a message that is all over facebook: \"the morton county sheriff's department has been using facebook check-ins to find out who is at standing rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps. water protectors are calling on everyone to check in at sr to overwhelm and confuse them.\" is the check-in movement distracting law enforcement? no, according to the authorities. \"the morton county sheriff's department is not and does not follow facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location. this claim/rumor is absolutely false,\" the department wrote on its facebook page on monday. it's not unheard-of, however, for the police to rely on social media to locate and track the movements of suspects, but it looks like this particular movement was started without an understanding of how the authorities would gather data or if they were doing this at all. are there precedents for this? checking in to protests has been a favorite pastime of online observers who can't be where the protest is but want to spread the word. perhaps the most notable example is the so-called twitter revolution during protests of iran's 2009 presidential elections. people changed their twitter avatars to a green overlay and switched their locations to tehran in hopes of confusing law enforcement officials trying to track down activists and bloggers. these efforts don't always work to organize on-the-ground protests , but that's beside the point. with very little effort, online activists can use social media to bring more publicity to a cause, the latest example being the standing rock check-ins you may be seeing on your facebook feed.",

        "title": "army to use webcasts from iraq for recruiting.",
        "abstract": "for the last two years, the army has presented itself to potential recruits as the way to become \"army strong.\" beginning on tuesday, veterans day , the army will seek to make its pitch stronger by making the campaign more relevant to the desired audience of americans ages 17 to 24. one new feature on a redesigned version of the army web site ( goarmy.com ) called \"straight from iraq\" states, \"now you can find out what it's really like to be deployed in the middle east from the men and women stationed there.\" \"soldiers are ready to take your questions,\" says a section of the site devoted to a webcast series. the feature represents the first time that visitors can ask questions of soldiers deployed overseas as well as the first time the iraq war has been referred to so directly and prominently on the web site. the goal is to provide those considering the army along with parents and others who influence their decisions with \"verifiable information about what being a soldier is really like, what combat is really like,\" said lt. gen. benjamin c. freakley, commanding general of the army accessions command in fort monroe, va., which is overseeing recruitment. the changes in the \"army strong\" campaign place more emphasis on the internet, event marketing and other methods that connect with young americans on a closer, more personal level. to help pay for the new media features, cutbacks are being made in areas like the army's sponsorships of professional rodeos. the changes include an additional theme for the campaign, \"strength like no other,\" which will appear along with \"army strong\"; a focus on the skills that recruits can learn in the army, to make a stronger case about how serving can bring personal and career success later in life; and new information about becoming an officer. \"the campaign has been successful conveying the benefits of 'army strong,' the physical, emotional and mental benefits,\" said ed walters, chief marketing officer for the army at the pentagon. \"we wanted to more clearly articulate that,\" he added, through efforts like sharing with civilians the video clips of \"real soldiers' stories.\" the \"army strong\" campaign is produced by nine agencies, eight of them part of the mccann worldgroup division of the interpublic group of companies. the army ad budget from 2006 through 2011 is estimated at $1.35 billion. the army has met its recruiting goals for the first two fiscal years during which the \"army strong\" campaign has appeared. critics of the military's practices contend that bonuses being awarded to recruits as well as less stringent entry standards have also helped meet the goals. \"we love the 'army strong' campaign because it resonates with youth,\" general freakley said, and it \"says in a nutshell who our soldiers are, that it is a strength they get by serving.\" \"this is a progression, an evolution,\" he added, referring to the new phase of the campaign. in addition to the new content on goarmy.com, there will be new tv commercials, meant to help drive traffic to the web site. the first ones compare the army to a company, a team and a school by showing young men and women in settings like an office building, a gym and a campus. the scenes shift into scenes of soldiers performing military tasks like marching and saluting the flag. in the gym commercial, young athletes are seen working out, then stacking sandbags. \"there is a team like no other team in the world,\" says the narrator, the actor gary sinise, who took over the narration work for the campaign last year from the actor josh charles. \"when they raise their flag in victory, you will know what these men and women are fighting for,\" mr. sinise says, \"and you will feel fortunate to be counted among them.\" in the office commercial, young workers in business attire suddenly start climbing walls. \"this company is filled with dreamers,\" mr. sinise says, \"but they also have courage, strength and honor, and when they leave this company it will be with a thousand opportunities and the respect of millions.\" the intent is \"to show the army in a way you haven't thought about it,\" said craig markus, executive creative director at mccann erickson worldwide in new york, one of the mccann worldgroup agencies working on the campaign. \"obviously, the buzzword right now is 'relevance,' \" he added, \"and we're trying to talk to people in a way that's relevant to them at the moment.\" coincidentally, it turns out the campaign was developed months before the start of the steep economic downturn. the growing unemployment rate could benefit the army because young men and women may enlist rather than search fruitlessly for work. \"history will tell you that's true,\" mr. markus said, \"but i'm not going to predict what may happen.\" the other mccann worldgroup agencies working on the campaign are: casanova pendrill, for ads aimed at hispanics; the iw group, for ads aimed at asian-americans; momentum, for event marketing and sponsorships; mrm worldwide, for the web site, digital marketing and direct marketing; nas recruitment, for medical recruiting; universal mccann, for media planning and buying; and weber shandwick, for public relations. another agency, carol h. williams advertising, is creating ads aimed at african-american recruits. other changes the army is making include reworking the content of the virtual army experience, a traveling interactive exhibit with games and other displays that is intended for an audience as young as 13. there have been complaints that the exhibit is inappropriate because it makes combat seem to be fun. \"if we show the army fighting, people say it's violent,\" general freakley said. \"if we don't, people say it's not truthful.\" the new content for the exhibit will concentrate on the peaceful purposes the army can serve, he added, like providing humanitarian aid. the new elements of the \"army strong\" campaign aimed at so-called influencers like parents are scheduled to start in january. such ads have been part of the campaign since it began in 2006.",

        "title": "closing of carnegie deli amid con ed investigation disappoints diners.",
        "abstract": "on tuesday morning, inspectors from consolidated edison are scheduled to show new york city investigators what they brought back from the carnegie deli near central park. it is not a $30 pastrami and corned beef sandwich named after woody allen; nor is it an $8 giant knish. it is a y-shaped piece of plumbing that con edison says the restaurant, famous for its massive piles of sliced meat on rye, used to misappropriate natural gas for six years until it was abruptly shut down on friday. the curtaining of the carnegie disappointed a stream of hungry would-be customers on monday, many of them tourists who went out of their way to test their tolerance for protein. it was the second case in a month in which a manhattan deli was put out of business, at least temporarily, after utility inspectors found evidence of tampering with a gas line. the discoveries have come amid heightened fears about the hazards of gas pipes since a march 26 explosion destroyed three buildings on second avenue in the east village and killed two men. in the week after the blast, inspectors found an illegal gas hookup to the nearby stage restaurant , which closed after getting an eviction notice . image the closed carnegie, which is famous for its massive piles of sliced meat on rye. credit hiroko masuike/the new york times last week, the city's investigation department began a coordinated effort with con ed, the buildings department and the manhattan district attorney's office to locate illegal natural-gas hookups that were potentially hazardous, a law enforcement official said on monday. that effort was a reaction to the blast in the east village, which law enforcement officials have said they believe was caused by a gas leak that resulted from attempts to siphon gas intended for a ground-floor restaurant to fuel stoves and water-heaters in apartments above it. but when con edison workers found evidence of the siphoning in the building that stood at 121 second avenue in manhattan, the gas had been drawn off after being measured by the utility's meter, so there was no allegation of \"theft of service\" from the utility. at the carnegie deli, however, con edison said about half of the gas that the utility was delivering to the building was being diverted before the meter and, therefore, not showing up on the deli's bills. after determining that the diversion had lasted six years, con edison demanded that the deli pay $40,050, the estimated cost to deliver all that unmeasured gas, said bob mcgee, a spokesman for the utility. he said the deli's owner \"cut us a check on the spot.\" mr. mcgee added that the deli buys the gas that con edison delivers from a different company and would have to settle up with that company separately. image lunch at the carnegie was supposed to be a highlight of robert peter's trip to the city with his mother from their home in millbrook, n.y. \"my friend took me here when we were on a field trip,\" robert, 11, said on monday. \"and i loved it.\" credit hiroko masuike/the new york times the closing of the carnegie deli was widely reported last weekend. chris giglio, a spokesman for the owners of the deli, said: \"the current management is outraged over this situation and will do everything possible to find out exactly what happened. the carnegie deli will reopen as soon as possible, and we thank our employees and patrons for their patience and consideration.\" con edison workers stumbled onto the siphoning setup at the carnegie deli last week, after they responded to a report of a gas odor outside the restaurant. but a law enforcement official, who insisted an anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said that the follow-up investigation was an example of the more cooperative approach the utility and city officials were taking. on friday, the buildings department issued an order to halt all work on the gas pipes at 854 seventh avenue, a five-story apartment building near 55th street that houses the deli. that work, requiring a permit, would have to resume before con edison would restore gas to the deli or the apartments above it, mr. mcgee said. until then, the sidewalk outside the deli on seventh avenue is likely to continue to feature a recurring scene: a taxi pulls up; tourists, eager to attempt superhuman feats of eating, make for the door; smiles melt like swiss cheese on a reuben. image for nick athanasatos, owner of premier deli cafe on seventh avenue, the closing of carnegie deli next door represented a great pastrami opportunity. credit hiroko masuike/the new york times inside the small doorway, an employee loudly told those who wanted to double-check that the deli was, in fact, closed. anyone who stayed too long was reprimanded with the ringing of a bell. lunch at the carnegie was supposed to be a highlight of 11-year-old robert peter's trip to the city with his mother from their home in millbrook, n.y. \"my friend took me here when we were on a field trip,\" he said on monday. \"and i loved it.\" but instead of perusing a menu filled with dishes named for celebrities, some of whom were once regular customers, robert and his mother were stuck reading a message that explained that the deli was closed for repairs. over the weekend, ron mitchell, who works nearby, watched the events that led to the deli's closing unfold. on wednesday, gas trucks were there, he said, inspecting the street outside. the next two days, con ed and the fire department. by saturday, the deli was empty. \"even this morning, i've seen both regulars and tourists come up and show the same frustration,\" he said on monday. \"no one wants to see carnegie closed.\" except perhaps nick athanasatos, the owner of the premier deli cafe next door. on monday, he posted a sign on his window that read, \"special today! pastrami & corn beef, $14.95.\" on day 3 of life without the carnegie deli, he felt it was wise to advertise that he, too, offered the meats that drew so many people to the block. \"of course we've had more people today,\" mr. athanasatos said. \"carnegie's closed. but we have the best pastrami, aside from carnegie.\" he ran to the back, and held two large racks of the cured meat aloft like trophies for everyone to see. \"who needs carnegie when you have this?\" he asked.",

        "title": "fight for bed supremacy spreads to the skies.",
        "abstract": "after years of a cease-fire, the hotel bedding wars are resuming, and now airstrikes are even being called in. i've deployed ridiculously martial language there only to underscore a point about hotel bedding, which had been a mundane and boring business among old-line mattress makers until 1999, when westin hotels introduced a new mattress and bedding accessories branded as the heavenly bed, which was developed by simmons, the big mattress manufacturer. whereupon a couple of remarkable things happened that truly did constitute a big pillow fight, or even a marketing war. first, seeing the overnight (sorry) success of the heavenly bed, other hotel companies rushed to develop their own branded high-end bedding, whether made by simmons or by competitors like serta or sealy, which markets hotel-branded bedding through its global hospitality collection, and others. as hotel companies began buying luxury beds for their properties and selling them through their own catalogs and online sites, the overall retail bedding industry underwent a revolution. travelers, and especially a new wave of female business travelers after 1999, came home and decided that their own beds simply didn't measure up to the ones they were finding in hotels. after the heavenly bed introduction, hotels in every top category \"understood that they couldn't have a bed in the room that was crummier than the one the customer had at home,\" said steve tipton, the vice president of simmons hospitality, the mattress company's hotel unit. at the same time, hotel-branded mattresses started to be sold in retail outlets like department stores, and high-end mattresses and other bedding in general had become such a market standard that overall sales soared, to about $6.8 billion last year. \"the consumer connection between the bed and the hotel is a big deal\" in the overall mattress business, mr. tipton said. image credit chi birmingham by 2006, when one hotel company, hilton, had already invested $1 billion in new bedding since 1999, the hotel mattress race subsided. but now it's back on. as hotels recover from the recession and begin investing again in improvements, simmons recently introduced a line of hotel bedding called recharge beautyrest, positioned to sell upgraded bedding featuring foams that regulate mattress temperature. and even some airlines are now heralding the virtues of high-end mattresses and bedding in international first-class and business-class cabins, where lie-flat beds have become the industry standard. for example, delta air lines recently began promoting a new \"westin heavenly in-flight bedding product\" for its businesselite cabins on international flights and on domestic flights between kennedy airport in new york and los angeles, san francisco and seattle, as well as between atlanta and honolulu. singapore airlines advertises private suites featuring luxurious double beds in first-class cabins of its a380s, and lufthansa technik, the maintenance and upgrade unit of the big german airline, is marketing its own flexidreamer bed (\"for a heavenly sleep\"), first developed for luxury private jets and now available for first-class cabins on commercial airplanes. while such sumptuous comforts are most definitely not available in the airlines' increasingly cramped and austere coach cabins, the evolution of luxury bedding into premium cabins on commercial planes reflects what the hotel business learned well over the last 23 years. as delta's announcement of the new high-end bedding for its businesselite cabins put it, \"in recent surveys, customers have told us that the most important part of the in-flight experience is sleep.\" in the hotel business, a good night's sleep on high-quality bedding is increasingly a top marketing point. for example, crowne plaza hotels, a brand of the ihg hotel group, is emphasizing bedding improvements as part of its multiyear initiative to refurbish quality standards at its hotels in nearly 60 countries. incidentally, one of the most interesting aspects of the whole hotel bed-wars phenomenon to me has been the impact on the home-bedding market. for most people, buying a home mattress was always an unpleasant chore, \"right up there with used cars,\" said mr. tipton at simmons. but hotels in effect became real-time showrooms for mattresses. no more plopping down uneasily on a mattress at a department store in a futile attempt to try it out. at a hotel, you use the mattress the way you'd use one at home. then you can purchase that bedding from the hotel company, or from a retail store that sells lines of mattresses branded with whichever hotel they are found in. \"it really takes a lot of the unpleasantness out of trying a mattress out,\" mr. tipton said.",

        "abstract": "albany, feb. 6 - the state's chief judge, judith s. kaye, called on monday for broad changes in how the state elects its judges, in an effort to give the public more control of the process. \"it is no understatement that public confidence in the judicial branch is at stake,\" she said in her annual state of the judiciary address, adding that the deficiencies in the current system \"must be dealt with by our legislature.\" her proposals were based on a new report on judicial selection by a special commission led by john d. feerick, a professor and former dean of the fordham university school of law. the findings were particularly timely because last month, a federal judge, citing the undue control of party leaders over the process, ruled that new york's system of electing judges was unconstitutional. mr. feerick's report opposed the notion of having direct primaries for judges, unless public funds were made available for candidates. instead, the report suggested a number of changes to the current system of special judicial nominating conventions, including new procedures for selecting delegates as well as reducing the number of signatures required by nominees. judge kaye said she believed the recommendations would satisfy the call from the federal court for a reform of the judicial selection process. judge kaye also called for the state to assume oversight and management of public defenders around the state, saying that the current system of letting localities pay and oversee court-appointed lawyers had failed badly. and, with state judges not having had a pay increase in seven years, she renewed her perennial call for higher judicial pay. this year, perhaps to bolster support, she called for raises in all three branches of government, proposing a new system by which judges, legislators and members of the executive branch would receive annual cost-of-living adjustments.",

        "abstract": "london for thierry henry , it must seem like his youth passing before him. on leave from the new york red bulls, where he is seeing out the last of his playing time, henry is back at his first love, arsenal . he trains there to stay healthy during the break in the american season. he watches from the stands, nattily dressed in tartan, applauding theo walcott, a player hoping to evolve into king henry ii for the london team. the resemblance is growing. when thierry h. was in his pomp, wearing the red shirt with the white no.14, he displayed almost feline speed of movement with impeccable ball skills. he was a winger turned into a predator of marvelous goals. when the time was ripe, after henry turned 23 years old, the coach, arsene wenger, encouraged the shy young man to drift in from the wings to terrorize defenders in central positions. the rest is history: 228 goals scored over the span of eight seasons for arsenal. goals of stealth, imagination, technique and, above all, of astonishing speed that defenders could not live with. on the last saturday of 2012, walcott, the apprentice wearing no.14, scored a hat trick. each of his goals was spectacular, and each different. for the first, he darted in from the left, saw where newcastle united's goalie, tim krul, was positioned, and stroked the ball around the keeper with precision that took it a fraction inside the base of the far post. but this was a contest typical of christmas week in england. results of 4-3 were commonplace. manchester united won by that score, against poor newcastle, last wednesday. manchester city won by that amount at norwich on saturday. aston villa, a team of callow youth and inexperience, had a harrowing week, losing 8-0 at chelsea, 4-0 at home to tottenham hotspur, and 3-0 to wigan athletic. the problem is compounded by the glut of fixtures, the time spent on the road and the lack of coaching time in between. if there is a fault line or a crises of confidence, the coach is powerless to work it through. in newcastle's case, the manager alan pardew faced successive games on a sapping field at manchester united and a pristine field at arsenal, both entailing hour upon hour of bus travel and overnight hotel stops. pardew's team, on a run of 8 losses in 10 games, arrived already weakened, by injuries to defenders. attack was attempted remedy. to score three at manchester, and three at arsenal, yet lose, was vainglorious. arsenal proved even worse because, after three times coming from a goal down to equalize, newcastle eventually ran out of steam and was thrashed 7-3 the most devastating score in almost 120 years of these two clubs facing each another. \"it was manic,\" walcott said at the end. \"the game was so open, and that played into our hands.\" indeed so. arsenal's strength is the counterattack, and with newcastle's back line so stretched, this was a game tailor-made for such tactics. the best of the 10 goals was walcott's third. he advanced from the left. he jinked, he danced, he dodged between three defenders, stretching their sinews and their minds. one of them bundled him over, and it would have been a penalty had walcott stayed down. but he got up from his knees more quickly than the referee might blow his whistle, and, in the blink of an eye, walcott flicked the ball over the advancing goalkeeper. a magic goal, conjured out of thin air. an henry-esque goal by a player who has been asking to play central striker for more than a year. the news media, full these days of former players or failed coaches, have been criticizing arsenal and wenger throughout this season for not giving walcott free rein. the chorus of experts is that arsenal either lets walcott play where he pleases, or he will become the latest arsenal player to find a club that will give him that freedom. the memory of cesc fabregas, samir nasri, robin van persie and others leaving arsenal in their prime has damaged wenger's team-building and arsenal's credibility year after year. walcott is the last of a coterie of coveted young englishmen whom arsenal must either sign on new, extended contracts or lose. \"sign him up! sign him up!\" bayed the crowd after the game saturday, as walcott took a lap of honor, holding the match ball that a hat-trick hero gets to keep. \"we are working on it\" is the message that both wenger and walcott give when they are pressed, at virtually every postgame interview, to say when or if a new deal will be signed. the clock is ticking, because walcott's current contract expires at the end of this season. central to the discussion is not simply money, though arsenal is more parsimonious with its cash than, say, chelsea, the manchesters, or even tottenham and liverpool. the crux is that walcott keeps expressing the desire to step into a central role, now that henry has gone stateside and van persie has moved to manchester united. all in good time, is wenger's response. \"thierry was 23 when i decided to move him to the middle,\" wenger says, smiling at his inquisitors. \"i like the signs that i see with theo. he is, you know, 23. it is an interesting challenge that i think he can take on.\" \"on the wing, you need a shorter technique, whereas through the middle you have to learn a lot, to go right or go left. i always said theo would one day play through the middle, and it grew in his brain.\" it will not be lost on wenger that walcott's finest moment on saturday was a toss-up between his final goal, and a classic piece of wing play when he cut in from the right and curled in a fabulous cross for olivier giroud, a classic center forward, to head another for arsenal. the studio couch experts think they know better. but the coach, working daily with his players, probably knows best. \"i think he loves the club and the club loves him,\" wenger said after the game, \"and the reciprocity in love is the most difficult to find. \"theo has learned a lot because he is an intelligent player. and because he is intelligent, he will continue to improve,\" wenger continued. \"you know the intensity of my desire is exactly the same as it was before the game. my desire is to extend his contract, he belongs here and hopefully we can do it.\"",

        "abstract": "warning that the fate of new york city education was \"hanging in the balance,\" dennis m. walcott, the schools chancellor, suggested on saturday that the school system was at risk of falling into disarray in the hands of a new mayor. mr. walcott, in his latest salvo against the democrats running for mayor, said city schools had reached a \"new day\" and that efforts to chip away at mayor michael r. bloomberg's 11-year reform effort were misguided. \"halting the momentum of this extraordinary transformation would be a tragedy,\" mr. walcott told an audience of more than 1,100 school administrators gathered for a conference at brooklyn technical high school. the democratic candidates for mayor have promised to reverse some of mr. bloomberg's signature policies, including closing low-performing schools and providing space to charter schools. those promises have caused distress in city hall, though the republican candidates have generally embraced the approach of mr. bloomberg, who leaves office at the end of the year. mr. walcott's speech seemed intended to be a rallying cry before a friendly crowd, but the response was muted. while his calls for preserving the authority of principals and eradicating nepotism were met with applause, some principals seemed uninterested in his message. laughter broke out in some corners after mr. walcott explained that he was not looking to be a kingmaker. \"i don't like to involve myself in politics,\" he said. renel piton, the principal of brooklyn lab school, said he shared mr. walcott's concern about the candidates for mayor and did not want them to \"gut reform for the sake of gutting.\" still, he said he was surprised the chancellor chose to use a speech at an academic conference to weigh in on a political battle. image dennis m. walcott, the schools chancellor, spoke at a conference on saturday. credit michael appleton for the new york times \"we need to focus on what's going on in schools,\" mr. piton said. \"i don't come on a saturday to listen to their views on the candidates.\" brian devale, principal of public school 257 in brooklyn, applauded when mr. walcott began discussing the old way of running schools, before the state legislature handed the mayor authority over the school system in 2002. mr. devale, an opponent of mayoral control, said he thought mr. bloomberg and mr. walcott were too authoritarian in their approach. \"i sat and listened to a political lecture from an administration i have no interest in,\" mr. devale, who is a union representative, said after the speech. john c. liu, the city comptroller and a democratic contender for mayor, said he was puzzled by mr. walcott's suggestion that the candidates were pandering to the teachers' union. \"candidates respond to complaints and concerns about the status quo,\" mr. liu said in a telephone interview. \"candidates don't manufacture concern.\" even the department of education's chief academic officer, shael polakow-suransky, waded into the political fray, urging principals to support efforts to overhaul the school system. mr. polakow-suransky said he was so distraught by the attacks on the campaign trail that he called the chancellor of the washington school system, kaya henderson, for advice. in response, according to mr. polakow-suransky, ms. henderson offered a variation on an african proverb: \"the elephants are going to be fighting, but don't forget to tend the grass.\"",

        "abstract": "shanghai, june 4 china's stock markets tumbled again on monday, worsening one of the biggest sell-offs in years after the government's move last week to impose a higher tax on stock trades. there was little effect on markets outside china. shares in tokyo and hong kong closed up. stock prices in europe were modestly lower and in new york a little higher. but in china, stocks have fallen by a total of about 15 percent in the four sessions since the government announced last wednesday that it would triple the stock-trading stamp tax, to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent. monday's drop of 8.3 percent in the benchmark index, raised the fear of a wave of panic selling in china's financial markets after an extraordinary bull run in which share prices have climbed by more than 300 percent in the last two years. indeed, after the authorities in beijing announced the new transaction fees last week, they have grown increasingly concerned that investors may become too pessimistic. and so front-page editorials were published in chinese financial newspapers calling on investors to act calmly in the wake of the decision, which the editorials argued was intended to promote a healthier development of the stock market. \"investors should be rational and understand the policy,\" the china securities journal, one of the government-guided papers, said in its editorial. but markets, as the chinese are discovering, are not always rational. indeed, for months officials have been warning investors about the risks of a sharp downturn, trying to calm the markets with official statements. so far, the downturns have been brief. but the most recent trajectories of the country's two main stock markets have been unsettling. on monday, the shanghai stock exchange index plunged 330.34 points, to close at 3,670.40. the other major index, for the shenzhen exchange, fell 7.9 percent, to 1,039.90. [the sell-off continued tuesday morning with shares in shanghai down almost 6 percent just before midday.] monday's decline, after notable drops two of three days last week, represented one of the largest share price declines in more than a decade and was nearly comparable to the drop late in february, when the shanghai composite lost 8.8 percent on a single day. that plunge, which came after a huge run-up in prices, touched off a wave of selling around the world, including new york. the biggest concern this time seems to be how the gyrating stock market may affect ordinary chinese. for much of this year, the stock market has been a great concern for the government because of reports that retirees, students and factory workers were plowing much of their savings into stocks, threatening to create a speculative bubble that could end in a damaging and politically explosive crash. many experts have been warning that stock prices are rising much too fast and that stock valuations are far above historical or global norms. analysts say the government wants to cool the market, but hopes to do so in an orderly way. \"this is somewhat expected,\" said frank song, director of the center for china financial research at the university of hong kong. \"last week's policy change is a strong signal that the government will no longer tolerate this rising bubble.\" but many individual investors have been betting on the market's reaching ever new highs because of an influx of just-opened stock accounts, often as many as 400,000 on a single day. a lot of chinese have indicated belief that the government would not do anything drastic to shake up the stock market before 2008, when beijing is to play host at the summer olympics, out of a fear that a plunge could lead to public protests and even social unrest. just before the finance ministry's announcement on the trading tax early last wednesday, officials said there were no plans to increase it. but then they reversed course. shares tumbled 6.5 percent on wednesday, then bounced back slightly on thursday before falling again friday. the reopening of the market after the weekend was a kind of black monday here, with a further downturn in prices that reversed weeks of huge gains. few analysts are forecasting a full-scale bear market, but many experts have been warning of more government measures and the end of the boom. and there are fears among both government officials and private analysts that a severe downturn in prices can lead to a further rout that would wreak havoc with the finances of ordinary chinese. indeed, when the government imposed higher transaction fees on stock trades, investors vented their anger online, and there were reports that several government web sites, including a finance ministry site, had been hacked into and taken down for a time.",

        "abstract": "the yankees called the agent for pitcher cliff lee shortly after free agency began at 12:01 a.m. sunday, telling the agent that signing lee was one of their top priorities this off-season, an official in baseball briefed on the matter said. the conversation was considered the team's first step in trying to sign lee, a 32-year-old left-hander, and the yankees did not make a formal offer, the official said. the official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his access to such information. although members of the texas rangers' front office have been outspoken about how hard they will fight to re-sign lee, the rangers do not have the deep pockets of the yankees, who once again appear willing to pay a premium for one of the top pitchers in baseball. working to the yankees' advantage is that lee is a close friend of their ace, c. c. sabathia. the two played together for the cleveland indians. and lee is represented by darek braunecker, the agent for yankees pitcher a. j. burnett. but lee's wife, kristen, told usa today that she was upset by the behavior of fans at yankee stadium during the american league championship series. the beginning of free agency also means that the veterans derek jeter and mariano rivera are free to talk to other teams, although they seem likely to re-sign. the yankees will probably talk to the agents for jeter and rivera this week about new contracts.",

        "abstract": "tokyo japan 's economy rebounded in the latest quarter for the first time in a year, signaling the possible end of the country's deepest recession since world war ii and brightening prospects for a widespread global recovery. japan's economy, the world's second-largest, plunged into recession in the wake of the global financial crisis last year. exports, its mainstay, at one point fell to half their precrisis levels. but a turnaround in exports and a vast fiscal stimulus program helped produce a 0.9 percent economic expansion in the three months that ended june 30, government figures showed on monday, equivalent to annualized growth of 3.7 percent. the expansion was in line with the 0.9 percent growth forecast that was the average of 10 economists surveyed last week. a 1.2 percent growth in public demand helped offset a 1.3 percent fall in demand from the private sector, the data showed. overall domestic demand fell 0.7 percent from the previous quarter. \"the results were very positive,\" said takuji aida, senior economist at ubs securities japan. \"it's true japan would not have achieved growth without government stimulus. still, the data shows that inventory adjustment is all but over, and we can expect growth going forward.\" the japanese economy's resurgence after four consecutive quarters of contraction including an 11.7 percent fall in annualized terms in the previous quarter adds to a slowly improving picture of the world economy. (the growth rate for the previous quarter was revised upward monday from 14.2 percent.) last week, the german and french economies showed unexpected growth. the federal reserve said last week that the united states, the world's biggest economy, appeared to be \"leveling out.\" china, hong kong, singapore and south korea have reported rebounds as the effects of stimulus efforts across the globe take effect. recovery in these critical overseas markets whittled down inventories and released some pent-up demand, bolstering japan's exports of cars and electronics. exports grew 6.3 percent from the previous quarter, while imports fell 5.1 percent. at home, new tax breaks and incentives to help sales of energy-efficient cars and household appliances, coupled with lower gas prices and a rebound in share prices, spurred consumer spending. prime minister taro aso has pledged 25 trillion yen (about $263 billion) in stimulus money, including a cash handout plan and more public spending on programs like quake-proofing the country's public schools, to revive the economy. investors have shown recent optimism in japan's economy; shares in tokyo recently rallied to their highest levels since early october. but the nikkei 225 average dipped 1.5 percent in early trading monday after the numbers were announced, after weak consumer sentiment data in the united states sent wall street lower on friday. still, the outlook for japan remains unclear, and some analysts question whether the economy can sustain this recovery after stimulus measures at home and elsewhere run their course. falling employment and wages are also expected to weigh on consumer spending for some time. japan's jobless rate hit a six-year high of 5.4 percent, and wages showed a record drop in june on an annual basis, dragging down consumer spending. weak demand, coupled with falling oil prices, have put downward pressure on prices here, raising fears of prolonged and damaging deflation . \"with the factors driving the current rebound being temporary in nature, a self-sustaining recovery is still not in sight,\" ryutaro kono, tokyo-based economist for bnp paribas, told clients in a report published before monday's numbers. the latest growth recoups only a small fraction of the 8.8 percent the japanese economy has lost since peaking in early 2008, mr. kono said. private capital investment and real estate values also remain weak, economists say. although production activity has increased with the turnaround in exports, \"we have yet to see 'active production' backed by capital investment,\" kyohei morita, chief economist for japan at barclays capital, wrote in a note. though exports and industrial production are recovering, their levels remain well off their peak, saddling companies with excess capacity and employment, mr. morita said. the bank of japan struck a similarly cautious note over prospects for a sustained recovery in a recent report. while the bank said the japanese economy had stopped deteriorating, it warned that employment and wages would stay low for some time, hurting consumer spending. despite this quarter's growth, the bank predicts that japan's economy will contract 3.4 percent in the year to march 2010. the latest uptick is unlikely to enhance the standing of mr. aso's liberal democratic party ahead of national elections this month, when many expect the party to lose its grip on power for only the second time in over half a century. voter surveys show that the democratic party, japan's main opposition party, which vows to put more money in the hands of consumers, is favored to beat the liberal democrats in the aug. 30 balloting. support has soared for the democrats and their ambitious election platform, which includes cash allowances to families with children, free tuition and lower gasoline taxes. but some economists warn the democrats' plans will add to japan's growing debt, which already surpasses 180 percent of its gross domestic product. others say that japan needs deeper structural reforms to raise productivity, especially in the face of a shrinking population. an overhaul of the tax and social insurance systems are also priorities for japan. unless japan can maintain robust growth into next year, the country will have suffered another \"lost decade\" of economic growth, after limping through much of the 1990s with little growth, yutaka harada, chief economist at the daiwa institute of research, wrote in a recent note. \"ten years after our lost decade, we're finding ourselves in the midst of a second lost decade,\" mr. harada said.",

        "abstract": "colombo, sri lanka to many americans, maya arulpragasam , known as m.i.a., is the very pregnant rapper who gyrated across the stage at sunday's grammy awards. yet in sri lanka, where she spent her childhood years, m.i.a. remains virtually unknown. and some who do know her work say she is an apologist for the separatist tamil tiger rebels fighting in the country's long-running civil war. m.i.a. who has been nominated for an oscar for the song she co-wrote for the hit film \"slumdog millionaire\" has branded herself through music videos and interviews as the voice of the country's tamil minority. in the video for her song \" bird flu ,\" for instance, children dance in front of what looks like the rebels' logo: a roaring tiger. \"being the only tamil in the western media, i have a really great opportunity to sort of bring forward what's going on in sri lanka,\" she said in an interview on the pbs program \"tavis smiley\" last month. \"there's a genocide going on.\" but her political views rankle some people at a time when most sri lankans are clutching to the hope that the rebels, branded by the united states and european nations as a terrorist group, are on the verge of military defeat by government troops. \"frankly, she's very lucky to get away with supporting, even indirectly, perhaps the most ruthless terrorist outfit in the world,\" said suresh jayawickrama, a songwriter based in colombo. mr. jayawickrama is from the country's majority sinhalese ethnic group, and his reaction is similar to that of many sri lankans who know m.i.a.'s music. but he also said that m.i.a. deserved credit for her artistry and the fame she had achieved. \"she really should have a little more recognition in this country,\" he said. despite decades of conflict, music has remained largely free of political messages or overtones in sri lanka, perhaps because audiences are seeking entertainment and escape from the daily reminders of civil war. \"compared to other countries, people don't write many songs here about what is going on politically,\" said dillain joseph, a singer who is of mixed sinhalese and tamil parentage. meanwhile, m.i.a.'s claims that the government is carrying out a genocide against tamils place her on the outer fringe of opinion about the conflict. although the government has brutalized and killed tamil civilians over the past 25 years, human rights organizations spread the blame around, estimating that 70,000 people on both sides have been killed in the fighting. \"this is a conflict in which both sides have terrible human rights records,\" said yolanda foster, a specialist on sri lanka with amnesty international in london . \"the tamil tigers have a long history of child recruitment, hostage taking, forcing civilians to the front lines. it's complicated to assign blame.\" m.i.a. was born in britain but moved to sri lanka when she was 6 months old so that her father, an engineer and a leader in the tamil separatist movement, could help fight for an independent tamil homeland. her childhood took her across northern sri lanka, wracked by insurgency, to india and back to britain, where her mother and siblings settled into a public housing project outside london. her father remained in sri lanka. she now calls new york home. sri lankans who have seen her videos say they interpret some parts as showing support for the tigers, or at the very least glorifying their cause. but for those not familiar with the conflict, they might come across as generic third-world scenes. \"i kind of want to leave it ambiguous for my fans,\" she said in the pbs interview, referring to the lyrics of her song \"paper planes,\" which was nominated for record of the year at the grammys but did not win. \"paper planes,\" which compares international drug dealing with selling records, drew a reaction from delon, a sinhalese rapper based in los angeles , who made a video remix in which he interspersed images of people being blown up by tamil tiger bombs and subtitles about m.i.a. being a terrorist. m.i.a. responded that she did not support terrorism. despite those tensions, which played out largely on the internet and abroad, musicians in sri lanka say the music scene has remained ethnically diverse, with members of the country's numerous ethnic groups and religions often forming bands together. \"there's a lot of mixing and matching going on,\" said rienzie pereira, a guitar player. \"it's basically like sports. no matter what ethnic group you are from, people can play cricket together.\"",

        "abstract": "with 49 deaths in 29 years, the annual dakar rally off-road race has been panned by the vatican newspaper as \"the bloody race of irresponsibility.\" but each year, ronn h. bailey is drawn to it nonetheless. bailey, the founder and chairman of a software security firm based in las vegas that protects sensitive corporate and government computer systems, willingly puts himself at risk to compete in the race. \"statistically and factually speaking, the dakar is the longest, the toughest, the most grueling and, no question about it, the most dangerous race in the world,\" bailey said in a recent telephone interview. \"it is the only race that i know of that has a human mortality rate associated with it. so yes, it's very dangerous. but you know, i don't live in fear.\" instead, he lives in hope that he will hold his own among the 570 teams, which include many professional drivers. the race will begin jan. 5 in lisbon and cover more than 5,700 miles, over sometimes treacherous terrain. the route winds down the western coast of africa, with competitors finishing jan. 20 in dakar, the capital of senegal. bailey expects to be there in the end. his company, vanguard integrity professionals, counts united states government agencies and banks around the world among its clients. the firm has poured millions of sponsorship dollars into helping the nascar driver robby gordon attempt to become the first american to win the dakar rally. in return, bailey, who has competed on his own the past three years, will race as gordon's teammate. both drivers and their navigators will race in equally prepared hummers. \"he has a passion,\" gordon said in a telephone interview. \"i think all of us want to show testosterone at times, right? and i think ronn is no different than every successful male that has done well. if it's offshore powerboat racing, or if it's off-road racing, or owning a nascar team, or whatever it may be. successful businessmen love motorsports as well. \"i think it's just cool that he likes it this much and that he wants to participate at the level that we're wanting to participate.\" the goals are different, of course. gordon is a professional driver who competes for his own nascar team, robby gordon motorsports; he finished 26th in the nextel cup points standings this year. he is also an accomplished off-road racer, and has won the baja 1000 in mexico three times. gordon finished eighth in last year's dakar rally, and he has a 40-man team at his off-road race shop in anaheim, calif., preparing for this year's event. he is even skipping a critical nascar test at daytona international speedway to make another run at the dakar rally. \"our car is quite a bit better than it was a year ago,\" he said. \"so i feel very confident in the vehicles. i think we have a legitimate shot at winning this thing.\" for bailey, who fancies himself an adventurer in the mold of sir richard branson, simply finishing would be a first. he has raced the dakar rally three times but has failed to complete it on time. he is certainly not alone. many competitors are unable to make it through the event, with the sahara doubling as a junkyard of destroyed vehicles. in his first attempt at the race, bailey got lost for three days in a sandstorm in mauritania in the 2005 dakar rally. last year, he said, he survived a spectacular crash in which his buggy flipped over and was nearly destroyed. the event's death toll includes 24 drivers, along with some bystanders and children. even the race's founder and organizer, thierry sabine of france, died when his helicopter crashed in a sandstorm during the 1986 rally. none of this dissuades bailey, who said he was involved in military intelligence in the air force in the 1970s. he said that once, for kicks, he rode his motorcycle to the northernmost land mass in the arctic circle. on another vacation, he rode from the united states to the darien gap in panama and back. \"you know, i don't really think i'm any different than guys like branson,\" bailey said. \"there's a lot of men and, by the way, women, who do these things. and while, statistically, they're very dangerous this isn't the kind of thing people should practice at home kind of stuff there's a lot of people that do these things.\" bailey, 58, said he believed he would be the oldest driver in the dakar rally, but he figures to be among the more competitive ones. gordon has been giving him driving lessons. \"he's taught me some really good technical skills for driving even better off-road,\" bailey said. \"everyone who's in the dakar that are racing against me, they're going to be not necessarily looking in the rear-view mirror at me this year. they will be perhaps looking in my dust cloud.\" but if gordon has taught bailey anything, it is to take it easy and make sure to reach the finish in one piece. \"the gas pedal isn't a switch; you can slow down,\" gordon said. \"nobody says you have to go crazy every day. so it's going to be important for me, and ronn, to use our heads and survive the thing. if ronn survives, there's no reason why he can't finish in the top 10 in the vehicle we built him.\" and in the dakar rally, it is all about survival.",

        "title": "mortgage rates creep back up and crimp affordability.",
        "abstract": "if you are a prospective home buyer waiting for the bottom of the housing market, there is another fact you need to take into account: mortgage rates are rising. rates on a 30-year fixed-rate loan, which were as low as 5.89 percent in mid-april, have been climbing and now remain near a one-year high of about 6.7 percent, according to the financial publisher hsh associates. the financial troubles at fannie mae and freddie mac, the nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, are one factor behind the increasing rates. the two companies continue to reduce the number of mortgages they buy from lenders and have also imposed new fees on the loans they do buy and guarantee, a cost that ultimately is passed on to borrowers. at the same time, mortgage bond investors want to be paid more to make up for the risk that borrowers may default on their loans. so the question is whether higher mortgage rates will offset slumping home prices, and crimp buyers' purchasing power. or, to put it another way, is it better to jump into the market now before it hits bottom? the answer depends on where you live. in some parts of the country where prices may fall much further, it could pay to hold off even if mortgage rates do continue to rise. but in places where houses no longer look so overvalued, like san francisco, it may be tempting to start testing the waters. \"you might find more desperate sellers because rates have gone up,\" said keith t. gumbinger, vice president of hsh associates in pompton plains, n.j. \"when rates go up and that impacts affordability, it tends to pressure prices downward even further.\" economists at moody's economy.com expect the average 30-year fixed rate to increase to 7.01 percent by the end of next june and home prices over all to drop about 9 percent more over the same period. if everything follows their model, the economists say property values should bottom out by mid-2009. using those projections, celia chen, director of housing economics at economy.com, did some calculations on the impact of rising interest rates on a potential home buyer's budget. take, for instance, a couple who buy a $500,000 home and make a down payment of 20 percent, or $100,000. with a 6.43 percent interest rate on a 30-year fixed loan, their monthly payment would be $2,510. over the 30-year life of the mortgage, they would pay a total of about $1 million for the home, including the down payment. but what if that couple had waited and the home price dropped 9 percent to $455,000 but mortgage rates rose to 7.01 percent? now, the 20 percent down payment would be $91,000, and the monthly payments $2,424. the buyers would end up paying a total of about $964,000 for the house, or nearly 4 percent less. if the buyers were able to refinance to a lower rate a few years later, the total cost could be even lower. the calculations change, however, when mortgage rates go even higher. once the rates move above 7.36 percent, they begin to lose the benefits of the 9 percent drop in the house price. if you are looking for an apartment in manhattan, where prices are near their highs and are not expected to fall as much has they have elsewhere, the rise in mortgage rates quickly starts to affect how much you can afford. a $500,000 apartment (which could be a studio, since this is manhattan we're talking about) with a $100,000 down payment at a 7.01 percent rate means your monthly payments would be nearly $2,664. the total cost of the property, including down payment, would be $1.06 million. \"prices have come down quite a bit since the top of the market, and home values are better than they were a year ago,\" ms. chen said. \"but i am still cautioning to wait and see how much further prices will fall, particularly in regions that were most overblown during the housing boom. if you're looking for bargain basement prices, i don't think we're there yet.\" mortgage rates, on the other hand, may be even less predictable. for all we know, \"they might go down next week or the week after,\" she added. \"in the longer term, rates are still relatively attractive to where we think they might be next year.\" that is why it may be wise for homeowners looking to refinance out of, say, an adjustable-rate mortgage, to lock in a rate now. if your house drops in value, and rates continue to balloon, you may be out of luck. \"there is a real risk to sitting back in hopes that mortgage rates decline to make for a more attractive refinancing,\" said greg mcbride, senior financial analyst at bankrate.com , a personal finance web site based in north palm beach, fla. \"you could win the battle but lose the war if a further decline in your home price keeps you from qualifying.\" there is one more thing to keep in mind as you shop around for mortgages. lenders are demanding ever-higher credit scores to qualify for the best price on loans. mr. mcbride said credit scores, also known as fico scores, which are calculated by the company fair isaac, now need to be at least 720 to secure the best mortgage rates. \"nine months ago, 680 was the line of demarcation,\" mr. mcbride said. \"now, you can get a loan at 680, but the rate will be higher.\" the difference could be a quarter to a half of a percentage point more than someone with a 720. \"even though mortgage money is somewhat more expensive and loan availability continues to be impaired, if you have a good credit score, a down payment, are able to document your income, and assets and debts aren't too out of line with your income, the mortgage market is still open to you,\" mr. gumbinger of hsh said. \"but the price of that credit is somewhat less acceptable.\"",

        "abstract": "can we win? that is the biggest question really the only question americans are asking about the united states team that begins play in the women's world cup this week. rest assured, those same words are also swirling in the heads of the players. the united states won two of the first three women's world cups in 1991 and 1999 but has not won since. that drought is a delicate topic among the current players, and they are looking to put it to rest once and for all. but can they win? in 1991, the first women's world cup, no one asked me that question. frankly, i never asked it of myself either. i knew the answer. i saw it. i felt it. i lived it. in my mind, it was already done. how did i know? i just did. i knew we'd win, just as i knew i'd wake up in the morning with curly hair. it just wasn't a question. the feeling was the same for the 1996 olympic games and again for the 1999 world cup. no doubt. not for a moment. the 1995 world cup, on the other hand, was different. we prepared to win just as we had for the others, and the core of the team was much the same, but there was something missing. that absent force, whatever it was, never showed up, and although we fought hard, we lost to norway in the semifinals. the only way i can describe the difference in that ending is that something was missing. i picture it as two rivers running along side by side. the current is swift and strong. the river is wide and endless. one river welcomes you; you enter it without trying and you ride it without effort, like bodysurfing a massive wave in the ocean. it carries you and nothing is impossible. even your opponent seems to yield to the will of the river. the other river is just as powerful, but it is filled with boulders, rough water, undercurrents and jagged shorelines. it causes you to struggle and fight as you try to navigate downstream. you give all you have, but nothing you do changes the outcome. in the end, you do not have what it takes to win. before every one of my world cups, i always told interviewers that we would win. whether people believed me or not, i'm not sure. and i'm not sure if my teammates felt the same way, either, or if i was alone in my river of destiny. but i just knew. this year, in this world cup, the question of \"knowing\" can be answered only by the team and the players themselves. do they know? i have watched them play. i have read articles and listened to their interviews. but from the outside, it's difficult to make a prediction. can the united states win? absolutely. the team has the talent, including some of the best players in the world at their positions: hope solo in goal, carli lloyd in the center of the midfield and abby wambach and alex morgan up front. it is deep coming off the bench, and there is experience and leadership in both the attack and defense. not to mention fitness, speed and muscle that can be matched by only a few other teams. (the united states also has won before, which will be an edge against teams new to the mix.) on paper, those are the ingredients of a trophy-winning mix. on the other hand, this team is still soft in critical areas. namely, the defense isn't tight enough in the penalty area, allowing too many opportunities for opponents to score; and even though some recent opponents haven't capitalized, the good ones will. the team's defending must also be better and more punishing. i haven't seen many crunching tackles or messages sent to opponents to not dare enter the united states' half of the field. the midfield needs to better control the pace and variety in the attack, too, and to transition quicker into a more balanced defensive shape through the middle when it doesn't have the ball. and i die a thousand deaths each time a united states player doesn't shoot on frame or doesn't finish a chance that needs to be put away. so the question remains: can we win? that is the beauty of any united states women's national team. no matter how it may seem from the outside, it can never, ever be counted out. it has the ingredients. the only thing left is what only the team can know, and that will be revealed 90 minutes at a time. first against australia. then sweden. then nigeria. and so on. each game will provide the answer to our question, maybe in storybook fashion. i can't wait to see the last page.",

        "abstract": "franklin and eleanor roosevelt 's hyde park home may get more press, but their double townhouse on east 65th street was the scene of quite a lot of family drama in its own right. in 1905, franklin's mother, sara delano roosevelt, gave the joined houses to her only child, franklin, and his distant cousin and new wife, eleanor, for christmas. the recently widowed sara roosevelt continued to live at the neo-georgian-style edifice at no. 47 while the couple moved into the adjacent no. 49. mrs. roosevelt senior also asked the buildings' architect, charles e. platt, to add several doors for easy access into the future president and first lady's marital confines. at one point eleanor chose to arrange furniture right in front of one of the offending entrances so as to block the door, and toward the end of her life she wrote of this intrusive setup, \"you were never quite sure when she would appear, day or night.\" in 1942, a year after sara's death at the age of 86, the president sold the property to hunter college for the charitable sum of $50,000 (the four-year renovations, ending in 2010, cost $24 million). now the roosevelt house public policy institute at hunter college occupies the structures, with the f.d.r. library on the second floor used for exhibitions from the institute's collection of family ephemera (of note: franklin's desk; original posters of norman rockwell's famed four freedoms illustrations based on the 32nd president's famous speech of the same name; an original document of politicians urging roosevelt to run again in 1936). in the archives is a small, leather-bound photo album accompanied by a note written on white house stationery, dated march 17, 1942, that reads: \"dear jimmy: i found an old album at hyde park belonging to sis and as it had pictures of all of you when you were younger, i thought each one would like to have a copy. i had it photostatted and am sending it under separate cover. affectionately, fdr.\" \"jimmy\" was the commander in chief's eldest son, james roosevelt, and the \"sis\" who had originally collected the images was his daughter, anna. its 244 images (from around 1916 to 1920) include such diverse subjects as family vacations, action shots of the family german shepherd, and roosevelt's failed 1920 campaign when he ran for vice president under the democratic presidential nominee, james m. cox. there are lots of photos taken during summer vacations at hyde park with all five of the roosevelt siblings running about in various degrees of ruddy-faced tomfoolery. anna's handwritten captions (she was about 14 when the photos were taken) are particularly eye-opening. image the reverse of a mug made at prohibition's end said: \"happy days are here again.\" credit fred r. conrad for the new york times anna (who eventually worked as a human-rights activist under president kennedy, and died of throat cancer in 1975) wrote on one 1920 picture featuring the future president and an unknown woman carrying a golf club: \"father and an ugly lady.\" the critique is particularly telling when one notes that, for years, anna served as an unwilling middle woman within her parents' strained marriage and reluctantly broke the news to her mother that franklin was with his longtime mistress, lucy mercer rutherfurd, when he died of a stroke in 1945. \"i'll leave it up to historians to debate the complexities of father-daughter relationships, particularly as it relates to them,\" jennifer raab, the president of hunter college, said when asked about anna's caption. \"i'm sure anna was kidding around,\" said deborah gardner, head of history, tours and exhibits at the institute. the house is where, in 1921, franklin, newly stricken with polio, lay for months in the back bedroom on the third floor. upon learning of the stage-to-microphone commute he would have to make to endorse al smith at the 1924 democratic convention, franklin mapped out the 12-foot route and practiced the agonizing walk, enabled by leg braces and crutches. less than a decade later, he made his first radio broadcast as president-elect from the nearby drawing room. \"he was very good at conserving his energy,\" ms. gardner noted. \"he would make a point of receiving people at the home versus going to them.\" the dalai lama spoke at the house in 2010. ms. raab said he told her that one of his first memories after being recognized in 1942 as the 14th reincarnation of the guatama buddha was of getting a rolex from president roosevelt in the mail. \"the dalai lama told me he was more a fan of the box it came in, and played with it a lot, than the actual watch,\" ms. raab said.",

        "title": "chinese leader gets more sway on the economy and security.",
        "abstract": "hong kong president xi jinping of china emerged from a communist party leadership conference on tuesday with a mandate to give the market a \"decisive role\" in the world's second-largest economy and to consolidate new decision-making authority in his own hands. after a closed-door meeting of party leaders, officials announced that mr. xi would establish a new national security committee which experts said took inspiration from the national security council that serves american presidents as well as a leadership group that would push through a raft of economic overhauls. the two new agencies suggest that mr. xi aims to circumvent the ruling party's cumbersome bureaucracies and overcome resistance that deeper economic changes are likely to bring. mr. xi has signaled that he intends to overhaul a wide range of long-entrenched policies, including restrictions on land ownership in rural areas and state control of interest rates charged by banks. he and prime minister li keqiang have also vowed to wean china's economy from its dependence on highly polluting industries and extravagant government spending. a full list of overhauls discussed at the party meeting is expected to be made public in the coming days, though many are expected to be phased in only gradually. a year since assuming party leadership, mr. xi is also showing that he intends to govern in a more assertive, authoritarian style than his predecessor, hu jintao, who presided over a decade of rapid growth but failed to push through changes that many economists argue are needed to modernize the economy. \"he's demonstrating that he's really in charge,\" said christopher k. johnson, an expert on china at the center for strategic and international studies in washington, in a telephone interview from beijing. \"it's the clearest statement we've seen so far of his power inside the system.\" the new party leadership group on economic policy will oversee the introduction of market-oriented changes, and officials said there would be \"decisive outcomes\" in major policy areas by 2020. yet they also emphasized that party control must remain paramount even as china embraces more market forces in the economic sphere. \"most important is maintaining the party's leadership,\" said a communique. \"we must be bold and our steps steady.\" mr. xi, 60, has defied expectations that a new chinese leader must tiptoe politically in his first years. instead, he has moved quickly to reshape many policies and consolidate his control of the party's levers of power: the military forces, ideology and propaganda, the domestic security apparatus and anticorruption agency and now economic policy making. many analysts say mr. xi's background, as the son of a communist revolutionary who served under mao zedong and deng xiaoping, has made him more confident than recent party leaders in wielding power. by establishing the leadership group, mr. xi has wagered his credibility on his ability to push through changes that are likely to face resistance from government ministries, local governments and big state firms, said chen ziming, a commentator in beijing who closely follows party affairs. mr. xi is almost certain to lead the group, which economists have long called for to help accelerate economic restructuring, mr. chen said. \"this is placing responsibility on his own shoulders,\" he said. \"it's concentrating power in one person, so the responsibility will also be his.\" at the meeting, mr. xi and the other leaders vowed a more determined and concerted effort to act on promises of a bigger role for markets after a decade in which state power has swollen. the 204 central and provincial officials who attended as voting members of the central committee endorsed broad proposals for overhauling taxation, better integrating urban and rural society, and improving government services. image mr. xi has defied expectations that a new chinese leader must tiptoe politically in his first years. credit lan hongguang/xinhua, via associated press china's main evening news broadcast showed delegates to the conference seated in long rows of desks, listening attentively and taking notes as mr. xi and other officials spoke from a dais. \"we must establish fair, open and transparent market rules,\" said the communique from the meeting, which was issued by the official xinhua news agency. \"the core issue is properly handling the relationship between the government and markets, giving markets a decisive role in the allocation of resources while better applying the role of government.\" the party leaders emphasized, however, that the party-state, as well as state-run firms, would continue to play an important role in economic life. the communique said that both the public and private sectors were \"important foundations\" for economic growth. \"the key point for me is that the market has a clearly defined role resource allocation where it is to be promoted, but the role of the party and government in managing everything else in society is primary,\" said arthur kroeber, the managing director at gavekal dragonomics, an economic research firm. those resources could include land, minerals and fossil fuels. \"it represents a pretty ambitious agenda, although of course the details won't come for a while.\" mr. xi's immediate predecessor, mr. hu, also started his 10 years in office with a central committee third plenum that promised to drastically alter china's economy. but for all the changes under mr. hu, many analysts said he failed to defuse growing problems with pollution, local government debt and a recipe for growth too dependent on state-mandated lending and land confiscations. some analysts said that the momentum for change could falter again, as it did under mr. hu, with even more risky consequences. \"xi's main concern will be that there have been promises of major reform before, but promises without action,\" said deng yuwen, a chinese current affairs commentator who formerly worked for a newspaper published by the central party school. \"i think the communique makes clear that china will probably lean to liberalization and relaxation in the economy, but will remain quite conservative politically not unchanging, but conservative.\" mr. xi has accompanied his vows of economic rejuvenation with a drive to stifle political opposition to one-party rule at home and a tougher position on foreign policy issues, particularly in maritime territorial disputes with japan, vietnam and the philippines. in what appeared to be an effort to impose greater control over those areas, the conference approved establishing the new security committee. the formal english name of the new body was unclear, but state news media used the same chinese name for it as it uses for the national security council in the united states. for many years chinese officials have studied the workings of that body and other foreign security councils. the new committee would be a \"chinese version\" of the national security council in washington that serves as the coordinating body on foreign policy for american presidents, said jin canrong, a professor of international relations at renmin university in beijing. \"the situation needs that the external strategy is becoming more complicated,\" he said. the creation of the new committee is likely to magnify mr. xi's influence in foreign policy, mr. jin said. the committee is also likely to have a major say in domestic security issues, and mr. xi's ability to win approval for it after his predecessors had explored the idea and set it aside showed mr. xi's influence, said mr. johnson, the expert on china. the initial reports about the new security body did not explain how it would either coordinate with, or possibly replace, other party committees that steer policy on foreign affairs and domestic security. mr. xi and mr. li have said they want to encourage more confident consumer spending, and break down barriers excluding millions of rural migrants from access to schools, welfare and housing in urban society. many experts have said that those changes will not be feasible unless the chinese government gives farmers a firmer and more lucrative stake in their land, so they can sublease the land more easily, use it to raise loans and perhaps sell their leasehold rights if they decide to move permanently to towns and cities. the party leaders hinted that they were exploring how to give rural residents more control over and income from their land, which mostly remains under \"collective\" effectively, state ownership. \"grant farmers more property rights,\" said the communique.",

        "abstract": "moscow on a friday that began in washington with a triumphant presidential news conference about the conclusion of arms talks with russia , moscow seemed to have its mind on other things. president dmitri a. medvedev was in sochi, scolding olympic trainers over their athletes' dismal showing in vancouver. prime minister vladimir v. putin gave a speech on the dangers posed by spring flooding. the highest-ranking russian official to address reporters about the treaty was foreign minister sergey v. lavrov, who hastily gathered the press at dinnertime in a tiny ministry conference room. mr. lavrov called the agreement \"real progress\" in the relationship between russia and the united states, but added that russia could pull out if it concluded that the american missile defense plans had compromised its nuclear deterrent. indeed, unease over missile defense was seeping into commentary even as officials hailed a mutual success. mikhail v. margelov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of russia's parliament, said the document was \"neither a russian gift to america nor an american gift to russia.\" he acknowledged that the reception had been quiet, saying that was because negotiators were focused on finishing the job. \"we are on the edge of signing a treaty, so why make noise?\" mr. margelov said. \"i mean, speaking in colloquial language, let us drink champagne when we accomplish the task.\" in recent months russian leaders notably mr. putin have pushed openly for a pact that explicitly links reductions in strategic weapons to limits on the american missile-defense program. aleksei k. pushkov, the host of the political talk show \"post-scriptum,\" said he feared that the text of the treaty included only a \"soft linkage\" between offense and defense. for many russians, the first question will be, \"where have we made concessions to the united states?\" he said, and they will look for the answer in those phrases. \"the treaty will be criticized by a number of people people who are connected to the military, and political experts who will say it is a fig leaf which allows russia to save face, but does not allow russia to ask anything of the u.s., at least anything of substance,\" mr. pushkov said. \"should we have signed a treaty which does not give us any kind of serious guarantee?\" he said. \"this is something which will be debated.\" but if that conversation had begun on friday, it was a quiet one. as russia's arsenal ages, the treaty will allow moscow to maintain parity with the united states, which can afford a larger force, and arms talks serve to reassert its status as a nuclear superpower. gen. nikolai y. makarov, the chief of russia's general staff, spoke in favor of the pact, saying it \"will eliminate concerns on both sides and is fully in line with the security interests of russia.\" one reason for russian caution is the looming ratification vote in the united states senate, where any note of russian triumphalism might play badly. russia's opposition is too weak to block ratification here, though mr. margelov said he expected vigorous criticism from communists in parliament, for whom, as he put it, \"any agreement with the united states is considered a kind of betrayal of the motherland.\" he said he hoped they would all come to see the agreement for what it was: a compromise. \"all foreign policy is compromise,\" he said. \"i don't think we have to report to our public that it was a great diplomatic victory for russia. and our american colleagues should not deceive their public by saying it was a great american victory. it was a compromise. there is nothing wrong with that word.\"",

        "abstract": "mcallen, tex. jose antonio vargas, who has chronicled in minute detail the twists and turns of his life as a filipino living illegally for years in the united states, was detained by the border patrol for most of the day on tuesday and then released with a notice to appear before an immigration judge. the detention of mr. vargas, probably the most high-profile leader of the immigrant rights movement, posed an awkward dilemma for the obama administration. the surge of central americans, including many children , crossing the border illegally saying they are fleeing criminal violence at home has made all decisions about immigration politically fraught, and administration officials were keenly aware that the backdrop to their decision to release mr. vargas was a border where thousands of migrants are being held. mr. vargas was detained at a border patrol checkpoint in the airport of this city in the rio grande valley before he was to board a flight to houston, on his way to los angeles. in a terse statement, department of homeland security officials said they had released mr. vargas because he had no prior immigration or criminal record. they said their focus was on deporting immigrants who posed security threats. here's a photo of @joseiswriting in handcuffs, because the border patrol has nothing more pressing to do apparently pic.twitter.com/dn8kewqezr ryan grim (@ryangrim) july 15, 2014 it was the first time mr. vargas, who has been living without papers in the united states since 1993, had been arrested by immigration authorities. lawyers assisting him said that they would seek to have the action against him suspended, and that it was unlikely he would be deported. mr. vargas insisted that he never intended to be detained when he came to south texas. but he and his supporters wasted no time turning his arrest into a day of high drama, using it to publicize their cause on social media and at a news conference in front of the border patrol station where he was held. \"i was released today because i am a low priority and not considered a threat,\" mr. vargas said by telephone shortly after his release. \"i would argue that the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country are not a threat either.\" children at the border the number of children crossing the u.s. border alone has doubled since last year. answers to key questions on the crisis. president obama, seeking to stem the influx across the rio grande, has moved to deport recent crossers more quickly. he is also considering executive actions to expand protections from deportation for immigrants, like mr. vargas, who have lived here for years and pose no security threat. republicans argue that mr. obama's leniency with those immigrants has encouraged the border surge. mr. vargas has been traveling around the country with a philippine passport that is valid but has no united states visa. because of this valley's proximity to the mexican border, airports and roads leading out have border patrol checkpoints at which officers confirm travelers' immigration status. mr. vargas's arrest revealed the patchwork quilt of immigration enforcement that has allowed him to travel freely to 43 states in the last three years, since domestic airport security officials did not check his immigration status. but once he came to this heavily patrolled border region, he had to pass through a checkpoint to leave. as he approached the airport checkpoint on tuesday morning, he built suspense, sending out two posts on twitter. \"about to go thru security at mcallen airport. i don't know what's going to happen,\" he wrote, including a link to his advocacy organization. and then: \"the only ids i have for security: philippine passport and my pocketbook us constitution,\" with a photo of both documents. the police in minnesota had held mr. vargas in 2012 on a traffic violation, but immigration officials declined to detain him then. mr. vargas's mother sent him to the united states when he was 12. now 33, he was too old by a few months to qualify for a deportation deferral under a program mr. obama started in 2012 for young immigrants in the country illegally. immigrants with deferrals can travel legally within the united states. mr. vargas has been the main narrator of his story: in a first-person article in the new york times magazine in 2011 in which he declared his illegal status; in a cover story for time magazine; and, most recently, in a documentary film, \" documented ,\" for which he was both producer and star. he started a media campaign, define american, to cast light on the lives of immigrants in the country illegally. the group organized watch parties for a national broadcast of his film on cnn last month. he came to mcallen last week for a news conference and vigil organized by united we dream , a group for immigrant youth, outside a shelter for recently released central americans. image jose antonio vargas in june. credit kevork djansezian/reuters in an interview before his arrest, he said he had flown frequently in recent months to showings of the film around the country. \"i didn't even think twice about it,\" mr. vargas said of accepting the invitation to come here. when immigrant advocates familiar with security in the rio grande valley asked him how he was planning to leave, mr. vargas said he responded , \"no, this can't be for real.\" cristina jimenez, a leader of the group that extended the invitation, said that mr. vargas's arrest \"was never the intention or part of a broader plan. when the truth sunk in, we looked at each other's eyes in disbelief.\" but mr. vargas and his followers moved to take maximum advantage of the news exposure. advocacy networks were buzzing all day with text messages summoning people to call the border patrol station and demand his release. as a journalist for the washington post, mr. vargas shared in a pulitzer prize in 2008. in february 2013, he testified before a senate panel, sitting not far from a federal deportation officer. homeland security officials said the border patrol agents at the airport had arrested mr. vargas \"after he stated he was in the country illegally.\" after his release, mr. vargas said, \"i came down to this border, and i realized that it is a militarized zone.\" anticipating criticism that he had received special treatment because of his high profile, he said he was no different from most immigrants without papers. \"president obama should go big and bold with executive action to give us relief,\" he said.",

        "abstract": "kabul, afghanistan a taliban suicide bomber killed at least four foreign security guards on tuesday, steering an explosives-laden motorcycle into an afghan police compound and past several checkpoints before blowing up in an area occupied by trainers from dyncorp international, an american military contractor. the victims, three from nepal and one from peru, were guarding the entrance to buildings used by dyncorp within a fortified compound run by the counter narcotics police of afghanistan, said sayed mahdi kazemi, a spokesman for the counternarcotics force. seven other people were wounded, he said, including an afghan prosecutor. mr. kazemi said the afghan police staffed multiple checkpoints between the dyncorp offices, where police trainers work, and the main entrance to the police compound, which also houses the offices of afghanistan's deputy interior minister for counternarcotics. though he refused to discuss how the bomber had made it past the police, hashmatullah stanikzai, a spokesman for the police in kabul, said the attacker went undetected because he had been wearing the same uniform as the foreign guards. an official from the nato-led military coalition said there were suspicions that the attacker had inside help. an afghan in a uniform worn by foreign guards would \"strike me as more suspicious, not less, right?\" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid antagonizing his afghan counterparts. the compound is close to kabul's airport and near the scene of a taliban assault last week that disrupted flights into and out of the city for hours. that attack, the taliban said, was partly aimed at cutting off the afghan capital from its main link to the world beyond afghanistan. the insurgents also took credit for the attack on tuesday. zabiullah mujahid, a taliban spokesman, called dyncorp's part of the counternarcotics compound \"the center of foreign intelligence forces\" and claimed that 15 foreign soldiers had been killed or wounded. security guards from countries like nepal and peru are common at foreign military and diplomatic compounds in afghanistan. the guards, many of them nepalese veterans of the british army's gurkha regiments, usually provide a layer of security behind the afghan police and security guards, who staff the first line of checkpoints. the setup is used because of deep concerns about the efficacy and loyalty of the police, a force that is riddled with corruption and drug use. it also provides a final layer of defense should afghan guards turn on the foreigners they are guarding.",

        "abstract": "to the sports editor: re \"the mascot will sit this one out, thanks,\" nov. 9: a tiger's home range is thousands of times bigger than mike vi's enclosure at louisiana state. tigers shun human contact. being on display on a busy college campus and periodically hauled in front of huge, noisy crowds is undeniably stressful for a wild animal. it's no wonder mike is balking at participating in the pregame tradition. tigers exist to control large territories, to seek out prey and hunt, and to roam far and wide. being denied these fundamental drives is cruel. mike has nothing that gives his life meaning. it's time for this institution of higher education to put this cruel mascot tradition in its history books. philip tripp buffalo in morocco's defense to the sports editor: re \"africa cup disrupted by ebola concerns,\" nov. 12: since the beginning of the ebola outbreak, morocco has been a constant partner to ebola-affected countries. royal air maroc remains one of just two airlines that have continued flights to the three countries most affected by the disease. morocco has taken strong measures to protect against ebola by increasing health screenings at airports and providing training materials to medical staffs. the decision to request a postponement of the african cup of nations tournament until the outbreak is under control is yet another sign of the country's leadership on this issue. we should commend the country for standing firm even as organizers barred the moroccan team. edward m. gabriel washington the writer is a former united states ambassador to morocco, and he currently advises the government of morocco. another mets blunder to the sports editor: re \"mets make statement, signing rockies' cuddyer,\" nov. 11: this is another disastrous move for the mets for three big reasons. first, michael cuddyer has always been a defensive liability, well below average at first and in the outfield; that's bad news for mets pitchers. second, at the start of next season, he will be 36, an age at which nearly all hitters in the post-steroids era are in decline. third, cuddyer's resurgence over the past three years, including a batting title and an all-star selection, is 100 percent attributable to his playing half his games at coors field in denver, where offensive statistics are inflated. prediction: cuddyer will play fewer than 100 games in 2015, hit about 10 homers, drive in roughly 50 runs, slug a bit above .400, clog up the base paths and give away dozens of runs in the field. and 2016 will be worse. slightly above average, perhaps, but certainly not worth $21 million over two years. dan greenblatt seattle",

        "abstract": "san juan, p.r. jose reyes received a text message from carlos delgado, his mets teammate, on saturday afternoon. it was not an invitation to dinner. delgado wondered how the big, bad players from the dominican republic had lost to the neophytes from the netherlands. \"good question, i said,\" reyes explained on sunday. \"you watch the game?\" reyes tried to answer the question that was asked from fields in santo domingo to street corners in washington heights and plenty of places in between. how did the dominicans let a team of mostly unknown players defeat them saturday in the world baseball classic? reyes tried to be respectful toward the dutch. reyes said anything could happen in any game, but, without much prodding, he added that the dominicans were \"way better\" than the netherlands. that may be true, but the netherlands left the dominicans a loss from elimination. \"if we don't win this one,\" reyes said before facing panama, \"we go home.\" for now, the dominicans are staying here. they capitalized on panama's sloppiness, displayed their power with three home runs and showed they still had a pulse in scampering to a 9-0 victory at hiram bithorn stadium. panama was ousted from the double-elimination tournament. on tuesday, the dominicans will oppose the loser of monday's game between puerto rico and the netherlands. so there is a possibility they will get a chance for redemption against the netherlands. reyes said he would send a text message to delgado, who plays for puerto rico. \"talk now, we win,\" said reyes, in describing his message. \"make sure you're ready when we play you.\" the dominicans received some much-needed relief in the third when they scored three runs off ramiro mendoza on two hits, two infield errors and an intentional walk to reyes. it was not a muscular display, but the power soon came. miguel olivo had a two-run homer in the fourth and a three-run shot in the eighth, and nelson cruz added a solo home run in the sixth. johnny cueto started and pitched four and two-thirds scoreless innings. reyes, benched against the netherlands in favor of hanley ramirez, started at shortstop sunday. even though manager felipe alou does not want to play reyes or ramirez at a different position, the dominicans would be much better with their two most dynamic players in the lineup. reyes volunteered to move. \"if he wants me to play another position, i'm going to play,\" said reyes, who went 0 for 4 sunday. \"i'm here to represent my country anywhere on the field.\" as noble as it was for reyes to say he would switch positions, the mets would undoubtedly balk at having one of their most important players at another position. reyes played 43 games at second during the forgettable kazuo matsui experiment in 2004, but he has not played second since. making the blind pivot as a second baseman could be dangerous for reyes. the florida marlins do not want ramirez playing anywhere else, either. still, when reyes was asked how he thought the mets would feel about him playing a new position, he theorized that they would agree with him. \"they know i want to represent my country,\" reyes said. \"i'm here to play the game.\" the dominicans have too many shortstops. they have a shortstop playing third base in miguel tejada. they have no steady first baseman because david ortiz is the designated hitter, and they have some light-hitting outfielders. alou had hoped to start ortiz at first and use ramirez and reyes as his shortstop and designated hitter, but ortiz has a stiff left shoulder so the boston red sox do not want him playing the field. ortiz, who did not play a game at first last year, laughed and said \"i don't know,\" when asked last week about the prospects of playing first in the classic. alou mentioned the possibility of starting ortiz at first on tuesday, but that seems unlikely. for the last few days, alou has lamented how many players are absent from his roster and how he has tried to patch together a lineup. alex rodriguez, who will have hip surgery monday, and adrian beltre, another third baseman, left the team a few days before the tournament. albert pujols, alfonso soriano and vladimir guerrero are among the other dominicans who cited concerns about injuries in deciding not to play. \"we don't have the best dominican players here,\" alou said. \"it tells you things about the classic. we have two of the best shortstops in the business and then we play a different guy at first base every day. our third baseman is a shortstop.\" if alou rotates shortstops each game, reyes will be benched tuesday. that is another game the dominicans must win, another game in which reyes would be valuable. even reyes seemed uncertain how he would try to squeeze both shortstops into the lineup if he were the manager. \"that's a good question,\" reyes said. \"i don't have an answer for that.\"",

        "abstract": "sestriere, italy, feb. 22 - there were no more awards celebrations more joyless than anja paerson's accepting her two bronze medals in the women's combined and the downhill earlier in the turin olympics. she forced a wave to her fans in the grandstand, but paerson, the reigning overall world cup champion from sweden, did nothing to hide her disappointment. the 24-year-old paerson came to turin with a silver and a bronze medal from the 2002 salt lake city games. two more bronze medals did not fill the prominent hole in her ski racing resume. so wednesday, when paerson finally won her first olympic gold medal, in the women's slalom, she threw her arms in the air, and performed her trademark belly slide, which she calls the walrus. paerson gets a running start and flings herself down the finish-area slope on her stomach with her arms and legs splayed outward. and she cried on the top step of the medal podium. \"it is a day when i felt in total harmony,\" said paerson, who slightly injured a knee practicing during the race's warm-up period. \"even when things seemed to be slipping away, when the other girls skied well and i hurt my knee, i was calm. i was sure this was the day, an amazing day.\" the night race was contested with light snow and dense fog obscuring the lighted racecourse nearly from gate to gate. paerson led after the first of two runs, but several top racers put pressure on her with swift second runs. paerson, the last elite skier waiting in the start gate, could hardly coast to a victory. her aggressive and efficient second run gave her a total time of 1 minute 29.04 seconds, which was 0.29 seconds ahead of the silver-medal winner, nicole hosp of austria. hosp's teammate marlies schild won the bronze medal with a sparkling run that allowed her to jump from sixth place after the first run. the austrian alpine team has won 11 medals in the 2006 olympics, and 101 in olympic history. the next closest country is switzerland, which has won 53. paerson's dramatic second run also knocked her chief rival, janica kostelic of croatia, off the medal podium. kostelic, who was the runner-up to paerson in the overall world cup standings last year and whose relationship with her had been sometimes frosty, finished fourth. kostelic, who has six medals in the past two olympics, failed to win a medal for the first time in seven olympic events. afterward, she said she might not race in the giant slalom friday because of a lingering illness. paerson said her knee injury hurt enough that her father and coach, anders, asked if she wanted to skip wednesday's race to rest for the giant slalom. \"but i said, 'no, i'm doing this today,' \" paerson said. \"there had already been days at these olympics when i felt a little bit unlucky. the snow conditions were against me, and things weren't working out. i wasn't going to dwell on any negatives anymore.\" paerson's victory was aided by the disqualification of kathrin zettel of austria in the first slalom run. zettel, ranked third in the world in the slalom, was on a pace to knock paerson off the top of the leader board halfway through her first run when she suddenly skied off the course. \"i don't know what went wrong,\" zettel said. \"i felt so good, and now i feel so bad.\" kristina koznick, the united states' best slalom skier for the past several years, skied wednesday despite a torn anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee, an injury sustained in training just days before the olympics. on wednesday, she struggled through her first run and finished 34th, more than 3 seconds behind paerson. koznick withdrew before her second run. she will have knee surgery monday in vail, colo. \"it took a lot of courage to go from being on crutches to being here,\" koznick said afterward. \"i wanted a fairy tale, and i guess it didn't happen. but i'm happy i tried.\" the 30-year-old koznick said she might retire. \"this has been very hard, and i spent a lot of time crying at the timing of it all,\" she said. \"i don't know if this is the last race of my career or not. it's hard to think about going out this way.\" sarah schleper, in 10th, was the top american finisher. lindsey kildow, still recovering from a back injury sustained during a downhill training crash last week, was 14th.",

        "abstract": "the journalist nikki finke has long struck fear into the hearts of hollywood executives and entertainers, publishing a blend of vitriol and scoops on her blog deadline hollywood. in recent weeks, though, she had gone silent in the face of a legal dispute with the company that bought deadline, penske media corporation. it looked as if her career as a chronicler of hollywood might be over. but now, a book deal and possible return to journalism are in the works. ms. finke made headlines this week after an anonymous group calling itself \"the committee for decency in journalism\" published a website, nikkistink.com, that posted pictures and video of the rarely photographed ms. finke. it also threatened to disclose more secrets about ms. finke's private life if she did not stop publishing her biting journalism. though most of that was taken down by thursday, the website caused a stir in hollywood. it also had an unintended effect, prompting a series of conversations between ms. finke and her former employer, jay penske, said a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. those talks could mean she will write again for penske, which also owns variety. the two recently signed a settlement agreement worth millions to ms. finke. ms. finke has also nearly completed a nonfiction book on hollywood that will be published by simon & schuster, its president, jonathan karp, said in an email. mr. karp, who said he was editing the book himself, declined to provide details about its contents and said a publication date had not been set. \"whenever we publish,\" he wrote, \"the book will be an event.\" a book by ms. finke will likely be met with dread in movie and television industry circles. an open letter to ms. finke, published this week on the mystery website, said that for years she had \"threatened and bullied the hollywood community into providing you information so that you could use it to ridicule, abuse and destroy people.\" the website listed 79 insults she had directed at stars like robin williams and executives like the former disney chief michael eisner, most of them unprintable. beneath them, under the bold headline \"gotja!\" a dig at ms. finke's habit of writing \"toldja\" in her posts were photographs of ms. finke that appeared to have been taken secretly. the site also included some personal information, including pictures of her apartment, and it mocked ms. finke for her weight, calling her \"large.\" by thursday, the site's content was replaced with a shorter letter. \"we think we've made our point,\" it said. \"should it become necessary to add even more powerful content we will. believe us, we have it.\" it is unclear who is behind the site. it is registered to domains by proxy, a company in scottsdale, ariz., that protects the identities of people who sign up for websites. its source code reveals little about its creators, except that the site had been set up with technology intended to serve large quantities of web traffic quickly, without crashing. the creators also appeared to have stripped identifying information from the pictures. \"this is like the board game clue,\" said matthew belloni, the executive editor of the hollywood reporter, which was among the first to report the site's existence. \"everyone in this town is a suspect.\" some, like mike fleming jr. of deadline, denounced the site, calling it \" reprehensible, meanspirited and disgusting .\" others said that it was, if anything, too easy on her journalistic tactics, though they would not say so for public attribution. ms. finke started her blog in 2006, just as people began to exploit the web's potential to spread stories that would not have found homes in traditional newspapers. she became known as a machine for scoops, and for her tough, personal style of reporting and writing. in 2009, penske acquired the site. and then, in 2012, it also bought the industry trade magazine variety, a competitor to deadline. that set off a dispute that caused ms. finke to leave the company. this june, she started nikkifinke.com, her own site, and again began reporting on hollywood in apparent defiance of a noncompete agreement with penske. she stopped writing on aug. 11. because of restrictions connected to the settlement negotiations, neither ms. finke nor penske representatives can speak publicly on the split or its aftermath. ms. finke has also been approached by graydon carter, the editor of vanity fair, about potentially writing for his magazine. on twitter thursday, ms. finke raised another possibility for her future to her 233,000 followers. jack shafer, a media columnist for reuters, had suggested she \"pack up my act and bring it to dc,\" she wrote . \"others saying the same thing. should i?\"",

        "title": "who's alvin greene? state asks after vote.",
        "abstract": "washington for a few hours this week, it looked as if south carolina might ditch its never-fail reputation for political scandal in favor of a genuine history-making event. there was nikki haley , a lawmaker of indian descent, beaming on election night with her husband and children after taking a major step toward becoming the first female governor of the state. it was a feel-good image to obscure the stain of a campaign marked by ethnic slurs, accusations of marital infidelity and yet more national marveling over how a single state can produce a string of political embarrassments as long as the appalachian trail. but then, the television cameras started rolling on alvin greene's overgrown lawn. \"yeah, it's been pretty nonstop for a few days,\" said mr. greene, 32, in a phone interview friday. because everyone wants to know how mr. greene, an unemployed army veteran who had been completely unknown until tuesday, inexplicably defeated a heavily favored former legislator and judge to become the state's democratic nominee for the senate and the state's latest political circus act. mr. greene had just a few peaceful hours to savor his victory in the tiny, ramshackle home he shares with his elderly father along a quiet highway in manning, where he has been bunkered since election night. then, the associated press reported that mr. greene was arrested in november and is facing a felony obscenity charge; he is accused of showing pornography to a university of south carolina student. he had been discharged \"involuntarily\" from the army and showed no signs of having waged an actual campaign in recent months no advertising, no staff, no money. mr. greene, who declined to comment on the obscenity charge, would not say how he came up with the $10,440 to register his candidacy. representative james e. clyburn, democrat of south carolina and the house majority whip, suggested that mr. greene was a \"republican plant\" and that the circumstance reeked of the \"shenanigans\" that have become the state's trademark. \"we have embarrassment fatigue here,\" said dick harpootlian, the former democratic chairman of the state. \"if there is an embarrassment equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder , south carolina has it.\" even casual observers across the country can recite the recent litany of palmetto state political antics. the republican donnybrook between john mccain and george w. bush in 2000 left more scars than any presidential primary campaign in recent memory. gov. mark sanford 's public swoon over an argentinean mistress an affair he carried on while claiming to have been hiking the appalachian trail remains a spigot of late-night punch lines (while mr. sanford remains the state's governor). the republican primary campaign to succeed mr. sanford featured two operatives claiming to have had extramarital affairs with ms. haley (who strenuously denied the accusations) as well as a republican state senator dismissing her with an ethnic slur. now comes mr. greene, adding democratic balance to the state's republican-dominated scandal sheets of recent vintage. mr. clyburn immediately called for someone to investigate mr. greene's candidacy who paid for the campaign, who was behind it, how did he ever win? mr. harpootlian, a former district attorney, wants to know why mr. greene had not filed any papers with the federal election commission , and don fowler, a former democratic national committee chairman from south carolina, said he suspected that someone tampered with the voting machines. \"there is something genuinely mysterious about this whole thing,\" said mr. fowler, whose wife, carol, the current chairwoman of the state's democratic party , has called for mr. greene to step aside. mr. greene said he had no intention of doing so. he said the whole gambit has been his idea, that he paid the entry fee and that his was and remains \"a self-managed campaign.\" he said he would challenge his republican opponent, senator jim demint , to a debate in september. \"it will be one hour. live. on a major network,\" he proposed. mr. greene said he was determined to go through with this, which would seem to belie the somewhat shell-shocked demeanor he has projected in several interviews over the last 72 hours. \"can i end this?\" mr. greene asked in the middle of a brief interview with a local television station in front of his house wednesday. it might as well be his campaign's official motto, or wish, at least as far as leading democrats are concerned. \"sad,\" mr. clyburn said, referring to the spectacle that mr. greene has become on the cable and youtube circuits. even in manning, a town of 4,000 where everybody knows everybody, nobody seems to know alvin greene. \"he just all of a sudden shows up and boom!\" said l. g. mathis, 61, the owner of l. g.'s cut and style, a barber shop downtown. it is another embarrassment for south carolina, said carl f. jackson jr, a graphic designer at a local newspaper, the clarendon citizen. \"anybody who got beyond eighth grade is a little astounded by this,\" mr. jackson said, adding his own theory of how mr. greene had won. \"maybe voters thought it was the singer, al green.\" when asked in a phone interview friday whether he was having \"fun,\" mr. greene quickly answered yes, before asking for clarification. \"what do you mean by fun?\" without waiting for an answer, mr. greene said he was not interested in \"fun,\" or signing autographs (which he has yet to do) or indulging any of the trappings of his unlikely celebrity. he is interested in sticking to the issues that are important jobs, education, justice and to conveying why he is \"the best candidate for the united states senate in south carolina.\" before elaborating on why he was, mr. greene excused himself, saying that he had to finish another interview.",

        "title": "the statistician edward tufte illustrates geometry in sculpture.",
        "abstract": "it is rare for a show of outdoor sculpture to be both visually beguiling and intellectually stimulating. but \"seeing around,\" the first major museum show of the work of edward tufte , is both. to better accommodate his work, mr. tufte has reconstructed the topography of the aldrich contemporary art museum's three-acre garden mounds and walls were built, and dozens of new white pine, spruce and red cedar trees planted. the remodeling took five months. before the opening, in june 2009, almost nobody in the art world had heard of mr. tufte, who lives and works in cheshire and is a well-known statistician and a professor emeritus at yale and the author of influential books in analytical design using data and information. but in the last decade, mr. tufte has produced about 50 large-scale sculptures and 100 smaller table pieces, along with numerous prints. showing here are examples of all three groups of work, including 20 of the outdoor sculptures, and, in the museum's project space gallery, many smaller objects, models and prints. mr. tufte's best works are his sculptures, especially the outdoor pieces, usually fabricated from milled steel or an amalgam of bits and pieces of scrap metal. all of them tend to be abstract, frequently inspired by geometry but almost always asymmetrical. to a degree, the outdoor sculptures can be understood as a response to the artist's academic studies of visual displays of data and information. for instance, the geometries of these works are noticeable for the ways in which they are designed to absorb, reflect and alter sunlight to create a multiplicity of shadows and interesting visual effects. this is science as much as art. take, for instance, the five stainless steel pieces included in the \"bouquet\" (2006-8) series showing here, in which changes in surface texture including grinding, scraping, brushing, polishing and scratching yield all kinds of subtle adjustments in reflected light. meanwhile, cuts, bends, folds and perforations in the steel result in interesting, overlapping shadows. yet as nuanced and clever as these works are, you do occasionally get the sense that they are almost too mathematical, too thought out, leading to an absence of spontaneity and feeling. it is one thing to know that a sculpture is designed to encompass endless, complex experiences of space, light and color, and another to encounter it. two of the most impressive pieces on display outdoors are monumental sculptures: \"rocket science # 2 (lunar lander)\" (2009), a bizarre contraption that looks like a massive ray gun, and \"larkin's twig\" (2004), three narrow steel beams arranged to create a 32-foot-high tripod structure that has been carefully integrated into the landscape, rather than simply imposed on the site. \"rocket science # 2 (lunar lander)\" incorporates discarded scrap metal, including materials from a nuclear power plant, and the main shaft is made from a monopole, used to hold up high-tension wires. i cannot recall seeing a work of outdoor sculpture on this scale it is 70 feet long and weighs 48,000 pounds outside of storm king. the shadows it gives off are pretty amazing. it is also impressive to enter the museum parking lot and see the huge, rusted skeleton of a tractor jutting into the air, balanced on a steel pivot. this is \"skewed machine\" (2006), one of the more playful, eccentric works in the show. here the artist has done little to enhance an existing object, but by changing its orientation, he makes us see it in a new way. walking through the garden, the visitor's attention is drawn to other pieces, so many in fact that i suspect the outdoor display is slightly overhung. never mind, for the sculptures add a pulsating energy to the landscape. i saw the exhibition before the snow arrived, and i look forward to returning to view the works under different weather conditions. this is a show for all seasons.",

        "title": "hurricane matthew makes old problems worse for haitians.",
        "abstract": "the first reports to arrive were of vast flooding and destruction, rivers of brown water pulsing through streets and homes shorn of tin roofs. eventually, the talk turned to livestock lost, a veritable fortune for those living in the poorest country in the western hemisphere. but three days after the worst storm to strike haiti in more than 50 years, the death toll is rising, and fast. from initial estimates of five dead, the government is now saying more than 280 people have been killed in hurricane matthew and its aftermath, the worst natural disaster to strike the nation since the earthquake of 2010. others are reporting even more deaths. reuters said that its own compilation, based on information from civil protection and local officials, showed at least 842 had been confirmed dead on friday. the storm left a broad tableau of devastation: houses pummeled into timber, crops destroyed and stretches of towns and villages under several feet of water. in the southern city of jeremie, 80 percent of the buildings were destroyed. the numbers of known dead soared as officials and aid workers ventured deeper into areas cut off from rescue efforts in the south, discovering more bodies interred in flooded homes and streets. until thursday, there had been no connection to the south of the country neither electronic nor physical, owing to severed phone lines and collapsed bridges. \"this is a very, very partial assessment of the damage and death,\" said annick joseph, the country's interior minister, during a news conference earlier in the day. among other things, he added, dead were also being discovered in the mountains of the country, where communities are more isolated. the sudden surge in numbers reflects, in some ways, the very nature of the many challenges that haiti faces. the country's infrastructure had been in decline for decades, even before the earthquake and other storms weakened it further. a fragile communications system, too, was unreliable even in the best of times. these challenges and others are part of the reason the government so vastly underestimated the number of deaths, and why, many think, the number will continue to rise. more fundamentally, it meant that there was little the government was capable of doing to prepare and to respond. \"that many people died because they never believed what the authorities told them when they said they had to evacuate,\" said jean senozier despreux, who lives and works in les cayes and weathered the storm there. \"they resisted it.\" image homes lay in ruin in les cayes, haiti. credit dieu nalio chery/associated press in a telephone interview, he said the surge in death numbers was not surprising to him. \"we knew we would continue find people under the rubble,\" he said. \"it was so intense there was no way out.\" enzo di taranto, the head of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in haiti, said there would \"be a severe impact on the environment, agriculture and water systems.\" \"schools, hospitals and police stations, everything that was there when the hurricane hit was in some way damaged, because of the strengths of the wind,\" mr. di taranto said. on wednesday, officials said the hurricane's heavy damage had forced them to postpone an already-delayed presidential election set for sunday in the country of 11 million. this latest disaster revives unresolved questions that continue to haunt the country from the 2010 earthquake, when international aid groups practically usurped the role of the government. the government has been clear that this time around it will take the lead on coordinating aid, as donors bring in fresh water, food and money. yet that approach, too, has its limitations. the current government is an interim administration that was to be replaced in the sunday election. there is no word on when that vote will be rescheduled. for international aid organizations, striking a balance between working with the government and delivering lifesaving assistance expeditiously will define the coming months of the crisis, many say. \"there was a lot of taking stock of what lessons were learned after 2010,\" said jake johnston, research associate at the center for economic and policy research in washington. \"and then you see a disaster and it all goes out the window and it's immediate, whatever we can do as fast as possible,\" he said. image crossing the digue river in petit-goave. a bridge collapsed during the hurricane. credit hector retamal/agence france-presse getty images at the same time, he said, for donors, \"bypassing the government is not going to save the day in the end.\" aid groups especially fear cholera, a waterborne infection that has stubbornly plagued haiti since shortly after the earthquake, when it was believed to have been inadvertently introduced by united nations peacekeepers assigned to the country. care haiti, a charity, said in a report that three cases of cholera had already turned up in southern peninsula hospitals. partners in health, an international charity that has long worked in haiti, said there had been 26,000 cases of cholera this year. according to the united nations, more than one million people have been affected by the storm in haiti and at least a third of them will require humanitarian assistance. mr. di taranto's united nations office, which is helping coordinate assistance between the government and humanitarian groups, said that more than 15,000 people were in emergency shelters. the civil protection force of haiti put the figure countrywide at closer to 27,000 people, with the majority in the south. at least 20,000 homes were wrecked and hundreds of haitians were injured, officials said. in the largest banana-growing area of the country, more than 80 percent of the crops that feed 20,000 families were destroyed by the winds and flooding, according to mercy corps. in jeremie, the capital of the southern department of grande anse, there was near-total destruction. in les cayes, another southern area where the storm wrought the most damage and across the peninsula from jeremie, people lost their homes, livestock and possessions. southerners in particular rely on subsistence farming, on lands that have now been flooded. \"we're very worried about the country's future in terms of food security,\" said hervil cherubin, country director in haiti for heifer international , a nonprofit that works with more than 6,500 farming families in the south. \"most of the crops are gone. many of the farm fields are like landfills. they're full of trash, seawater, gravel and other debris.\"",

        "abstract": "maintaining that they face widespread minimum-wage violations, workers at a bronx carwash belonging to one of the city's largest carwash owners voted to unionize on saturday, making it the second of new york city's 200 or so carwashes where workers joined a union. the workers at webster carwash, nearly all of them immigrants, voted 23 to 5 to unionize after a six-month campaign, according to officials with the retail, wholesale and department store union, which joined with several worker advocacy groups to organize the employees. the effort was part of a campaign to unionize dozens of new york city carwashes with the aim of achieving better wages, worker treatment and safety conditions. last month, workers at astoria car wash and hi-tek 10 minute lube in queens became the first carwash not just in new york, but on the entire east coast, to unionize, voting 21 to 5 to do so. webster carwash is owned by lage management corporation, which owns several dozen carwashes that have faced a wave of wage lawsuits and investigations. the company, headed by john lage, agreed to pay $3.4 million in back wages and damages in 2009 to 1,187 current and former employees to settle a lawsuit accusing it of many wage violations. and last spring, officials in the office of the new york state attorney general, eric t. schneiderman, said they were investigating mr. lage's carwashes over possible wage violations. ernesto salazar, an immigrant from el salvador who has worked at webster carwash for six years, said he was delighted about the vote. \"this is a time for immigrant workers to earn a voice through their union to speak up to their bosses,\" mr. salazar said in spanish through an interpreter. \"the union will support us in pushing to raise wages. you can't afford to live here on the amount they pay us.\" mr. salazar says he earned $6.50 an hour, 75 cents below the federal minimum wage. he said he had been earning $5.50 an hour, but received a raise after the unionization drive started. he said he does receive some cash tips. he added that the workers wanted better safety training and conditions in light of the many chemicals they use in cleaning and polishing cars. an employee at webster carwash who answered the telephone on sunday said that no manager was available to answer questions from a reporter. and an employee who answered for mr. lage's main corporate office in pelham manor, n.y., said to call back on monday because the office was closed. mr. lage's son michael lage, who is also part of the business, has in the past denied accusations of wage violations, saying that the lawsuits and claims the company's carwashes face were part of an effort by the union to attract new members and their dues payments. the retail workers union had worked closely with two advocacy groups, make the road new york and new york communities for change . the groups have submitted petitions to unionize two other lage-owned carwashes, one in soho and one in queens. there are an estimated 5,000 carwash workers in the city. \"we are proud of the employees at webster, who have taken a significant step toward improving their jobs and their lives by voting to join the union,\" said stuart appelbaum, president of the retail, wholesale and department store union. \"these brave workers stood up to their employer, like david slaying goliath.\" last april, the city's public advocate, bill de blasio, pointing to the wage violation charges, urged city agencies to stop using lage-owned carwashes to clean city vehicles. he said that since 2010, the city had paid the lage management corporation more than $170,000 for cleaning city cars.",

        "title": "illinois not alone in struggling to pass a state budget.",
        "abstract": "chicago as a new fiscal year opened on wednesday, illinois's leaders had no state budget, no hint of an agreement on the horizon, and no consensus about what all of it will mean for services to residents and for paying public employees and state contractors. gov. bruce rauner, a republican in his first term, said that state employees would work and be paid as usual, and that he planned to minimize disruptions in the state. but some democrats, who control the state legislature, said payments to contractors and workers would stop in a matter of weeks without a budget or some special dispensation. as wednesday progressed and lawmakers heard testimony about how a shutdown might disrupt state services, the two sides struggled even to agree on a method of temporary funding. \"we've got a mess,\" mr. rauner told state workers on tuesday, days after he vetoed much of the democrats' budget, which included a deficit. \"it's going to take a little while to fix.\" illinois is not alone in its budget impasse. new fiscal years began on wednesday in most states, but leaders in at least four others, including pennsylvania, wisconsin and north carolina, had yet to reach final spending plans. in about a half-dozen other states, including connecticut, delaware and washington, budgets were approved only in the final days or, in some cases, the final hours. while governments routinely wrestle with budgets, experts said the number of states with unfinished plans and the amount of discord over questions of tax level, pension policy and education spending were unusual. increasingly, states are grappling with a new array of questions in a changing climate: whether to tax online purchases, whether to expand taxes on services, and how to manage previously allowed tax credits and exemptions. image lobbyists waited monday outside the house chamber at the washington state capitol. late tuesday, the governor signed a $38.2 billion budget. credit rachel la corte/associated press \"this all goes to show what intractable budget situations we have even seven years after the recession,\" said sujit m. canagaretna, fiscal policy manager at the council of state governments. \"states are still struggling to come up with revenue. the big elephant in the room taxes is the issue that is underlying this whole discussion. and i think we're going to see more of this going forward.\" some of the most intense fights have emerged in states with divided control of government, like illinois. in pennsylvania, gov. tom wolf, a democrat, late tuesday vetoed a republican-backed spending plan. the governor had called for more spending on education and a severance tax on natural gas, while republicans sought the privatization of state liquor sales and pension changes. a long standoff could affect the timing of state payments to contractors, but pennsylvania officials said that no immediate shutdown was expected and that state facilities, including parks, would remain open, according to jeff sheridan, a spokesman for mr. wolf. yet even states with a single party in control of government have found themselves mired in budget battles this year. in wisconsin, where gov. scott walker is expected to announce a presidential run in the coming weeks, his fellow republicans have clashed over the governor's budget proposal and over road construction, financing a new milwaukee bucks arena and the state's prevailing wage law, which sets standards for pay on public construction. on wednesday, legislative leaders announced the framework of a budget deal, which did not include the basketball arena or prevailing wage, both of which will be considered separately. a legislative committee was expected to take up the budget bill later this week. provisions in wisconsin allow for government to continue functioning in the new fiscal year before a budget is passed. in south carolina, gov. nikki r. haley, a republican, signed a budget but issued dozens of line-item vetoes on monday. the legislature, dominated by republicans, is expected to consider overrides next week. image the newly approved $40 billion connecticut state budget on tuesday before it was signed by gov. dannel p. malloy. credit jessica hill/associated press and in kansas, where republicans control the capitol, legislators passed a budget bill after a tense session that was the longest in state history. parts of that agreement were threatened by a court ruling that the method of funding schools was unconstitutional, but that ruling has been stayed by the kansas supreme court. in some states, lawmakers in essence granted themselves extensions, passing resolutions that permit the government to operate temporarily so they can continue hashing out budget disputes beyond the new fiscal year. massachusetts officials funded the government through july as lawmakers continue to meet in conference committee. in new hampshire, gov. maggie hassan, a democrat, vetoed a two-year budget from lawmakers in part because of tax breaks it granted to businesses, but she signed a short-term plan that allows the government to function. and in north carolina, a continuing resolution will finance government operations through mid-august, giving the house and senate a chance to resolve a standoff over broad parts of the budget. state representative chuck mcgrady, a republican who serves on north carolina's house appropriations committee, said a budget agreement was far from certain, even now, with extra time. \"i wouldn't say i was optimistic,\" mr. mcgrady said. \"is it possible? yes. is it possible we'll be coming back and needing more time? yes.\" in illinois, officials were scrambling to sort out what having no budget will mean. \"we're going to try to manage through this as best we can,\" tim nuding, mr. rauner's budget director, told lawmakers on tuesday. image gov. tom wolf of pennsylvania after a news conference. he wants more education spending and a severance tax on natural gas credit james robinson/the patriot news, via associated press democrats pushed an \"essential services\" budget on wednesday that would have funded state government for a month, but it failed in the house after clearing the senate. lawmakers will be back at the capitol next tuesday. mr. rauner and the democrats, who control the legislature, have battled for months with few signs of progress. he has demanded sweeping change, including an overhaul of workers' compensation rules, term limits for lawmakers and a freeze on property taxes. democratic leaders have said new revenues were needed to fill a budget deficit of more than $3 billion. another issue has loomed over budget negotiations here: a significant problem with the financing of government pensions for the state as well as for chicago and the city's public schools. chicago public schools borrowed money to make a required $634 million payment on tuesday to a teachers' pension fund. that payment followed a long debate over whether the state might allow a delay and warnings that paying the full cost would affect classroom instruction. hours after paying the pension fund, the public school system announced $200 million in cuts. around 1,400 employee positions \"will be impacted beginning wednesday,\" the district said, leading to a rebuke from the teachers' union. chicago public schools has about 41,000 workers. for his part, mr. rauner spent part of the day visiting state workers, urging them to keep coming to work while negotiations continue. \"we're going to try to minimize the stress on your families,\" he said. \"i want to make darn sure you're paid.\"",

        "title": "a different (and surprising) economic tale of new york city emerges.",
        "abstract": "when bill de blasio ran for mayor in 2013, he declared that new york city's middle class wasn't just shrinking, but also stood \"in real danger of disappearing altogether.\" the claim was part of the tale-of-two-cities theme that drove his campaign, the gilded metropolis indifferently snuffing out its gasping work force. meanwhile, there was julian soto of jamaica, queens, who was making minimum wage as a warehouse man for a newsstand company at kennedy international airport two years ago. now, said mr. soto, 25, his annual salary with overtime is \"pushing $50,000\" at the james hotel in soho. as a new employee, he is being paid 75 percent of the full union contract rate for his first two years. \"put it this way my refrigerator is never empty,\" mr. soto said. be careful around anecdotes; they are the black ice of reality. vast and varied, new york is so textured that pixel-size facts can be mistaken for larger truths. but mr. soto is not a fluke. far from disappearing, midlevel jobs that pay $50,000 to $100,000 a year are expected to account for 42 percent of the job growth in new york over the next four years, according to a forecast by the city's independent budget office . no one drinks champagne for breakfast on $50,000 or even $75,000 in new york. still, this is a vital shift: over much of the last decade, most new jobs in the city paid less than $50,000. it was the core critique of michael r. bloomberg 's mayoralty by mr. de blasio as a candidate. just last week, during a budget presentation, mr. de blasio emphasized how much of the city's current expansion was in low-wage jobs, and said fighting \"income inequality\" would remain a focus of his administration. mayors have little power over big economic trends. they cannot print money. that does not mean there is nothing they can do. mr. de blasio has lobbied for a higher minimum wage, and is requiring developments subsidized by the city to pay higher salaries both measures that mr. bloomberg resisted or blocked. yet mr. bloomberg also put his shoulder against inequality; history just takes its time telling unexpected truths. he said the city's economy could not rely simply on wall street, because it would always go through downturns. the city used tax cuts to lure back the film and television industry, which had taken many of its good-paying union jobs to toronto. it developed land north of bellevue hospital center along the east river into a biotechnology center that is now 310,000 square feet of lab space. construction has started on a two-million-square-foot campus on roosevelt island for graduate engineering studies that will be run by cornell university and technion-israel institute of technology. the city encouraged the expansion of three other universities for technology research and study. in its first 400 years of european settlement, new york grew because its superb natural harbor made it a hub for trade and manufacturing. with the decline of the waterfront and factories toward the end of the 20th century, new york needed new advantages. it depended heavily on the finance, insurance and real estate sectors fire for short which was good for high-wage earners, and created a service and retail economy for people at the other end of the ladder. but with every bad downturn, the whole city was knocked around. the efforts to diversify worked, as a front-page article in the new york times on monday noted. \"you've got to play to the strength of the city as an idea capital,\" said john sexton, the president of new york university. the city's strongest assets, he argued, were intellectual, cultural and educational . mr. bloomberg held similar views, said seth pinsky, who was a senior mayoral adviser on economic development. \"in the 21st century, the most important natural resource a city can have is its talent base,\" mr. pinsky said. \"companies and businesses are going to follow talent.\" the vibrant cultural life, and the molting of new york's image as a crime-ridden jungle, led to a tourism boom. dozens of hotels have opened, many of them governed by a strong union contract . an uncle to julian soto, reynaldo soto, who has been working since he was 16, said he made $10 an hour working overnight in a kmart a few years ago. now 26, he got a union job last year at the lucerne on the upper west side with a base salary of $50,000. \"plus all the overtime i need,\" he said. nearly two million new yorkers fall below the official definition of poverty, and about the same number are close to it. but \"a tale of two cities\"? that's an undercount. there have to be 20 or 30 other ones, in plain sight, with plenty to teach us.",

        "abstract": "the environmental protection agency said tuesday that it had granted california the right to enforce its first-in-the-nation standards controlling greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and light trucks. the move reverses a 2008 ruling by the bush administration and effectively ends a seesaw political battle between automakers and environmental regulators that began in sacramento eight years ago when the california legislature first took up the issue. lisa p. jackson, the e.p.a. administrator, said in an interview that she had reversed the ruling by her predecessor , stephen l. johnson, because the traditional presumption had been that california, with its history of air pollution, had grounds to establish rules that exceed federal requirements. \"the burden is on those that object,\" ms. jackson said. the immediate impact of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is more symbolic than practical. the 2009 fleet of new vehicles is already in compliance with the california rules and the 2010 fleet is also expected to meet the requirements, said tom cackette, deputy director of california's air resources board. \"auto manufacturers have been making changes to vehicles both because they anticipated they might have to meet california standards and because there was a general interest in public in buying more efficient cars,\" mr. cackette said. nationally, about one-third of the greenhouse-gas emissions contributing to climate change come from the transportation sector , most of it from cars and light trucks. the rules in california will cut emissions from new vehicles by 14 percent from 2008 levels in 2011. thirteen states and the district of columbia have also adopted the california rules in an effort to combat climate change. california's emissions rules are also expected to be congruent with new federal fuel economy standards announced in may by the obama administration. both standards envision that emissions will be cut by 30 percent in 2016. the aligning of california's rules and the federal mileage standards is intended to ensure that automakers comply with a single standard. this \"moves us toward a policy that ensures that consumers in all 50 states have access to highly fuel-efficient vehicles at an affordable price,\" said dave mccurdy, president and chief executive of the alliance of automobile manufacturers . carmakers have accepted the fuel economy and emission standards that they long opposed, at a time when their industry is in crisis and accepting billions of dollars in federal money. in the interview, ms. jackson of the e.p.a. praised fran pavley, the state senator from california who originally crafted the early blueprint for the state standards in 2001. ms. pavley was jubilant tuesday. \"it took eight years, multiple federal courts, the u.s. supreme court, two presidents, two governors and a partridge in a pear tree,\" she said in an interview. \"what a difference that last presidential election made.\"",

        "abstract": "the state police and the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals took over the farm of the prominent new york thoroughbred breeder and owner ernie paragallo on wednesday, saying he had neglected more than 170 horses under his care. multiple charges of animal cruelty are pending against paragallo in greene county; each count carries a punishment of up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. the police entered paragallo's center brook farm in climax, n.y., about 11 a.m. with two veterinarians, said ron perez, president of the humane society/s.p.c.a. for columbia and greene counties . \"veterinarians looked at about 40 horses, and all were in poor shape and several hundred pounds underweight,\" perez said. \"it's really bad. it's the worst i've ever seen in a thoroughbred situation. the animals themselves are in horrific condition. it's a sad, sad scene.\" joe mahoney, a spokesman for the new york state racing & wagering board, which had an agent at the farm during the raid, said all of the horses ages 1 to 20 years old showed signs of various stages of malnutrition . in addition, according to mahoney, the veterinarians on site said the horses had lacked proper veterinarian care, vaccinations and suitable shelter. the care, rehabilitation and feeding of the horses on the farm now fall to perez's group. perez described the horses as showing bones and being parasitic with skin infections and untreated injuries to their eyes and feet. perez said there was some food on the farm, but not enough for that many horses. his group ordered 500 small bales and 20 larger round bales of hay that will be delivered thursday, perez said. bedding was also ordered for the 25 mares on the farm who are in foal. \"that will get us through a few days it's going to cost us a fortune to get these horses back in shape,\" perez said. paragallo was not at the farm during the surprise raid. when reached by telephone wednesday, he said he had not been to the farm in eight or nine months. \"i'm negligent for not being there,\" he said. \"but i thought i was providing for them.\" he said he had spoken to a state police officer wednesday and would meet with the police on his farm friday. \"i know the horses were fed,\" he said. \"i don't know what they constitute animal cruelty. i hope they are being fed because i've got the bills and i know i'm paying for it.\" perez said he did not know when the cruelty charges would be filed. \"our first priority is taking care of these horses,\" he said. meanwhile, colleen segarra, who removed two horses from the farm saturday and filed a police complaint wednesday about the dire condition of other horses on the farm, went to a cornell university veterinary center for emergency treatment with one of those horses now in her care. the horse, a colt who will be 1 year old on april 28, weighed 364 pounds, or nearly half the normal weight for a yearling. \"he is in very, very bad shape and may not make it past today,\" said segarra, a member of equine rescue resource , which is caring for the yearling as well as his mother, who was also taken off the farm saturday. the new york state racing & wagering board has also opened an investigation of paragallo. on tuesday the board issued a subpoena that will require paragallo, a licensed authorized agent in new york who is associated with paraneck stable, to answer questions about the care of his horses. since 1996, paragallo's family-owned paraneck stable has been among the nation's leading racing outfits, starting 4,686 runners who have earned $20.6 million in purses. he owns half of the stallion unbridled's song, who commands a $125,000 stud fee in kentucky . the jockey club released a statement wednesday saying that it supported the investigations and that it would not recognize any of paragallo's horses if he is found guilty of animal cruelty, which would effectively end his career as a thoroughbred owner and breeder. in the past week, several individuals and rescue groups have shed light on the poor condition of horses under his care. last month, four undernourished and neglected former racehorses belonging to paragallo were rescued from a new york kill pen en route to slaughter. they were among more than 20 horses from paragallo's farm that were sold to slaughter for $680. a horse transporter, richie baiardi, said that he had picked them up at paragallo's farm at the end of february with the intention of taking them to florida but could not because they were \"bags of bones, literally walking hides,\" and would not have survived the trip. all four mares are being rehabilitated by another chance 4 horses, a rescue group, at its farm in bernville, pa. three other mares are recovering at a boarding and training center in fulton, n.y., operated by lisa leogrande, who discovered the horses in the kill pen.",

he noted the sectarian violence without bringing up the years of fear that gripped the united states and the rest of the world back in 2004, 2005 and 2006, when it looked as if the american invasion of iraq would engulf an already volatile region. \"we remember the early days the american units that streaked across the sands and skies of iraq,\" mr. obama said. \"in battles from nasiriya to karbala to baghdad, american troops broke the back of a brutal dictator in less than a month.\" and yet, mr. obama said, \"we know too well the heavy costs\" of the iraq war: \"nearly 4,500 americans have made the ultimate sacrifice, including 202 fallen heroes from here at fort bragg. 202.\" the speech was the latest in a series of public appearances orchestrated by the white house to signal the end of the conflict and to drive home the point that mr. obama fulfilled one of his 2008 presidential campaign promises. at times somber, at times ebullient there were plenty of \"hooahs\" during his speech the president tried to project an understanding of what the people, who have seen their family members go off to fight a war that most americans came to oppose, have been through. \"there have been missed birthday parties and graduations,\" mr. obama said. \"there are bills to pay and jobs that have to be juggled with picking up the kids. for every soldier that goes on patrol, there are the husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters praying that they come back.\" mr. obama made the trip to fort bragg, his first since taking office, as both the commander in chief who has brought soldiers home and as a presidential candidate. he brought along his wife, michelle, who has been working with veterans' families since mr. obama took office. at times, the visit seemed like a campaign swing. while he eschewed any of the usual criticism of republicans and never even mentioned the names of either of the front-runners in the republican primaries, newt gingrich or mitt romney , mr. obama spent a long 20 minutes after his speech pressing the flesh. he plunged deep into the crowd of army fatigues and burgundy berets signifying that soldiers are attached to air-borne units seeming determined to shake hands with each and everyone there. mr. obama's campaign advisers see north carolina, a traditionally red state that mr. obama unexpectedly won in 2008, as a potential key to the president's re-election path.but fort bragg and neighboring fayetteville, with its large african-american population full of veterans of iraq and afghanistan , will need to join urban areas like charlotte , greensboro and raleigh - durham in turning out for mr. obama if the president is to have a chance of repeating that unlikely victory next year. on tuesday, jim messina, mr. obama's campaign manager, presented reporters with a slide show mapping out several obama pathways to victory next year. one crucial path, he said, included winning north carolina and virginia both states that john kerry lost in 2004, but that mr. obama won in 2008. already, the obama campaign has opened up operations in north carolina, and it is banking on the state's changed demographics, including an influx of young, college-educated people. the obama campaign is also hoping for high turnout among african-americans, who make up 22 percent of the state's population and 41 percent of fayetteville's population. charlotte will host the democratic national convention next september. meanwhile, mitt romney has already taken out television advertisements here in north carolina, including one that ran this week, targeting mr. obama's handling of the economy. mr. obama has been working hard to get credit for ending the iraq war, a promise that was a centerpiece of his 2008 campaign. but it remains to be seen whether his successful completion of his promise to end the war will have much resonance next year, as the country continues to struggle through the fragile economic recovery. fort bragg is home to a variety of troops, including the army special operations, the 18th airborne corps and the 82nd airborne division. fort bragg soldiers have been in the thick of the fighting in the iraqi theater from day 1 of the american invasion in 2003. \"for all of the challenges that our nation faces, you remind us that there's nothing that we americans can't do when we stick together,\" mr. obama said. \"it's why the united states military is the most respected institution in our land. it's why you, the 9/11 generation, have earned your place in history.\" he concluded with \"i am proud of you.\"",

        "title": "mcdonald's tweaks its recipes: now, real butter in the mcmuffin.",
        "abstract": "oak brook, ill. mcdonald's long shied away from talking about how it makes the food on its menu and what is in that food. the company is now being open and loud about it. at an event monday at its headquarters here, mcdonald's announced several changes to its ingredients, including eliminating artificial preservatives from some breakfast foods and chicken mcnuggets, its most popular food item, and removing high-fructose corn syrup from its buns. such changes, together with its decision in 2015 to buy only chicken raised without antibiotics used to treat humans, affect almost half of the food on mcdonald's menu, the company said. the moves are the latest in a series by the company to address changing demands by consumers, who have pushed food companies and restaurants to provide more healthy options and fewer artificial ingredients. it is also an effort to play defense against numerous competitors who promote the quality and freshness of their foods. mike andres, president of mcdonald's u.s.a., said that over the last few years, the company took a hard look at its foods and how they were prepared. the ingredients it was using, like artificial preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup, had good reasoning behind them but consumers disliked them. \"why take a position to defend them if consumers are saying they don't want them?\" mr. andres said on monday. jessica foust, director of culinary innovation at mcdonald's, hosted a group of reporters in a test kitchen to show how some of the changes will work in practice. on the table in front of her were the five ingredients that go into an egg mcmuffin: an english muffin, a large egg, a slice of canadian bacon, mcdonald's proprietary american cheese and butter no longer liquid margarine. the margarine used to be squirted out of a plastic bottle. the butter the company will use has to be softened but not melted, then blended to maintain its flavor and consistency. the change took six months. \"you have to be careful with butter,\" ms. foust said. \"we're really cooking with real ingredients.\" other changes, like getting artificial preservatives out of chicken mcnuggets, were easier all the company had to do was take the preservative out of the oil it cooked them in. that change has been made. the changes to the buns will happen this month. marion gross, senior vice president for supply chain at mcdonald's, said the sheer volume of ingredients that mcdonald's needs every day made it difficult to change quickly. so the company is increasingly testing new products and ingredients in regional markets, which allows it to develop larger supply chains over time. it is, for instance, testing latino-inspired breakfast bowls in southern california, like an egg white scramble with sauteed baby spinach and kale, and a scrambled egg with cheese and chicken chorizo, garnished with mcdonald's hash browns. many of the new ingredients it is starting to buy, like cage-free eggs and antibiotic-free chicken, are more expensive. but ms. gross said that would not cause prices to rise. \"we are confident we can offset the premium,\" she said. mcdonald's is determined to continue to keep its prices steady, mr. andres said, noting that the costs of its major commodities like beef and chicken are down this year. after a rough patch, the company has regained its financial footing in recent quarters, helped in large part by making many of its breakfast menu items available throughout the day. but the growth from that change appears to be slowing down, putting pressure on the company to find new ways to increase sales. in its second quarter, the company reported that sales in stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, grew just 1.8 percent in the united states, less than investment analysts had expected. globally, same-store sales rose 3.1 percent. earnings were flat at $1.09 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in the same period a year earlier. one of the ways to get more customers, mr. andres said on monday, is to talk more openly about foods in an effort to change consumer attitudes toward mcdonald's. \"we're going to continue to follow up and continue to inform customers we told you we were going to do this, and here's where we are on that,\" he said. for instance, the company announced that all of its chicken would be antibiotic-free by 2017, but on monday, it said it had already reached that goal. \"we're proud of the changes we're making,\" mr. andres said.",

        "title": "investors rush to beat threat of higher taxes.",
        "abstract": "business owners and investors are rapidly maneuvering to shield themselves from the prospect of higher taxes next year, a strategy that is sending ripples across wall street and broad areas of the economy. take steve wynn, the casino magnate, who has been a vocal critic of higher tax rates. he and his fellow shareholders in wynn resorts, the company announced, will collect a special dividend of $750 million on tuesday, a payout timed to take advantage of current rates. experts estimated that taking the payout this year instead of next could save mr. wynn, who owns a sizable stake in the company, more than $20 million. for the wealthy like mr. wynn, the overriding goal is to record as much of their future income this year as they can. this includes moves as diverse as sales of businesses, one-time dividends and the sale of stocks that have been big winners. \"in my 30 years in practice, i've never seen such a flood of desire and action to transfer a business and cash out,\" said kenneth k. bezozo, a partner in new york with the law firm haynes and boone. \"we're seeing a watershed event.\" whether small business owners or individuals saving for retirement, investors are being urged by their advisers to reconsider their holdings. along the way, many are shedding the very investments that have been the most popular over the last year, contributing to recent sell-offs in formerly high-flying shares like apple and amazon. investors typically take profits in their own portfolio at year-end, but the selling appears to be more targeted this year. stocks with large dividends, for instance, are seen as less attractive because of the perceived likelihood of a sharp increase in the tax rate on dividends. all this is weighing on the broader financial markets, as worries mount about the economic drag from the combination of higher tax rates and reduced government spending set for january if president obama and senate republicans cannot reach a budget compromise before then. fears about the fiscal impasse in washington, along with anxiety about fading corporate profits and weakening economies abroad, have pushed the benchmark standard & poor's 500-stock index down about 5 percent since the election. on friday, major stock indexes had their best showing of the week after president obama and republican leaders signaled that a compromise was possible. even if many of the tax breaks scheduled to expire survive a new budget deal, some business owners and investors are bracing for substantial increases in specific areas of the tax code. the top rate on dividends, for example, could climb to 39.6 percent from 15 percent if no action is taken. capital gains taxes, which now top out at 15 percent, could rise above 20 percent, many financial advisers say. most investment income will also be subject to a 3.8 percent charge to help pay for president obama's health care law . stocks that pay big dividends have been popular in recent years among investors eager for an alternative to the meager returns on bank savings accounts and treasury securities . since october, though, the two sectors that provide the most generous dividend payments utilities and telecommunication stocks have been among the worst performers, hurt also in part by the devastation of hurricane sandy on the east coast. utility companies in the s.& p. 500 have fallen 9.4 percent from their highs in october. telecommunication stocks in the index have dropped 11.3 percent from theirs, compared with the broader index's 6.8 percent decline from its recent high. john moorin, the founder of a medical equipment company near indianapolis, said he sold about $650,000 in dividend-paying stocks like mcdonald's and coca-cola a few days after the election, worried about the potential increase in taxes. \"i love these companies, but i'm so scared that now all of the sudden i'm going to get taxed at such a rate with them that they won't be worth anything,\" mr. moorin said. although mr. wynn has declared special dividends at the end of the year before most recently in 2011 in a call with analysts last month, he hinted that higher taxes would cause him and other chief executives to rethink big payouts in future years. in the meantime, he added, it was \"very difficult to do long-range planning with a government that moves as much as this does on so many issues.\" leggett & platt, a diversified manufacturer based in carthage, mo., decided to move up payment of its fourth-quarter dividend to december from january so shareholders could take advantage of the lower rate. \"if we can help our shareholders avoid taxes and keep more of their dividends, we'll do it,\" said david m. desonier, senior vice president for corporate strategy and investor relations. while negotiators are trying to find ways to raise more revenue for the long term, some experts expect a substantial bump in tax collections in the short term as investors take a multitude of steps now that they would have taken in future years. after the top tax rate on capital gains rose to 28 percent from 20 percent at the end of 1986, federal receipts from such gains doubled to $52.9 billion in 1987, as sales surged at the end of the previous tax year. the potential jump in tax rates has been telegraphed for months, but many investors say they did not respond sooner because they were waiting to see if mitt romney would defeat the president and move forward with his commitment to keep rates at current levels. president obama, since defeating mr. romney, has continued his call for an increase in marginal tax rates on the wealthy. a growing number of republican leaders have conceded that some increase is now likely. kristina collins, a chiropractor in mclean, va., said she and her husband planned to closely monitor the business income from their joint practice to avoid crossing the income threshold for higher taxes outlined by president obama on earnings above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples. ms. collins said she felt torn by being near the cutoff line and disappointed that federal tax policy was providing a disincentive to keep expanding a business she founded in 1998. \"if we're really close and it's near the end-year, maybe we'll just close down for a while and go on vacation,\" she said. of the potential changes in the tax code set to take place on jan. 1, the scheduled increase in the tax rate on capital gains would hit a particularly broad range of investments. business owners, for instance, can lock in the current top rate of 15 percent on capital gains if they sell their company before the end of the year. the capital gains tax also applies to increases in the value of stocks and other securities, encouraging some investors to sell holdings that have done well. this is one of several factors cited in the recent plunge in the price of apple shares. they have dropped 26 percent since mid-september after rising 73 percent earlier in the year. the coming changes have not hurt all assets. municipal bonds have become more attractive because they are exempt from most federal taxes, including the new surcharge related to president obama's health care law. frank fantozzi, a financial planner in cleveland, is recommending that his wealthy clients increase their allocation to municipal bonds from around 30 percent to about 40 percent. but the potential effect of the scheduled tax increases and government spending cuts has been mostly negative. many market strategists have suggested trimming overall holdings of risky assets like stocks, and business executives are proceeding very cautiously. some business owners say they are holding off on hiring plans because they expect tax rates to rise. dyke messinger, chief executive of power curbers in salisbury, n.c., said he would like to fill four slots at his construction equipment company but would only hire three people because he anticipated that his tax bill would rise by $100,000. \"it's not a huge amount of money,\" mr. messinger said. \"but it's enough money that you don't want to make a misstep.\"",

        "title": "new yorkers recall reverend ike, who inspired spiritual and financial betterment.",
        "abstract": "it was an attempt at business as usual at the weekly service on sunday at the palace cathedral in washington heights, a former movie theater that now serves as the home of the christ community united church. and knowing the beliefs of the church's founder, the rev. frederick j. eikerenkoetter ii, better known as reverend ike, who espoused a business-oriented, money-is-the-root-of-all-good approach to spiritual affairs, that effort was probably welcome. reverend ike died last tuesday. \"we are going to keep on learning and keep on prospering,\" said the rev. james wyns as he began his sermon, echoing the printed announcement handed to parishioners encouraging them not to mourn the passing of reverend ike, as he was better known, but to celebrate his existence. but it was not always so easy for the 50 people gathered in the cavernous space, whose columns, ceilings and stairway balustrades are colored a deep, lustrous gold, to maintain their composure. indeed, charmaine yates, who sang backed by a drummer and a chair-rumbling organist, could not complete her first sentence. \"i don't want to talk too long because \" ms. yates said, before breaking down in tears, though she eventually finished her thought. \"i thank god for him and his family for teaching me i am worth something.\" reverend ike, who along with jim bakker, jimmy swaggart and pat robertson was one of the first evangelists to use television to reach large-scale audiences, offered spiritual inspiration through sermons, books and cd packages sold on his web site for up to $89.95. in return, the reverend requested cash donations from his parishioners, from his television and radio audiences, and from the recipients of his extensive mailings. later, during the more than three-hour service on sunday, a photo projected on one of two pull-down movie screens of a smiling reverend ike in a white suit, with a finger pointing to a passage on a page of an open bible, seemed to be too much for some parishioners. fibbie harris, a retired school teacher from yonkers, became so overcome with emotion that she had to get up, cheeks wet with tears, and walk to the lobby. \"i do love him so much. i've been kissing a photo of his face at home,\" said ms. harris, who has been coming to the palace cathedral since 1972, soon after reverend ike bought the boarded-up movie house. although reverend ike's books gave ms. harris strength to raise two children after her husband died, she said, it was his message about financial empowerment that really struck a chord, inspiring her to go back to school and get a teaching degree. \"you've got to learn to think for yourself,\" ms. harris said, saying that reverend ike's followers were the opposite of jim jones's adherents, who committed mass suicide in guyana in 1978. in recent years, the theater on 175th street, which has a capacity of 3,300, has hosted graduations, fashion shows and rock concerts under its rococo filigrees, including performances by modest mouse, arcade fire and neil young. presumably, the venue will continue to hold such functions under the leadership of the rt. rev. xavier f. eikerenkoetter , reverend ike's son. in fact, on nov. 6 an event called \"monsters of folk\" is scheduled. not everybody in attendance on sunday swore by reverend ike's self-reliant god-with-mammon philosophy, which can seem to some a mix of opinions straight from the mouths of both stuart smalley, the self-help-obsessed character played by senator al franken in his \"saturday night live\" days, and jim cramer, the high-octane investment-tips-exhorting host on cnbc. in fact, bilal whitest, 46, a professional percussionist from paramus, n.j., had simply come to pay respects to his old boss. reverend ike had hired him to play drums for sunday services for five years in the 1990s. whitest spoke about those years on sunday as he stood in front of a scuffed glass case, from behind which visitors could buy books like \"health, joy and prosperity for you!\" nearby, bottles of vitamins were for sale. but sitting up there behind his snare drum, he said, he could not help picking up a few financial pointers from time to time. \"he talked about planning, about how to invest,\" he said. \"he was really good about financial betterment.\"",

        "abstract": "las vegas the state of nevada recently joined the crowded bidding to be named a federal test site for the commercial use of pilotless aircraft under a program that will allow as many as six states to test the controversial but potentially lucrative technology for a five-year period. nevada is hoping that its vast open spaces, powerful databanks and experience with military drones will help it stand out among the 37 states bidding for approval from the federal aviation administration to test the commercial uses of drones. the amount of time and resources nevada and the other states are dedicating to the effort shows the potential they see for getting an economic lift from a market that by some predictions may grow to $11 billion in the next decade, or nearly twice its current size. the six sites will give the f.a.a. information on how drones can be used safely in domestic airspace, data the agency needs as it prepares to meet a 2015 deadline for issuing guidelines on the technology. the agency now grants permission to fly drones on a case-by-case basis. for the states that are selected, the hope is that they will become more attractive to big and small companies interested in the expanding market. steve hill, executive director of the nevada governor's office of economic development, said the application was important for nevada, which has led the nation in unemployment, foreclosures and bankruptcies most of the time since the height of the recession. the state is suited for testing drones, he said, because it has \"largest amount of restricted airspace without commercial aircraft.\" \"you could basically fly from the south to the north end of the state or about 300 nautical miles,\" he said. mr. hill also pointed to the state's 25 years in military research and development with drones in the deserts north of las vegas. alan gertler, vice president at the desert research institute , is part of the team preparing the state's application. he said drones could be used to help identify sources of geothermal energy or minerals, and to monitor chemical and biological systems. \"it's a state-of-the-art research tool,\" mr. gertler said. the technology could also be used for weather and climate research, and to monitor natural disasters like forest fires, mr. hill said. nevada began the application process in late february, along with 49 other applicants from 37 states. the f.a.a. will decide on the six finalists by the end of the year. however the winners wind up using the technology, the federal government will be following each site closely to gather information for developing guidelines on safely integrating unmanned aircraft into the nation's airspace by sept. 30, 2015. but even those guidelines are likely to be revised as the technology continues to develop, an f.a.a. official said. the federal government is also seeking public comment until april 23 about how to safeguard the privacy of people on the ground near the test sites. in nevada, the public outcry has been muted, thus far. allen lichtenstein, general counsel for the american civil liberties union of nevada , said, \"the concern isn't the drones themselves, it's their use, like any other tool.\" he said the group was following the process closely and hoped to see \"strict guidelines\" on their use. mr. hill said nevada might have another advantage in the competition: senator harry reid, the top democrat in the senate. \"obviously it helps to have the majority leader from your state,\" mr. hill said, noting that mr. reid helped set up a meeting last august between several members of the state's application team and the f.a.a. administrator, michael p. huerta, when mr. huerta was in las vegas for an annual conference. ben gielow, government relations manager for the association for unmanned vehicle systems international, a nonprofit trade group, said similar meetings had taken place between officials from other states and top f.a.a. officials. \"it shows the high-level importance of this technology and the opportunity to test it,\" he said.",

        "abstract": "seoul, south korea as he was confessing to crimes that would lead to his execution , the doomed uncle of north korea's leader suggested that he hoped the country's many economic woes would drive the military to overthrow the kim dynasty, the state-run news agency said. the statement, if true, was shocking for a country that normally hides any hint of disloyalty, has not publicized a coup attempt in decades and has not released a detailed explanation of a purge to its people much less to the world. but even if the uncle, jang song-thaek, did not utter such treason, the laundry list of alleged crimes the north koreans published is notable for its admission of instability in the hermetic nation and suggests that at least some see flaws in its debilitated state-run economy. \"i was going to stage the coup by using army officers who had close ties with me or by mobilizing armed forces under the control of my confidants,\" the north's korean central news agency on friday quoted mr. jang as having said during his court-martial. \"i thought the army might join in the coup if the living of the people and service personnel further deteriorate in the future.\" as analysts scrambled friday to make sense of the execution many had doubted that the leader, kim jong-un, would kill a relative and the highly unusual way the news rolled out, they advanced myriad theories for why mr. kim killed the man who was supposed to be his mentor. the biggest divide was whether the purge suggested mr. kim had fully taken charge of his country two years after his father's death or, instead, was severely weakened by the reported betrayal. most officials and experts cautioned that the opaque inner-workings of the north korean government were notoriously hard to analyze. still, many of them said the demise of mr. jang, considered a champion of chinese-style economic reform, could set back such efforts. and they said that nuclear-armed north korea appeared to be mired in an intense power struggle over economic and other policies that could become bloodier if mr. kim turns his ire on those referred to in the north korean report as mr. jang's \"followers.\" \"if kim jong-un was sure of his control of power, he would not have needed to execute his uncle,\" said lee byong-chul, a senior fellow at the institute for peace and cooperation in seoul. \"there will be big and small bloody purges, and at a time like this, desperate extremists may lash out. pyongyang is no longer safe.\" on friday, north korea hinted at such retaliation by condemning \"undesirable and alien elements\" in \"important posts of the party and state,\" in \"ministries and national institutions,\" and in agencies dealing with foreign trade. it also indicated that a purge might reach the north's powerful military and the secret police, saying that mr. jang had worked to \"stretch his tentacles even to the people's army.\" mr. jang, 67, was executed thursday immediately after being convicted of treason, north korea said. suh sang-kee, a governing party lawmaker in seoul, quoted south korean intelligence officials as saying that he was likely killed by a machine-gun firing squad. according to the north korean state news agency, mr. jang had built a \"little kingdom\" of his own in the ruling worker's party. mr. jang dreamed of first becoming premier \"when the economy goes totally bankrupt,\" then solving \"the problem of people's living at a certain level\" by spending an enormous amount of funds he had stashed away, the report said. image a train rider in seoul watches a report on the uncle of kim jong-un. credit ahn young-joon/associated press \"jang dreamed such a foolish dream that once he seizes power by a base method, his despicable true colors as 'reformist' known to the outside world would help his 'new government' get 'recognized' by foreign countries in a short span of time,\" it said. the state-directed economy has been falling apart for years, especially since the soviet union collapsed and stopped propping it up with subsidized fuel and other aid. mr. jang was considered a force behind new efforts to open up special economic zones that would give preferential treatment for chinese and other investors. some experts say mr. kim, or hard-liners influencing him, might have worried about giving away too much to china, even though the country is the north's benefactor, or about mr. jang and his allies cashing in on the growing trade with china; mr. kim has indirectly criticized selling north korean minerals too cheaply to china. analysts said it was possible for the north to have faked or exaggerated the charges against mr. jang to keep him from posing a challenge to mr. kim's power. but they also noted how unusual it was for the ruling family to pull back the curtain on its machinations. \"although high-ranking leaders, including members of the kim family, have been deposed before, we haven't seen anything this public or dramatic since kim jong-un's grandfather kim il-sung purged his last major rivals in the late 1950s,\" said prof. charles k. armstrong , a north korea expert at columbia university and the author of \"tyranny of the weak: north korea and the world, <phone>.\" \"this seems to indicate the divisions within the kim regime were more serious than previously thought,\" professor armstrong said. kim yong-hyun, a north korea expert at dongguk university in seoul, said the 30-year-old mr. kim had declared an end to his father's era with the execution. \"and he did it with a bang, sort of a shock therapy against anyone who still might have doubts about his authority. the speedy way he did it actually shows his daring and confidence.\" but other analysts had lingering questions about who was running the country behind mr. kim. mr. jang \"was the kim family regime's no. 1 revenue generator,\" said john s. park, a northeast asia security specialist at the harvard kennedy school of government, adding that that revenue \"went directly into kim family slush funds.\" chang yong-seok, a senior researcher at the institute for peace and unification studies at seoul national university, said mr. jang was \"the only one in the north who could talk about economic change.\" \"so, when i heard of mr. jang's execution, my first thought was that it was a death notice for those of us who have hoped for economic reform in the north.\"",

        "title": "a desert cold and wet multiplies the misery of syrian refugees.",
        "abstract": "zaatari, jordan the water has mostly been removed from hundreds of flooded tents and the dirt paths that run between them here in the region's vastest camp of syrian refugees. the clotheslines are laden with soggy sweaters and socks, waiting for the sun after a week of harsh wind, rain and snow. the residents are waiting, too: for the next storm, and the next, that they know will come this winter and also, many fear, for their own demise. \"we were waiting for our deaths so we came out, but we found our second deaths here,\" said a man who identified himself as abu tarik from the dhulash family. he said he arrived in the zaatari refugee camp 10 days ago after intense shelling near his home and farm, which lie across the border in dara'a, syria. \"there, we were going to die from the fires,\" he said, sitting on a mat surrounded by a dozen family members. \"here we're going to die from the cold. we don't want to die in this tent.\" with aid agencies expecting the number of syrian refugees to reach one million this year, and estimates for the cost of caring for them topping $1 billion, the misery in this struggling six-month-old camp is part of a deepening humanitarian crisis that threatens to destabilize the middle east further. more than half a million people who have already fled syria have ended up in camps and villages across jordan, turkey and lebanon, all of which have asked for more international aid. last week was the worst yet in zaatari, as scores of tents collapsed under the most severe storm in 20 years. two babies and a 22-year-old amputee died, all of unrelated causes. several aid workers were injured when a riot broke out during food distribution. life began to return to normal on friday, but normal in this desert camp of nine square miles crowded with more than 50,000 people is, according to the refugees and even some of those running the place, somewhere between horrible and inhumane. barefoot children trod through mud in temperatures not far above freezing. people lined up for hours for pots, utensils and buckets. women pushed squeegees through the remaining puddles, and washed clothes in plastic tubs with cold water that quickly turned brown. a young man got a $3 shave and haircut in a corrugated tin shack that a refugee barber had set up four days before. a younger one shinnied up a 30-foot light pole to pirate electricity. image aid agencies expect the number of syrian refugees to reach 1 million in 2013, and estimates for the cost of caring for them top $1 billion. credit the new york times \"there's no silver lining on such harsh conditions,\" acknowledged andrew harper, the top official of the united nations refugee agency in jordan. \"it's just a really, really bad place to be.\" but mr. harper said the united nations and the nonprofit groups helping it run the camp were doing the best with what they had, noting that the agency had appealed for $245 million to absorb syrians regionwide in 2012 and received $157 million. jordan, already consumed with an intense financial crisis and a growing protest movement, is scrambling to keep up with the influx. its task is particularly complex given the delicate balance in its population of six million, which is dominated by palestinian refugees and their descendants and includes hundreds of thousands who fled the war in iraq. zaatari is only the most visible challenge. nearly five times as many refugees are living in jordanian cities and villages, taxing the government's resources, and competing for scarce jobs. anmar hmoud, who is handling the syria file for the prime minister, said that refugees could leave zaatari and jordan's handful of smaller camps if a relative or friend could guarantee financial support, but that the government was \"exhausting its own resources.\" he estimated the cost of military, health, education and other services at $670 million for 2012 and 2013. \"we are a neighbor, and we do our duty, but there is a limit to helping people unless we are helped by others,\" he said. \"it's not the jordanian problem, it is the international community's problem.\" some relief is coming. mr. hmoud said a new camp just south of here near zarqa, financed by the united arab emirates, would open in two weeks, allowing 6,000 of zaatari's most vulnerable residents to move into prefabricated homes, and eventually growing to accommodate 30,000. saudi arabia, which over the past month has provided zaatari with 2,500 prefabs costing $8 million, announced friday that it would give $10 million more to the jordanian effort. mr. harper said he had met with envoys from qatar and the emirates. \"it's terrible to say, but sometimes it takes a miserable situation like we're having now to get people to say, 'yes, we can do something,' \" mr. harper said. not soon enough for iman qardah, 30, who has been in the camp for 10 weeks with her five children, ages 1 to 10. when the storm struck last week, her husband spent the night hammering the stakes of the tent as the wind threatened to rip it from the ground. the next night, rain seeped inside, so the family slept piled on one side. the next, the tent \"started swimming on the water,\" she recalled, and finally collapsed. \"my husband started shouting in the street for someone to help.\" the family moved to a prefab that is perhaps 10 feet by 20 feet. but they leak, too. on friday, the children huddled for warmth around a gas burner where ms. qardah was simmering cauliflower and rice, as a bucket nearby caught drops from the ceiling. a neighbor poked a head in, wondering jealously how she had procured a space heater. \"every day i'm thinner than the day before and my mind is more preoccupied,\" ms. qardah said as she nursed the baby. \"i used to not sleep because of the missiles. now i don't sleep because i'm worried about my kids constantly.\" syrian camp faces storm's aftermath 13 photos view slide show \" image rina castelnuovo for the new york times the camp is rife with complaints. skimpy food rations, scarce clothes. spotty electricity, rare hot water, squalid toilets. suspicions that aid workers are stealing blankets. nothing to do, no prospects for getting out. but given the weather and the continued flood of refugees about 10,000 had arrived in the camp in the past 10 days it is remarkable things are not much, much worse. officials said there had been no casualties from the cold. khaled al-hariri, the 22-year-old who was described in a youtube video posted wednesday by a syrian activist as \"the martyr to negligence and cold,\" actually died of cancer in a nearby hospital, according to a spokesman for the world health organization. there was also a stillbirth and a premature baby who died after three days in an incubator. anne, the doctor at the french military clinic here, which requires personnel to be identified only by first name, said she had seen a slight uptick in sore throats and ears since the storm, but no frostbite. the main change is that patients linger in the consultation tent to stay out of the cold. the french have performed 192 surgical operations on war wounded in the camp. an organization called gynecologists without borders has delivered 172 babies here, 46 in the last three weeks. yusef mohamed hasan was at the clinic on friday holding sham, who was born dec. 12 by caesarean section. she was swaddled in four layers, then cradled in a big fuzzy blanket as her mother had the stitches removed. \"as soon as my wife is o.k., we are going back,\" said mr. hasan, 44. \"it's not better for me there; it's not safe. but it's humiliating here.\" talk of returning to syria has increased as conditions have deteriorated, but officials said there had been no marked change in the number heading back across the border. most are resigned to remaining through the winter, or longer. as the sun came out friday, aboud mohamed awad and three neighbors set about building themselves a bathroom. the storm made walking to the shared facilities unbearable, he said, and anyhow they are filthy and crowded. mr. harper of the united nations said the goal was to have one toilet per 20 refugees, but that the reality right now was more like one to 50. mr. awad said he used the profits selling the ground floor of his home in syria to buy corrugated panels and wood for about $100 and hired a $1.50-an-hour laborer, who started by smoothing cement with a pie plate to create a floor. \"we can at least take care of certain things,\" mr. awad said with something like pride. \"we have young girls. it will make us feel more like people.\"",

        "abstract": "washington the white house said on monday that it was exploring new sanctions against syria mostly involving the assets of top officials around president bashar al-assad but officials acknowledged that the country was already under so many sanctions that the united states held little leverage. \"we're talking about a country whose economy is about the size of pittsburgh's,\" said one administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the continuing debate within the administration about the next steps. \"there are things you can do to amp up the volume\" of sanctions, the official said, \"but the financial impact is slim.\" the problem the obama administration faces with syria is similar to those involving north korea and myanmar, which have long been under sanctions. in syria's case, the united states already, in 2006, banned transactions with the commercial bank of syria . in early 2007, it accused four government-related research organizations of working on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and banned transactions with them. but later that year, when israel found a nuclear reactor under construction in the syrian desert and destroyed it in an airstrike, the united states took no further action, in part because the bush administration could not think of any truly effective sanctions. now the obama administration is looking for specific sanctions against individual leaders, though most of their money is probably in europe or lebanon. so far, president obama has stopped well short of calling on mr. assad to step down, or of declaring, as he did of libya's leader, col. muammar el-qaddafi, that mr. assad had lost the moral authority to lead his country. nor, apparently, has the administration been working behind the scenes to ease mr. assad out of office, as in the case of yemen's president, ali abdullah saleh. asked how the administration justified treating mr. assad so differently, jay carney, the president's press secretary, said monday that it was \"up to the people of syria to decide who its leaders should be.\" he tried to differentiate syria in other ways as well. \"libya was, again, a unique situation,\" mr. carney said. \"we had large portions of the country that were out of the control of muammar qaddafi. we had a qaddafi regime that was moving against its own people in a coordinated military fashion and was about to assault a very large city on the promise that it would show\" what colonel qaddafi himself called \"no mercy.\" and, mr. carney continued, \"we had the support of the arab league.\" administration officials say that while they lack many effective economic tools, they believe mr. assad is sensitive to portrayals of his regime as brutal and backward. \"he sees himself as a westernized leader,\" one senior administration official said, \"and we think he'll react if he believes he is being lumped in with brutal dictators.\" recently, the white house stepped up its denunciations of the syrian government, and of mr. assad himself. \"over the course of two months since protests in syria began,\" mr. obama said in a statement on friday, \"the united states has repeatedly encouraged president assad and the syrian government to implement meaningful reforms, but they refuse to respect the rights of the syrian people or be responsive to their aspirations.\" he accused mr. assad of putting \"personal interests ahead of the interests of the syrian people, and resorting to the use of force and outrageous human rights abuses.\"",

        "abstract": "cairo wasfi amin wassef used to buy and sell jewelry from his shop in cairo's vast khan al-khalili bazaar. now he mostly buys it. well into a third year of economic malaise following the overthrow of president hosni mubarak, many ordinary egyptians are selling their most cherished possessions, including heirloom jewelry, to raise cash for a ticket that will let them start a new life abroad. official figures or estimates are not publicly available, but anecdotal evidence suggests emigration is rising. \"the number of people who sell us their gold since the revolution has increased three times,\" mr. wassef said during an interview this month. some are muslims but most are christians, said mr. wassef, a member of egypt's ancient coptic orthodox christian minority. since the ouster of mr. mubarak in february 2011, a growing number of copts, including some of the most successful businessmen, have left egypt or are preparing to do so, fearing persecution by an islamist-controlled government as much as the stagnant economy that is smothering their industries. among the most prominent, the heads of the sawiris family for several months recently ran their business empire from abroad, although senior members of the family returned to egypt on may 3. \"every week i learn of 10 people who are leaving or who have already left,\" mr. wassef said. \"they know that what happened to the sawiris' can happen to them tomorrow.\" coptic christians, who account for no more than 10 percent of egypt's 85 million people, predate the muslim conquest by six centuries and represent the last tile in a former mosaic of egyptian religions, sects and ethnicities. economically, coptic business leaders have punched above their weight, dominating agriculture in the preindustrial age and in modern-era trade, finance and accounting. they have blended well into egypt's millennia-long tapestry of demographic change, which helps explain their resiliency. as munir fakhry abdelnour, a prominent copt who has worked in business, finance and politics, put it: \"there is no coptic quarter in egypt.\" like other arab leaders, mr. mubarak made a point of protecting minority groups to nurture loyal constituencies and patronage systems that he could leverage against his islamist rivals. though secular tension sometimes turned violent during his 30 years in power, it was generally contained by the state security apparatus. since mr. mubarak's overthrow, however, attacks on copts and their institutions have been widely reported. in october 2011, for example, following the burning of a coptic church in upper egypt, security forces clashed with christian protesters: 28 people, mostly copts, were killed. last month, muslim extremists laid siege to egypt's main coptic cathedral in cairo. the assault, which according to witnesses and video footage the police did little to prevent, followed a funeral for five men who died days earlier, in khusus, a small town north of cairo, in clashes with militants. critics blame president mohamed morsi and his government for failing to quell the violence. in an editorial last month , the state-owned al-ahram weekly called the killings at khusus \"a symptom of irresponsibility in high places, of indifference that can lead the state to the verge of collapse,\" while the copts' spiritual leader, pope tawadros ii, accused mr. morsi of \"delinquency\" and \"misjudgments.\" mr. morsi, a longstanding member of the muslim brotherhood who resigned from the group before taking office, issued a statement of regret following the attacks that struck many observers as perfunctory. last week, he pointedly sent a low-level functionary as his representative to the easter mass led by the pope. mingled with the threat of physical violence is the fear among coptic business leaders that they are being singled out for punitive enforcement of the tax code. orascom construction industries , the flagship in the sawiris family business group and the largest publicly traded egyptian company, is alleged by the finance minister to have failed to pay taxes on profit realized from its 2007 sale of a cement unit to the french cement maker lafarge. the charge confounded analysts; egypt has no capital gains tax, they point out, and o.c.i. took the cement company public two months before its sale precisely to benefit from tax incentives aimed at encouraging companies to list their shares. still, in april, o.c.i. announced that it would pay 7 billion egyptian pounds, or $1 billion, to cairo's tax authority and prosecutors promptly lifted a travel ban on the company's chairman, nassef sawiris, and his father, onsi. o.c.i., meanwhile, is pursuing plans announced in january for a share swap with its dutch unit, oci nv, which would effectively shift trading in the company's stock to amsterdam. the telecommunications tycoon naguib sawiris, the eldest and most outspoken of the sawiris brothers, has all but liquidated his assets in egypt. in october 2010, he signed a $6.5 billion deal that merged orascom telecom into the amsterdam-based telecommunications company vimpelcom, which was controlled by the russian investment firm alfa group. hany genena, the head of research at pharos capital, an egyptian investment bank, said mr. sawiris was now selling most of his holdings in orascom telecom media and technology holding, which was created as part of the merger with vimpelcom. cash rich, analysts say, he is in the united states seeking investment opportunities in the country's emerging shale gas industry. mr. sawiris declined requests for an interview for this article. to be sure, coptic business leaders are not the only ones seemingly targeted by what they see as the selective interpretation of tax laws. investors and businessmen regardless of faith complain of drift and inconsistency at the policy-planning level. companies that were privatized during the twilight of the mubarak years are now being considered for renationalization. a new tax law published in december has since been withdrawn. plans to curb costly and wasteful subsidy systems have been postponed or watered down. \"everything is being done on a whim,\" mr. genena said. \"we wonder how we can keep operating like this.\" but the burden of uncertainty rests heaviest on coptic business leaders and investors who by numerous accounts are voting with their feet. rafik beshay, the procurement director at a coptic-owned steel mill, says he is having difficulty finding christians to fill job openings created by the departures as he tries to maintain parity among christian and muslim employees. the caucasus state of georgia is offering citizenship papers to any egyptian copt prepared to directly invest $20,000 there, according to mr. wassef, the jeweler, while the u.s. government has made it easier for copts fleeing religious persecution to settle in america, according to rasha samir, the head of publications at the investment bank efg-hermes in cairo. requests for u.s. visas, she said, which ordinarily take months to process, are now finalized in just two weeks. steve blando, a spokesman for the u.s. department of homeland security which handles asylum requests, denied that there was a policy to fast-track the process for egyptian copts. \"the u.s. asylum system does not make decisions to grant asylum to individuals of a particular nationality,\" mr. blando said. each claim \"is adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, and the applicant must meet each element of the asylum standard in order to establish eligibility for asylum.\" still, in the u.s. fiscal year beginning oct. 1, according to data from the department, the united states had thus far granted 1,417 requests for asylum from egypt, compared with 1,867 for the whole of 2012 and 837 in 2011. at 1,867, last year's figure was nearly six times what it was in the year before mr. mubarak was overthrown.",

        "title": "now on youtube: local news.",
        "abstract": "with its ability to collect articles and sell advertisements against them, google has already become a huge force in the news business and the scourge of many newspapers. now its subsidiary youtube wants to do the same thing to local television. youtube , which already boasts of being \"the biggest news platform in the world,\" has created a news near you feature that senses a user's location and serves up a list of relevant videos. in time, it could essentially engineer a local newscast on the fly. it is already distributing hometown video from dozens of sources, and it wants to add thousands more. youtube says it is helping tv stations and its other partners by creating a new but so far not fiscally significant source of revenue. but news media companies may have reasons to be wary. few tv stations have figured out how replicate profits on the internet. youtube can easily act as another competitor. so for now, most of the youtube videos near you come from nontraditional sources: radio stations, newspapers, colleges and, in the case of a fledgling san francisco outfit called vidsf, three friends who despise the local tv diet of fires and homicides. \"it really levels the playing field,\" said kieran farr, a founder of vidsf who covers the city's culture and uploads his segments to youtube. news near you, started in the spring, is only part of youtube's push into news video. this summer, the company invited the more than 25,000 news sources listed on google news to become video suppliers. the site is also promoting videos from abc news, the associated press, reuters and other outlets. this year, it began featuring breaking news videos including ones submitted by citizens in iran, where protests are being captured by cellphone users on its home page. so far, the localized videos are no replacement for a print or tv diet of news. on sunday, visitors near baltimore saw a news report about a teen assistance program; in chicago they saw a wgn-tv feature about street performers; and in los angeles, they saw a review of an electric motorcycle produced by the los angeles times. producers often count the views in hundreds, not thousands. to date, nearly 200 news outlets have signed up with youtube to post news packages and split the revenue from the advertisements that appear with them. in addition, google searches now show youtube videos alongside news articles, helping the videos reach a wider audience. youtube's sheer breadth it is visited by 100 million americans each month makes it a powerful force for promotion, as well as a potential threat to entrenched media companies. and those companies already have more than enough to worry about: much of the local media marketplace has collapsed in recent years as classified ads have moved online, automakers have curtailed ad spending and news and entertainment options have proliferated. youtube, meanwhile, is still trying to turn a profit nearly three years after it was acquired by google. because copyright concerns prevent it from placing ads on amateur videos, it has striven to sign up professional partners to seed the site with ad-friendly content. news is one obvious option. \"google can only gain by splitting revenue with people who have feet on the street in local markets,\" said terry heaton, a senior vice president at ar&d, a company that advises locally focused media organizations. google said in june that it was pleased with youtube's trajectory and indicated that it expected the site to be profitable in the not-too-distant future, but did not specify when. while youtube can gain by adding local video, it remains to be seen whether established news outlets will benefit. google's scraping of print headlines and links has led some to assign blame to the company for the financial struggles of newspapers. the chief executive of dow jones recently called google a \"digital vampire\" that was \"sucking the blood\" from newspapers by harvesting their free articles. what youtube is doing is somewhat different. it is not sending digital spiders around the web to collect videos automatically; instead, it is asking news outlets to sign up as partners and promising a wider audience for their material. youtube's push to organize local news video began in earnest in the spring when the news near you module was introduced. the module uses the internet address of a visitor's computer to determine the user's location and whether any partners are located within a 100-mile radius. if so, seven days of local videos are displayed. but in many places, namely urban markets, 100 miles can hardly be counted as a local area; steve grove, the head of news and politics for youtube, said, \"we'll get a smaller radius as we bring on more partners.\" mr. grove said about 5 percent of users who see the news near you module watch at least one local news video, a rate that youtube sees as encouraging. \"the relevancy factor kicks into gear,\" he said. \"suddenly these videos actually matter to you because they're about your neighborhood or where you live.\" youtube's arms-wide-open approach forces stations to judge whether youtube is a friend or a foe, echoing a question that newspapers have grappled with for years. (some have deemed google a \"frenemy.\") \"for stations, there won't be significant revenue from youtube in the short term,\" said andy plesser, the editor of the online video site beet.tv. that is partly because few of the videos reach an audience of millions, he said. he also suggested that the local news feature faces resistance from station owners. \"many simply don't see the value of being on youtube,\" he said. in new york, the cable news channel ny1, for instance, said it was concentrating on drawing visitors to its own site, rather than sharing videos elsewhere. \"it's an old conundrum,\" marc nathanson, an executive producer of ny1.com , said. \"when you have valuable content, do you make people come to you for it? or do you put it out there to enhance the brand and hope that users find their way back to you for more?\" he guessed that ny1 would offer some videos on sites like youtube in the future. meanwhile, a new breed of local news broadcasters including ones without broadcasting licenses, the traditional barrier to entry in local markets is emerging online. \"radio stations, newspapers, universities, advocacy organizations, churches and other local groups, and individuals are becoming news producers,\" mr. plesser said. mr. heaton said stations should treat youtube as a marketing machine for their old-fashioned television newscasts. \"as long as google wants to pay for the bandwidth\" to host videos, he said, \"let them.\" mr. grove said youtube had not met \"a ton of resistance\" from news outlets and the main reason there are so few participants is that the initiative is new. mr. grove has stumbled across some local members, including the dallas morning news and the cincinnati enquirer, that he had not even known were on the site. (any internet user can create a youtube account and start uploading videos free.) the new york times created a youtube channel in 2006 and has posted more than 1,300 videos on it, essentially highlighting some of the content on its own web site. national news, too, is being curated by the site. the \"top headlines\" section of the site collects videos from prominent tv sources and crossreferences them with the trends from google news, then produces the equivalent of a 30-minute newscast for users to watch, either in full or from one segment to another. in the future, more of the news near you could come from people who do not report the news for a living. as the protests in iran continue to demonstrate, citizens are able to provide much of the spot video from breaking news, even though they may lack the objectivity of professionals. the new iphone includes a video recording capability with a \"send to youtube\" button, suddenly making it simple and fast to upload clips. rachel sterne, the founder and chief executive of the citizen journalism site groundreport, said the feature \"trains laymen to be reporters.\" and youtube says it is developing tools to automatically spotlight those citizen videos as they come in.",

        "title": "strauss-kahn case forces french-americans to examine loyalties.",
        "abstract": "anne cottavoz is of two minds about the dominique strauss-kahn affair, her american mind and her french mind, though she concedes that after living in the united states for 27 years, there may be some blurring of the two. ms. cottavoz, a frenchwoman who owns a health food store on the upper west side, said mr. strauss-kahn's arrest exposed a \"slippery slope\" in france between what she called \"chauvinist behavior\" and something more aggressive, like the sexual assault of a hotel housekeeper that mr. strauss-kahn, the former managing director of the international monetary fund, has been accused of. in new york, she has felt respected as a woman in a way she might not have been in france, where, she said, \"frenchmen get away with too many sexual advances.\" \"we know in france that the general culture makes it comfortable for men to take liberties with women, and in america it's not like that,\" ms. cottavoz, 49, said. \"in america, if they take liberties, there will be consequences.\" the strauss-kahn case has gripped the city's french-american community of roughly 70,000 as few other recent events have. it is the talk of restaurant workers, academics, wine importers and the frenchmen in bryant park who daily play the horseshoes-like game of petanque . the episode has forced many native french people to tease out what part of them has evolved into an american and what part has never left france, which coined the word \"chauvinism\" in the patriotic sense. (nicolas chauvin was a soldier fanatically loyal to napoleon.) french-americans, said thomas bishop, director of the center for french civilization and culture at new york university, do not integrate into the american mainstream as easily as other ethnic groups, retaining stronger feelings for their homeland. the devotion extends to their passion for french politics. rather than dismiss mr. strauss-kahn with tabloid descriptions of him as a \"frisky frenchman,\" they may view his fall from power as that of a man with \"a tragic flaw\" who thought he could \"get away with anything,\" mr. bishop said. and ms. cottavoz, who was raised in the gascony region, said her french blood boiled at some of the ways the police and the news media treated mr. strauss-kahn, particularly how he had been paraded in handcuffs before a crush of photographers. americans, she said, may see a \"perp walk\" as a deterrent, but in france it is illegal and considered an unfair humiliation for someone who has not been convicted. mr. strauss-kahn's defense team has suggested that he and his accuser had a consensual sexual encounter. still, french-americans believe the case has \"tarnished our image,\" said marie-monique steckel, president of the french institute alliance francaise, which promotes french culture and language. when she heard news of mr. strauss-kahn's arrest, she said, she found herself \"extremely emotional,\" adding, \"my frenchness came to the fore with more force than i would have thought.\" and although some french-americans may think americans react too prudishly to the sex scandals of their leaders, ms. steckel said, \"there is a difference between a womanizer and rape.\" \"a womanizer is more acceptable in france,\" she said. \"it's kind of considered good health and vigor, which is different from americans, who are more puritanical. but violence against women is very different.\" seeing conspiracy is another matter that divides americans and french and that raises issues of identity for french-americans. ms. steckel, who said she had lived in the united states for 40 years and decided to become a citizen only after president obama's election, a testimony to what she characterized as this country's openness, said many french-americans found it difficult to talk to friends in france who suspect the arrest was a plot by mr. strauss-kahn's political opponents. mr. strauss-kahn was widely expected to be the socialist candidate for president. french people who have lived in new york for a long time, she said, have moved beyond seeing the world in such a conspiratorial fashion. \"the french adore the idea of plots,\" she said. \"they see plots everywhere. french-americans become more factual.\" nevertheless, some french-americans evidently still see such schemes. michael touchard, 36, manager of tout va bien, a hell's kitchen bistro, said it was hard to believe that \"a man with as much power and so much to gain would try something like this.\" mr. touchard, who came to new york as a child from brittany with his restaurateur parents, does not consider it out of the question that mr. strauss-kahn was framed by opponents aware of his history with women. mr. strauss-kahn was rebuked by the i.m.f. in 2008 for an affair with a married hungarian subordinate. \"if you want to take down your enemy, you have to know his weakness,\" mr. touchard said. there is no single french neighborhood here in the way that astoria is known to be heavily greek, but many french-americans are scattered on the upper east side close to the lycee francais de new york and in suburbs like montclair, n.j., and larchmont, n.y., home to the lower division of the french-american school of new york. the 2005-9 american community survey estimated that new york city had 15,164 people born in france and a total of 70,600 who claimed french ancestry. in the new york, new jersey, connecticut and pennsylvania metropolitan area, it found a total of 20,385 french-born residents and 160,439 of french ancestry. many of them work for french restaurants, french banks and enterprises specializing in perfume, high fashion and luxury goods. they often prefer french newspapers, where the idea that mr. strauss-kahn was the victim of a setup has been frequently discussed. still, mr. bishop of n.y.u. said, french-americans are aware that in france, similar charges embroiling a powerful politician might have been \"swept under the rug\" by a justice system he said was more susceptible to political intrigue. the more scrupulous american justice system is something the french here grow to appreciate, he said. \"the system doesn't always work perfectly,\" mr. bishop said, \"but people cannot just walk away from something.\"",

        "title": "cuomo plans one-year salary freeze for state workers.",
        "abstract": "albany gov. andrew m. cuomo will seek a one-year salary freeze for state workers as part of an emergency financial plan he will lay out in his state of the state address on wednesday, senior administration officials said. the move will signal the opening of what is expected to be a grueling fight between the new governor and the public-sector unions that have traditionally dominated the state's political establishment. it will also come days after the new year's eve layoffs of more than 900 state workers, an event that union representatives marked with a candlelight vigil on the steps of the capitol and outside government offices in five other cities. \"the governor said during his campaign that the difficult financial times call for shared sacrifice,\" said a senior administration official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the governor's address. \"a salary freeze is obviously a difficult thing for many government workers, but it's necessary if the state is going to live within its means.\" while the immediate budget savings from the freeze would be relatively modest between $200 million and $400 million against a projected deficit in excess of $9 billion achieving it would be politically meaningful. and because such a step would not require legislative approval, mr. cuomo could achieve it while bypassing the assembly speaker, sheldon silver , and the democratic-controlled state assembly, labor's most powerful allies in albany. of course, a freeze which mr. cuomo promised he would seek during his campaign would be subject to negotiation with the unions. but labor contracts for the vast majority of the state's 190,000 employees expire on march 31, giving mr. cuomo an opening to seek changes at a time of public unease toward government workers' benefits. salaries, health care and pension benefits for state workers represent one of the largest and fastest-growing areas of spending, accounting for about one-fifth of all state dollars. on sunday, a spokesman for the civil service employees association, the largest union of state workers, said that the association was open to discussions with mr. cuomo, but was uncomfortable with unilateral demands. \"there's a significant difference between negotiating in good faith, and issuing some kind of edict that may or may not be legal,\" said stephen madarasz, the association spokesman. \"it's really all based on what action follows.\" public-sector unions around the nation face growing political pressures not only from republicans but also from their traditional allies among democrats, as governors grapple with recession, declining tax revenues and pension funds perilously close to bankruptcy. in november, following the republican takeover of the house, president obama ordered a two-year salary freeze for civilian federal workers, subject to congressional approval. on wednesday, mr. cuomo is also expected to call for a constitutional cap on state spending that would limit growth to the rate of inflation and for a budget that does not raise corporate, personal income or sales taxes, echoing proposals he made on the campaign trail. he will also repeat his call for a cap on the growth of local property taxes. even if he succeeds in winning a freeze, experts said, mr. cuomo will ultimately need to tackle more difficult public employee benefits, including a substantial restructuring of the state's pension system, which faces serious shortfalls in the coming years. \"the past couple of budgets have really been holdover, stopgap plans,\" said elizabeth lynam, vice president of the citizens budget commission , an advocacy group that favors more limited spending. a one-year salary freeze, she added, would be \"a beginning, and it's a shot across the bow at organized labor, which has to date been uncompromising.\" \"hopefully it will lead to broad-based changes in the way state employees are compensated,\" she said. mr. cuomo has made clear that breaking the stranglehold that entrenched interests, including unions, have on political leaders in albany is a major priority. but mr. cuomo, who has longstanding ties to labor and was endorsed by the public employees federation last year, is hoping that unions will join him in the effort to fix the state's budget problems. in recent months, he invited public-sector unions to become his partners, even sending their leaders copies of \"the man who saved new york,\" a biography of former gov. hugh l. carey , which recounts how mr. carey, a democrat, teamed up with labor leaders in similar fashion in the 1970s. at the same time, mr. cuomo has signaled that he is ready to fight, and has vowed to avoid the fate of his predecessors, who have endured millions of dollars in withering television advertisements from public-sector unions seeking to forestall cuts to state spending. after his landslide victory in november, he kept a substantial campaign war chest on reserve to run his own ads to counter any union-backed television campaigns and is now deploying outside advisers to organize business interests into what he hopes will become a counterweight to labor: a new group known as the committee to save new york. mr. cuomo on sunday attended mass with his girlfriend, sandra lee, and his three daughters at the cathedral of the immaculate conception, down the street from the executive mansion. shortly after that, he returned to work at the capitol, where aides were huddled to help draft wednesday's speech and attend to other issues. \"we're going to be getting back to work,\" he told reporters after the service. he also issued an executive order that will require top administration officials to undergo ethics training within the first three months of this year and to be recertified every two years afterward.",

        "title": "wta takes on eastern european flavor.",
        "abstract": "montreal in the 1970s, the early days of the women's tennis tour, the calendar was dominated by tournaments in the united states, and the draws were filled mostly with americans. at the end of 1980, the world rankings had 31 americans in the top 50. australia was next, with four. combined, all of eastern europe had six players in the top 50 in 1980. there were still only six in 1990. in 2000, about a decade after the fall of the soviet union, there were nine. today, there are 26. the wta is one of the most far-reaching tours, and its success has stemmed from aggressive expansion across borders. but the one thing it cannot control from its florida base is where the players come from where the product originates. it can only decide how to redistribute the product around the world. as the geographic center of talent migrates farther eastward, the question facing the wta is: does it matter if the bulk of the players on tour come from a different part of the world than the bulk of the people supporting it? \"like all businesses, in managing your product, the maturation of your product, you need to be adaptive and go to markets where there is growth,\" stacey allaster , the wta chairwoman and chief executive, said. the tour has focused its expansion efforts the past decade largely on asia and the middle east. regarding russia and eastern europe specifically, allaster added, \"we are just beginning to tap it, without question.\" the challenges and opportunities facing the women's tour are not as striking on the men's tour, which remains, for now, centered on western europe. in the men's top 50 on aug. 23, eight players were from spain, six from france, four from the united states. russia (two) and eastern europe combined for 14. on the women's tour, americans now have three spots in the top 50 a 90 percent drop from 30 years ago. russia has nine 10 if you include yaroslava shvedova , who was born and raised and still lives in moscow but got away from the clog of competition by playing for kazakhstan. \"when i moved to kazakhstan, i was their no. 1 player,\" she said. the russians may want her back; shvedova cracked the world top 30 this summer. underlying issues are as obvious as the draw sheets and the perplexed conversations of fans who struggle to recognize and keep straight top-25 players like agnieszka radwanska (poland), victoria azarenka (belarus) and anastasia pavlyuchenkova (russia) never mind pronounce their names. \"especially with our long names, it can be hard to put the face with the name,\" said vera zvonareva of russia, a finalist at this year's wimbledon. one second-round match at the rogers cup in montreal featured the russians dinara safina and nadia petrova. they have long histories of top-five rankings and deep major-tournament runs. yet confused fans sometimes ask one to sign a photograph of the other. in some ways, the proliferation of russian and eastern european players on the tour is similar to the influx of south korean women on the women's golf tour. in 2008, the l.p.g.a., its operations far more tethered to the united states than the wta's, had plans to require players to be conversant in english or face suspension, a controversial and short-lived effort to broaden appeal to fans and sponsors. most tennis players eagerly speak english. many, following the leads of russian players like anna kournikova and maria sharapova, see tennis as a path to broader fortune . some live in the united states. still, in the wta's perfect world, the rankings would have an even distribution of players from as many countries as possible. the french open final between francesca schiavone of italy and samantha stosur of australia was a marketing dream women from different continents who became instant sensations in their home countries. \"it would be great to have a national star in every market,\" allaster said. balanced harmony was nearly achieved with the aug. 23 rankings. the top 10 players represented nine countries. but down deeper, the number of countries represented across the top 50 has not changed drastically. in 1990, the top 50 had 20 countries. in 2000, it was 24. today, it is 26. the wta has broadened its breadth of major sponsors, but none are based where a majority of players come from. individual players, too, find few sponsors back home. shvedova, for example, said she had a clothing deal with lacoste and a sunglasses deal with oakley but nothing from russia or kazakhstan. the tour's title sponsor is sony ericsson, a mobile communications company, and other sponsors include american companies like usana health sciences and bed bath & beyond, as well as dubai duty free and peak, a chinese apparel maker. oriflame is a western european cosmetics company, but it will focus much of its sponsorship efforts in the baltic region, allaster said. likewise, the schedule is far more international than it once was, now divided almost evenly among north america, europe, and asia and australia. but top-level expansion has taken place mostly where there are few top-level players, at least for now. the wta has seven upper-tier tournaments in the united states, not including the united states open . it has one in russia, in moscow in october. another premier tournament is held in warsaw in may. cold climate and relatively few suitable facilities hamper expansion into russia and eastern europe, although the wta has moved quickly into new markets at the second tier, placing tournaments in cities like budapest; portoroz, slovenia; and tashkent, uzbekistan. \"there is no lack of interest from promoters who want to stage a women's event, particularly in asia and the pacific and in eastern european countries,\" allaster said. the tour has an opening for a premier event at the start of the year, before sydney and the australian open. it may go to australia, india, the middle east or even south africa. the calendar flows toward the grand slam events. tournaments before the french open are played in warm weather on clay. they are played on grass before wimbledon, and in the heat on hardcourts leading to the united states open in new york. that is where american fans will find the world's best players, even if they do not quite recognize the faces and the names. thirty years ago, a majority of the players were american. this year, most matches will feature players with names many fans struggle to pronounce from countries many probably could not find on a map. \"they ask you as you sign an autograph, 'what is your name?' \" the russian elena vesnina good-naturedly said of americans. \" 'can you write your name down?' \"",

        "title": "health care law spurs merger talks for insurers.",
        "abstract": "president obama signed the affordable care act more than five years ago. at the time, members of the health care industry hospitals, doctors and insurers were anxious about what it would do to the business. everyone had an opinion, but nobody knew for sure. we're now beginning to see the answer: consolidation on a huge scale. just in the last couple of weeks, the nation's five largest health insurers began a round robin of merger talks some still semiprivate, others now out in the open that could whittle their number to three. anthem made a bid for cigna; aetna approached humana; and the unitedhealth group made overtures to aetna. those potential deals come on the heels of a spate of hospital mergers over the last couple of years and speculation about another round of such deals. all of this deal-making is largely the result of the affordable care act, which in effect constrains the amount of profit hospitals and insurers can generate, leading both to seek additional scale in hopes of generating higher margins by squeezing additional savings out of a broader customer base. to some degree, consolidation among hospitals and insurers was part of the design of the law, which sought to provide health care for the uninsured and help push down health care costs. that led health care companies to find efficiencies. that, in turn, meant deals. in 2011, the aetna chief executive, mark t. bertolini, responded matter-of-factly to an analyst's question about possible mergers: \"i expect and we expect that consolidation will continue going forward here as health reform shakes out winners and losers in the process.\" the question, of course, remains whether the savings that might come from consolidation will trickle down to the consumer or will simply wind up in the pocket of shareholders. the prevailing view is not promising. \"seldom does consolidation result in reduced costs for consumers. bigger insurance companies mean increased leverage and unfair power over negotiating rates with hospitals and physicians,\" the american academy of family physicians wrote in a letter earlier this month to the federal trade commission, urging that it block the latest series of deals. \"more often than not, consolidation increases costs and reduces options for consumers, and we believe this would hold true in the health insurance market.\" perhaps more striking, cigna, in its rejection of anthem's $47 billion takeover bid, cited the risk of antitrust suits that have ensnared anthem as the largest member of the blue cross blue shield association. that association has been accused of cartel-like practices, deliberately preventing competition so as to increase prices for hospitals and patients. cigna's rejection of anthem and its highlighting of antitrust risks, just to be clear, was not aimed at ending merger talks. oddly enough, people involved in the negotiations suggested it was simply a tactic to press anthem to pay more, in part to compensate cigna shareholders for the possibility that a deal could be blocked. of course, regulators will most likely look hard at any large deals among insurers. but it would be ironic if the administration, after helping to get the law passed with the support of the insurance industry, then prevented insurers from merging. so far, regulators have looked favorably at big hospital mergers, persuaded by the efficiencies argument. \"the fear that mergers curtail competition, leading to higher prices for medical care, reflects an old way of thinking that doesn't account for the introduction of population-health management,\" dr. kenneth l. davis, the chief executive of mount sinai health system, wrote persuasively in the wall street journal. \"this line of thought ignores the fact that health care delivery has become more efficient. health care has changed, too: medical advances mean that people recover from serious illness and injury faster and live longer, healthier lives.\" nonetheless, regulators would have good reason to consider ways to try to maintain competition among the largest insurers. in one of the few studies conducted on the impact of consolidation in the insurance industry on premiums, academics looked at the effect of the 2007 merger of the unitedhealth group and sierra health services on consumers in nevada. the results were striking. \"if there were any benefits to consumers realized from the merger, we could not observe them, and we can infer that they did not come in the form of lower premiums,\" the authors wrote in the journal health management, policy and innovation. \"on the contrary, the evidence suggests that large health insurer mergers are anticompetitive and cause injury to consumers through an increase in the price of health insurance services.\" the authors said that they found \"premiums in nevada markets increased by 13.7 percent after the merger relative to the control group.\" they added, \"our findings suggest that the merging parties exploited the market power gained from the merger.\" based on the high-flying stock prices of the big health insurers right now, investors must be convinced that bigger profits are in the offing. the chief executives are also expecting big paydays. virtually every one of them has planned large golden parachutes in anticipation that their companies could be taken over. according to data compiled by bloomberg, mr. bertolini of aetna stands to make $131.3 million in a takeover if he were pushed out; david cordani of cigna would make $58.7 million; and bruce d. broussard of humana would receive $26.1 million. mr. bertolini was probably right about winners and losers. the big health insurers could win. their shareholders could win. their executives could win. on the other side, however, may very well be the consumers.",

        "abstract": "having dodged political calamity with a victory on tuesday night in his home state of michigan , mitt romney quickly shifted his attention to ohio on wednesday morning as his chief rival vowed an aggressive, nationwide fight for the republican nomination in the weeks ahead. at a rally in toledo, mr. romney hammered president obama 's leadership and argued that the republican party must nominate someone with the experience and the economic know-how to turn around a nation at risk of losing its way. \"this president has made some promises that he couldn't keep,\" mr. romney said. \"he's out of ideas, he's out of excuses, and in 2012 we are going to make sure he's out of office.\" speaking at american posts, a small, family-owned factory that makes fence posts, mr. romney largely ignored his chief rival, rick santorum , as he argued that mr. obama has stood in the way of economic recovery during the past three years. mr. romney pledged across-the-board tax cuts, tougher trade policy and broad spending cuts. \"on day 1, i will declare china a currency manipulator, allowing me to put tariffs on products where they are stealing american jobs unfairly,\" mr. romney said. \"i'm going to insist that china plays by the same rules.\" mr. romney's twin victories over mr. santorum in arizona and michigan have quieted for now what had been growing questions about his command of the republican field and his ability to appeal to the conservative base of his party. the victories earned him about three-quarters of the delegates at play tuesday night, extending his numerical lead over his opponents. mr. romney won all 29 of arizona's delegates and about half of those in michigan, where the final allocation was still being worked out. but the difficulty winning what was expected to be an easy contest in michigan underscored how the republican contest has become a slow, state-by-state slog. in addition to ohio, nine other states will cast ballots in the republican primaries and caucuses on super tuesday next week. after that, primaries and caucuses continue through june. mr. santorum spent the day campaigning in tennessee , which is among the states holding primaries next week. mr. santorum's failure to capitalize on his momentum threatened to undermine his argument that mr. romney will not be an ineffective nominee against mr. obama in the fall. but in radio interviews on wednesday morning, mr. santorum said he felt \"very good\" about what his campaign accomplished and promised a vigorous campaign in the super tuesday states. \"we feel very, very good in the campaign that we waged,\" mr. santorum said. \"we're doing very good. we sustained ourselves. we think we are going to have a very, very good super tuesday.\" mr. santorum complained that mr. romney and his allies outspent him \"6 or 12 to one\" in the michigan contest. but he predicted a more fair fight in the super tuesday states thanks to a surge in recent contributions to his campaign in february. \"i'd be stunned if we didn't out-raise romney this month,\" mr. santorum said, estimating that his campaign raised as much as $9 million in the last 28 days. that would be a huge boost in financial support for a campaign that just weeks ago was running on fumes. mr. santorum also pointed out that mr. romney made an appeal for donations during his victory speech in michigan on tuesday night, an indication, mr. santorum said, that money might be a concern for mr. romney's campaign. \"he is increasingly relying and will be relying, on his big, megasuper donors,\" mr. santorum said, noting that two-third of his own donors have contributed less than $100 each, which means they can be tapped further without hitting contribution limits. \"that to me is a potential advantage for us going forward.\" during his swing on wednesday through tennessee, mr. santorum was scheduled to appear at events in powell and nashville . tennessee is one of three states that mr. santorum said he expected to do well in on tuesday. the other two, he said, are ohio and oklahoma . but much of the focus will be on ohio, a must-win state for republicans in the general election and an important test for mr. romney and mr. santorum as they try to prove that they can expand their bases of support. in their victory speeches tuesday night, neither mr. romney nor mr. santorum mentioned each other, choosing instead to focus their rhetoric on the economy and mr. obama even as the republican contest moves to ohio. \"we need a recovery from this recovery,\" mr. romney said, a message squarely aimed at the struggling middle class. mr. santorum echoed that theme, saying that \"it's getting harder for people to make ends meet because we have a government that is crushing us every single day.\" mr. romney is campaigning on thursday in north dakota , a super tuesday state, and washington state , which will caucus on friday, but will return to ohio on friday for events there. mr. romney and mr. santorum are also scheduled to tape appearances on mike huckabee 's weekend program on fox news. also on mr. huckabee's program will be newt gingrich , who placed a distant fourth in arizona and michigan on tuesday night after skipping both contests to focus on several southern states that will vote next tuesday. ron paul , who came in third in both states tuesday night, spent the evening in virginia , where he will be the only challenger to mr. romney on tuesday. neither mr. gingrich, nor mr. santorum, qualified for the ballot in virginia.",

        "abstract": "los angeles federal agents conducted a series of raids on wednesday morning across this city's fashion district, sweeping more than 70 locations, arresting nine people, and seizing at least $65 million in cash and assets from organizations with ties to mexican cartels, law enforcement officials said. justice department officials said that the sum was only a piece of the money cartels were laundering through los angeles businesses, many of them clothing wholesalers. \"los angeles has become the epicenter of narco-dollar money laundering, with couriers regularly bringing duffel bags and suitcases full of cash to many of these businesses,\" said robert e. dugdale, the assistant united states attorney in charge of federal criminal prosecutions here. mr. dugdale said that the cartels had long laundered money through businesses on both sides of the border, but that the practice had expanded since mexico restricted deposits of american dollars in 2010, forcing the cartels to convert dollars into pesos. instead of trucking cash across the border in the trunks of cars, he said, the cartels have come to rely on paying american companies with business partners in mexico to help move the money in ways that appear legitimate. the drug money can offer a windfall for businesses in the garment district here. at one business, $35 million that the authorities said was drug money had been neatly stashed in bank boxes, with $1 million in each one. at a home in the affluent bel air neighborhood with ties to a business in the fashion district, officials reported finding $10 million stuffed into duffel bags. in one laundering scheme, the authorities said, the sinaloa cartel used a fashion district business to move ransom money to mexico from the united states. after 100 kilograms, or about 220 pounds, of cocaine was seized in the united states, the cartel kidnapped the man who had been responsible for distributing the cocaine and held him hostage in mexico, where he was tortured beaten, electrocuted, waterboarded and shot until his family north of the border paid a $140,000 ransom. that ransom money was taken to a company called q.t. fashion here. then it was distributed in smaller amounts to 17 other businesses throughout the fashion district, which moved it to business partners in mexico and ultimately to the cartel. kamala d. harris, the attorney general of california, said the state had long served as a gateway for mexican cartels to gain access to the rest of the country. she said the money seized on wednesday was a \"historic take\" from the cartels and would put a \"huge hole\" in their operations.",

        "abstract": "johannesburg richard goldstone, the south african judge who had said threatened protests at his grandson's bar mitzvah would keep him from attending , has reached an agreement with jewish groups here that will allow him to go to the ceremony after all. \"i am delighted that i will be able to attend the bar mitzvah,\" the judge said in an e-mail message on saturday. a day earlier, the south african jewish board of deputies , which represents most of the country's synagogues, issued a statement that outlined something like a quid pro quo: a promise of no protests on the bar mitzvah boy's big day, in exchange for a meeting between the judge and leaders of the south african zionist federation and other jewish organizations. judge goldstone, a former member of this country's highest court, led a united nations investigation into israel's invasion of gaza that concluded that israel and hamas had taken actions amounting to war crimes. though the findings rebuked both sides, the sharper criticism was aimed at israel. the israeli government disputed the conclusions, and many jewish groups argued that the report was not only wrongheaded but that it was also part of vicious international efforts to defame israel and deny its legitimacy. in south africa , as elsewhere, jewish opinion was divided. some lauded mr. goldstone as a man of principle while others called him a traitor to his people. at least one organization, identified by the judge as the south african zionist federation, warned that mr. goldstone's attendance at the bar mitzvah next month would be met with protests. but the announcement by the board of deputies on friday said there had been \"consultation with all parties involved\" and now the bar mitzvah would \"be returned to the privacy and dignity it deserves.\" however joyous the young man's ceremony at a suburban johannesburg synagogue may be, the promised meeting is likely to be rancorous. the zionist federation has contended that the goldstone report was \"unequivocally hostile to israel while being little more than fallacious propaganda.\" last week, warren goldstein, the chief rabbi of south africa and a persistent critic of the report, wrote in the newspaper business day that the judge should be allowed to attend the bar mitzvah because every synagogue \"should welcome in a tolerant and nonjudgmental way all who seek to enter and join in our service and pray to god.\" but rabbi goldstein also renewed his criticism of the judge, saying his report \"has unfairly done enormous damage to the reputation and safety of the state of israel and her citizens.\" in a letter to the editor published the next day, judge goldstone wrote that he was \"dismayed that the chief rabbi would so brazenly politicize the occasion of my 13-year-old grandson's bar mitzvah to engage in further personal attacks on me.\" he added that rabbi goldstein's \"rhetoric\" about tolerance \"simply does not coincide with how my family and i have been treated.\"",

        "abstract": "after 44 years of debating sexuality issues, the united methodist church voted by a narrow margin on wednesday to allow bishops to appoint a commission to re-evaluate rules on gay, lesbian and transgender clergy and marriage. the 428-to-405 vote by the delegates to the church's quadrennial conference in portland, ore., was seen by many as a last-ditch effort to save the church from schism. it was celebrated by l.g.b.t. methodists and their supporters as a way to buy time and avoid church discipline against more than 100 clergy and clergy candidates who came out as gay in advance of the conference. but it disappointed many conservatives who were exasperated that their church is still arguing over what they see as clear church teachings that prohibit openly gay and transgender clergy, and same-sex marriage. the church's book of discipline, its governing document, says that the \"practice of homosexuality\" is \"incompatible with christian teaching.\" during the debate on the convention floor, marquice hobbs, a young delegate from texas, urged church members to \"lay aside all the political jargon, take a stand,\" and \"do not be afraid to break.\" but george howard, the delegate from ohio who proposed the measure, responded, \"i am not afraid.\" he said, \"i believe that our leaders are ready, willing and able to lead this church to discover a new way forward for us all.\" the united methodist church is the third-largest religious body in the united states, after the roman catholic church and the southern baptist convention, with about seven million members, including hillary clinton and george w. bush. it has 12 million worldwide. its membership ranges from theological liberals to conservative evangelicals. while many mainline protestant churches, like the presbyterian church usa and the evangelical lutheran church in america, have moved to permit gay clergy and same-sex marriages, the methodist church has remained opposed. that is mainly because it includes branches in africa and asia that are growing rapidly and are theologically conservative while the american branch has had declines. the church's liberals had hoped that growing acceptance of gay people and gay marriage in the united states would provide momentum. but faced with likely rejection, they embraced a proposal to ask the church's council of bishops to find a way forward. the council is made up of all active and retired bishops from the church's 46 areas in the united states and 20 outside. the bishops' council proposed that the conference defer all votes on sexuality measures; more than 100 such measures were sent to the 10-day meeting. the bishops proposed that they appoint a representative commission to undertake a \"complete examination and possible revision of every paragraph in our book of discipline regarding human sexuality.\" the bishops' statement said that they heard from many members that the rules had language that was \"contradictory, unnecessarily hurtful and inadequate\" for a diverse and global church.",

        "abstract": "london a potential strike by workers that the logistics company dhl provides to jaguar land rover's factories could threaten to derail the automaker's fast growth. unite, a big british trade union, said this week that dhl workers in halewood, where jaguar land rover's best-selling range rover evoque is made, had authorized a strike by an 86 percent vote. dhl staff at the company's two other plants at solihull and castle bromwich in the midlands had previously voted for action by around 70 percent, according to ciaran naidoo, a spokesman for the union. mr. naidoo said that a strike, if it occurred, was probably weeks away. he said the union workers, who seek higher pay, were \"open for negotiation.\" the workers, who number about 2,000, are crucial to the plants' efficient functioning. among other tasks, they whisk components from logistics centers at the factories to the assembly lines in small electric carts. jaguar land rover has been key to the revival of the british auto industry in recent years. since being rescued through a $2.3 billion purchase from ford motor by tata motors of india in 2008, jaguar land rover has experienced a sharp turnaround with the output of vehicles doubling since 2009, to almost 360,000 last year. for the fiscal year that ended in march, the unit earned 1.7 billion, or $2.5 billion, on sales of 15.8 billion. more than 80 percent of the vehicles are exported. china and the united states are the largest markets. britain is one of the few countries in economically stagnant europe where car production has been growing. the potential labor disruption also highlights tensions over outside companies providing staff at factories, an increasingly common practice in britain and elsewhere in europe. the workers that unite has balloted so far are full-time employees of dhl supply chain, a division of dhl. the union also plans to ballot temporary workers supplied by dhl through two agencies. \"we are extremely disappointed that unite has rejected our very generous offer and voted in favor of industrial action,\" dhl said in a statement. dhl said it had offered its workers a 4.5 percent pay increase for 2013, along with a one-time 1.7 percent cash payment. the company said that this would put its drivers who deliver the parts to the jaguar factories in the trucking industry's upper quartile and the workers who distribute the parts within those plants in the top 10 percent for the british logistics industry. dhl says unite is asking for a 20.6 percent increase for drivers and 12.8 percent for other workers. mr. naidoo of unite said what was at issue was \"pay terms and work conditions\" but declined to go into details. the union contends its workers are not treated as well as the 14,500 jaguar land rover manufacturing employees. jaguar land rover said it would \"put several measures into place to minimize the impact of any potential industrial action upon our production schedule and ultimately our customers.\"",

        "abstract": "fort worth ethan couch, the teenager who used an \"affluenza\" defense in a drunken-driving crash that killed four people and then violated probation by traveling to mexico with his mother, was sentenced on wednesday to nearly two years in jail. mr. couch, who turned 19 on monday, had previously avoided a harsher punishment because he was sentenced in juvenile court, where the emphasis is on rehabilitation. but after his foray to mexico last year, prosecutors moved the case to adult court. on wednesday, a district court judge, wayne f. salvant, ruled that mr. couch must spend 720 days in tarrant county jail 180 days for each count of intoxication manslaughter. the judge said the court would reconvene in two weeks to consider modifying the terms after each side submitted additional written arguments. \"nothing i do is in stone, so i might reconsider,\" judge salvant said. mr. couch showed no emotion as the sentence was read. he will remain in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day for his protection, dee anderson, tarrant county's sheriff told reporters after the hearing. family members of those who were killed or injured in the accident and who were in the courtroom declined to comment. ethan's father, fred couch, who was in court, also declined to comment. judge salvant has imposed a gag order, preventing prosecutors and defense lawyers from discussing the case outside the courtroom. sheriff anderson said mr. couch had created \"zero issues\" since he was placed in tarrant county jail in january. \"i do believe ethan couch is not the same person he was when he came to jail,\" he said. \"the time he's spent, it's a rude awakening for anyone.\" if the case had remained in juvenile court, mr. couch's probation would have ended on his 19th birthday. the case dates from june 15, 2013, when mr. couch, who was 16 at the time, and a group of friends stole beer from a store, had a party at his parents' house and then went for a drive. mr. couch, who was behind the wheel, hit four people on the side of a road outside burleson, a suburb of fort worth, killing them. a passenger in mr. couch's vehicle was paralyzed and suffered brain damage. hours after his arrest, mr. couch had a blood alcohol level of 0.24, three times the legal limit for drivers in texas. mr. couch's case received widespread attention after a defense witness argued that mr. couch suffered from \"affluenza,\" a term used to describe psychological problems that can afflict children of privilege. a juvenile court judge, jean boyd, subsequently declined to give him the punishment sought by tarrant county prosecutors 20 years in prison and ordered him to be placed in a long-term treatment facility while on 10-year probation. the decision angered the families of those mr. couch killed and injured. others questioned whether a teenager with a less affluent background would have received similar leniency. in december, prosecutors began investigating whether mr. couch had violated his probation after a video posted online appeared to show him at a party where alcohol was being consumed. then mr. couch vanished. he later turned up with his mother, tonya couch, in puerto vallarta, mexico, where they were arrested. ms. couch has been charged with hindering apprehension. because he had fled, mr. couch was placed in juvenile detention after being brought back to texas. but prosecutors did not pursue a specific penalty in juvenile court for a probation violation because mr. couch would have aged out of the system once he turned 19. instead, mr. couch's case was moved to adult court, which led to wednesday's hearing. once he serves his jail sentence, mr. couch will have probation conditions similar to those imposed on him when he was a juvenile, judge salvant said on wednesday. under the conditions, he will be prohibited from leaving the fort worth area without approval from probation or court officials. mr. couch will not be allowed to drive or to consume alcohol and must look for a job. judge salvant said that mr. couch would also be required to perform community service, but that he had not yet determined how many hours the teenager should perform.",

        "title": "concern grows over top military officers' ethics.",
        "abstract": "washington along with a steady diet of books on leadership and management, the reading list at military \"charm schools\" that groom officers for ascending to general or admiral includes an essay, \"the bathsheba syndrome: the ethical failure of successful leaders,\" that recalls the moral failure of the old testament's king david, who ordered a soldier on a mission of certain death solely for the chance to take his wife, bathsheba. the not-so-subtle message: be careful out there, and act better. despite the warnings, a worrisomely large number of senior officers have been investigated and even fired for poor judgment, malfeasance and sexual improprieties or sexual violence and that is just in the last year. gen. william ward of the army, known as kip, the first officer to open the new africa command, came under scrutiny for allegations of misusing tens of thousands of government dollars for travel and lodging. brig. gen. jeffrey a. sinclair, a former deputy commander of the 82nd airborne division in afghanistan, is confronting the military equivalent of a grand jury to decide whether he should stand trial for adultery, sexual misconduct and forcible sodomy, stemming from relationships with five women. james h. johnson iii, a former commander of the 173rd airborne brigade, was expelled from the army, fined and reduced in rank to lieutenant colonel from colonel after being convicted of bigamy and fraud stemming from an improper relationship with an iraqi woman and business dealings with her family. the air force is struggling to recover from a scandal at its basic training center at lackland air force base, texas, where six male instructors were charged with crimes including rape and adultery after female recruits told of sexual harassment and sexual assault. in the navy, rear adm. charles m. gaouette was relieved of command of the stennis aircraft carrier strike group remarkably while the task force was deployed in the middle east. officials said that the move was ordered after \"inappropriate leadership judgment.\" no other details were given. while there is no evidence that david h. petraeus had an extramarital affair while serving as one of the nation's most celebrated generals, his resignation last week as director of the central intelligence agency a job president obama said he could take only if he left the army was a sobering reminder of the kind of inappropriate behavior that has cast a shadow over the military's highest ranks. those concerns were only heightened on tuesday when it was revealed that gen. john r. allen, the top american and nato commander in afghanistan, is under investigation for what a senior defense official said was \"inappropriate communication\" with jill kelley, the woman in tampa, fla., who was seen as a rival for mr. petraeus's attentions by paula broadwell, who had an extramarital affair with mr. petraeus. the episodes have prompted concern that something may be broken, or at least fractured, across the military's culture of leadership. some wonder whether its top officers have forgotten the lessons of bathsheba: the crown of command should not be worn with arrogance, and while rank has its privileges, remember that infallibility and entitlement are not among them. david s. maxwell , a retired army colonel now serving as associate director for security studies at walsh school of foreign service at georgetown university, said that the instances of failed or flawed leadership \"are tragic and serious,\" but that he doubts there are more today, on a relative scale, than in the past. mr. maxwell noted that abraham lincoln and franklin d. roosevelt, both wartime presidents, fired many more generals than presidents george w. bush or obama. \"these general and flag officers are humans,\" he said. \"faced with stress, and a very complex combat environment, people make mistakes. these incidents do not represent the vast majority of our senior leaders.\" like the troops, wartime commanders are separated from family for long periods, and the weight of responsibility in a business where the metric of failure is a body bag, not the bottom line bears heavily. still, with drivers and staff, private quarters and guaranteed hot meals, the lifestyle of the top echelon of commanders on the battlefield offers a significant buffer from the hourly rigors of frontline combat endured by the troops. so explanations differ for the lapses. paul v. kane, a marine corps reserve gunnery sergeant who is an iraq veteran and former fellow of harvard university's international security program, believes the military is not the only institution facing a problem. \"the country is suffering a crisis of leadership in politics, in business and in the church, as well as in the military,\" he said. \"we have lots of leaders, but we have a national deficit in true leadership.\" he acknowledged that the post-9/11 stress on the military, from enlisted personnel to commanders, has fractured the very souls of people in uniform. \"when you pull people out of family life, repeatedly, over the course of a decade, you are going to fray their most basic relationships with spouses, with children, with their own personal code,\" mr. kane said. other national security experts warn that a decade of conflict shouldered by an all-volunteer force has separated those in uniform about 1 percent of society from the rest of the citizenry. such a \"military apart\" is not healthy for the nation because the fighting force may begin to believe it operates under rules that are different from those the rest of civilian society follows, and perhaps with a separate set of benefits, as well. \"our military is holding itself to a higher standard than the rest of american society,\" said kori n. schake, an associate professor at west point who has held senior policy positions at the departments of state and defense. \"that is beautiful and noble,\" she added. \"but it's also disconcerting. sometimes military people talk about being a praetorian guard at our national bacchanal. that's actually quite dangerous for them to consider themselves different and better.\" in extreme cases, say some military officers and pentagon officials, the result of this \"military apart\" is that commanders may come to view their sacrifice as earning them the right to disregard rules of conduct. they note that if anything positive emerges from an era of increased scrutiny of misbehavior, it will be an invigorated effort to hold the officer corps to account for the way troops are led in combat, for the way the treasury is spent, for the way military leaders wear the mask of command. and they warn that the problem may get worse before it gets better. while most of the more notable improprieties have been alleged against officers of the ground forces, the navy, which has not been the fulcrum of the wars of the last decade, is also showing strain. a study by the navy times found more than 20 commanding officers were fired this year for inappropriate behavior and misconduct. \"the navy's time in the stress tester is coming,\" said peter d. feaver, a professor of political science at duke university. \"the number of ships is dropping. the number of tours will increase. reliance on the navy instead of the army to back up foreign policy will become greater over the next decade than the last. if the navy is cracking under a past decade of strain, what will it mean for the navy when it is in the hot seat?\"",

        "title": "grandson of china's most-hated landlord challenges communist lore.",
        "abstract": "anren, china to many chinese, liu wencai is the archetype of the despotic landlord from pre-communist days, one who exploited his tenants, tortured those who fell behind on rent in a \"water dungeon\" and forced new mothers to breast-feed him as a longevity therapy. but his grandson liu xiaofei, 70, has spent the past two decades trying to prove that his grandfather was not only a good man, but actually aided the communist forces in sichuan province. \"the ruling party has no integrity, so i have to tell the truth,\" mr. liu said in an interview. he said he was not seeking his grandfather's formal rehabilitation but simply trying to establish that the government fabricated stories to advance its political goals. \"by inciting hatred through propaganda, they turned humans into beasts,\" he said. \"i want to tell the truth so our nation won't repeat these mistakes.\" mr. liu, a retired oil-well construction worker, spends his days at a computer in his apartment in longchang, in southern sichuan, working on a book based on research that includes more than 1,000 interviews. when he travels to the town of anren, where his grandfather's manor was turned into a museum in 1959 to showcase evil deeds he is reported to have committed, mr. liu gives impassioned speeches to visitors, pointing out which exhibits essentially, all of them, he says are fake. image liu wencai, right, standing in front of wencai middle school, which he built in 1942. with him is gao shuyuan, the school's first principal. credit wu hongyuan mr. liu said it was a single sentence his mother uttered in the late 1960s, during the cultural revolution, that sent him on his journey, a one-man battle even family members consider doomed in a tightening political climate. \"the underground communists' command headquarters was right in our manor,\" he said she told him. \"those words were engraved in my heart.\" on a misty morning, mr. liu walked past cafes, bars and design stores lining the streets of anren, now a tourist destination known as the township of museums, for the liu family manors and other cultural sites. a luxury hotel has been built for vacationers and parents visiting their children at the confucius international school , which promises to prepare pupils for top foreign universities and boasts of being housed in a school that liu wencai built in 1942, where tuition fees were waived for poor but talented pupils. many residents seem to remember liu wencai favorably. \"if you ask if people here think liu wencai was good, that goes without saying,\" said dai rongyao, 89, who was selling embroidered handicrafts. liu wencai, born in 1887, amassed huge wealth in the 1920s in the yangtze river port of yibin, dominating lucrative businesses including the opium and weapons trades under the wing of his younger brother, liu wenhui, a nationalist warlord. in 1933, liu wenhui retreated to the tibetan region of kham, after losing a battle to a warlord nephew, and liu wencai returned to his hometown, anren, and sponsored road, water and electricity projects as well as the school. in 1942, liu wenhui, long at odds with the nationalist leader chiang kai-shek, met with zhou enlai and began clandestinely cooperating with his communists. image the life-size sculptures that make up rent collection yard depict liu wencai as a despotic landlord exploiting destitute peasants. credit wu hongyuan in 1946, at the start of the chinese civil war, liu wencai financed a communist guerrilla force of around 50 people while allowing its command headquarters to be set up in his manor, said mr. liu, who said he learned this from a close aide to liu wencai who has since died. (a provincial government history says that underground communists took advantage of liu wencai's conflict with a rival to secure weapons from him.) liu wencai died in october 1949, the same month that mao zedong proclaimed the founding of the people's republic. in december, his brother liu wenhui openly joined forces with the communists, and the nationalists retreated from sichuan to taiwan. the liu family, like many wealthy chinese, considered fleeing to hong kong, fearing what might happen under the new communist government, mr. liu said. but liu wenhui urged them to stay, insisting the family would be treated well as the party's friend. instead, the family's property was seized and its members attacked in a series of political campaigns. in 1958, local officials eager to demonstrate their fervor for maoist class struggle presented liu wencai as the prototype of the exploiting landlord. his coffin was dug up, and his remains were scattered. in 1959, the landlord's residence was turned into a museum, featuring a \"water dungeon,\" an underground space half-filled with water. a woman who claimed to be the dungeon's sole survivor described it as filled with human bones. by the early 1960s, liu wencai was nationally notorious as the \"chief representative of the landlord class for 3,000 years.\" his brother liu wenhui, who in 1959 became forestry minister and escaped persecution under zhou enlai's protection, was powerless to reverse the propaganda campaign, though he was secretly upset. \"what the hell are they talking about?\" was his private comment on one newspaper article about liu wencai, according to his grandson liu shizhao. image liu wenhui, the younger brother of liu wencai and a nationalist warlord in sichuan province who later allied with the communists. credit liu xiaofei in 1965, the sichuan authorities commissioned more than 100 life-size clay sculptures that the museum installed as the rent collection courtyard, which purported to show how liu wencai and his lackeys bullied peasants to extract rents. replicas of the statues were exhibited in beijing later that year, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors. in 1966, just before the onset of the cultural revolution, a documentary about liu wencai was released, and stories of his crimes were subsequently included in textbooks. denunciations of the landlord and the evil he ostensibly personified surged during the cultural revolution. family members came under attack. a cousin of mr. liu who fled to xinjiang was murdered along with his wife and children, as were many other people in china branded as \"landlords.\" the frenzy subsided only in the 1980s, when liberal voices were tolerated to some extent. in 1988, the provincial authorities admitted that the water dungeon was an invention, and it was drained. but these beginnings of a re-evaluation stalled after the 1989 tiananmen crackdown as the party tightened its grip, mr. liu said. in the museum, mr. liu pointed out items he said never belonged to his family. a visitor asked, \"this is your family?\" \"i'm liu wencai's grandson,\" mr. liu said. \"can we take a picture with you?\" the man shouted excitedly, pointing at his friends. mr. liu became the group's tour guide, and the man, a railway official from guizhou who said he had visited the museum on a school tour in the 1970s, was startled when mr. liu said that nearly everything on display was fake. xiao shu, the pen name of chen min, who in 1999 published \"the truth about liu wencai,\" a book that was soon banned, said the party would be reluctant to restore to respectability a villain of its own making. his book was accused of \"negating the legitimacy of the new democratic revolution,\" when the party persecuted landlords and distributed their property to poor peasants, he said. \"this is the basis of the regime's legitimacy, so they don't dare face the truth.\" wu hongyuan, 60, a retired county propaganda official who served as the museum's director in the 1990s, said the process of restoring the truth could not be rushed. \"the museum is too sensitive, and liu wencai is too famous,\" he said. mr. wu said he tried to recast the museum to more accurately present liu wencai's life, but anytime he altered something, he said, former underground communists in anren would protest to the authorities. li weijia, 98, was one of those protesters. \"he never protected party members!\" insisted mr. li, in a hospital ward reserved for senior officials in chengdu. \"that's confusing black and white!'' at the end of his trip to anren, mr. liu visited chen fahong, 86, a former worker in liu wencai's manor. \"we had rice and meat to eat then. he was kind,\" mr. chen said of liu wencai in his modest yard amid onion fields. \"after liberation\" in 1949, he said, \"we had only bran and grass to eat.\" mr. liu said that, looking back, the family regretted having trusted the communists. he recalled a song sung in his family after liu wenhui sided with the communists, envisioning a paradise under the party's rule. \"there is a good place beyond the mountains,\" it goes. \"there, rich and poor are equal.\"",

        "title": "gingrich will be back in the 'crossfire' on cnn.",
        "abstract": "arlington, va. in defeat, the 2012 republican presidential hopefuls have mostly faded from view, in ways that seem true to type. mitt romney is a contented grandfather. rick santorum leads a christian movie company. michele bachmann is retiring from the house, although her pants-on-fire oratory is likely to find a new home. and what of the 2012 contender with a slashing debate style, who prolonged his primary run seemingly to remain in the media spotlight? newt gingrich has also earned his just deserts: he has been named a host of cnn's revived \"crossfire,\" the granddaddy of political debate shows. the appointment will ensure that he remains the most prominent republican from the presidential class of 2012 to retain influence in the national conversation. mr. gingrich gleefully criticized \"the media elite\" as a candidate, but now he is unquestionably a member. \"yes,\" he agreed. \"and i hope to move it to the right.\" eight years after the original \"crossfire\" was canceled, its revival is a bet by cnn that there is an audience for an evenly matched, left-right debate show five times a week, in contrast to the partisan conformity that prevails at other cable outlets. besides mr. gingrich, the hosts will include s. e. cupp, a conservative columnist and commentator; and the liberals van jones, a former adviser to president obama; and stephanie cutter, a deputy manager of mr. obama's re-election campaign. the new show, which will start on sept. 16 at 6:30 p.m. and which is already being heavily promoted by the cable network, will feature two of the four hosts nightly, plus two guests. they will debate one topic for 30 minutes a counterintuitive gamble in an age of hummingbird attention spans. mr. gingrich, 70, is the marquee attraction. reviving \"crossfire\" with him as a host was one of the first ideas that jeff zucker floated on becoming president of cnn worldwide in january, said sam feist, cnn's washington bureau chief. mr. gingrich may be the only republican in america who believed the 20 primary debates in the 2012 campaign were too few. twice he brought his candidacy back from the dead through debate performances, most memorably in winning the south carolina primary by attacking the moderators for daring to question him about a) insensitivity to black americans and b) his second wife's statement that he asked for an open marriage. it was all quite calculated. \"particularly in a republican primary, taking on the media immediately resonated with almost half the primary voters,\" mr. gingrich said. that is a section of voters that cnn is eager to engage. during an onstage interview at the brainstorm tech conference in july, mr. zucker said: \"newt is an incredibly smart, intellectual thinker. i think, frankly, one of the criticisms of cnn that it didn't have enough conservative points of view on the air was probably a valid criticism.\" the renewed \"crossfire,\" which will displace the final 30 minutes of \"the situation room,\" is also an attempt to jump-start cnn's evening ratings. according to nielsen, \"the situation room\" averaged 621,000 viewers, compared with 2.1 million viewers for \"special report with bret baier\" on fox news and 565,000 for \"politicsnation\" on msnbc. cnn did proportionately better among the prized demographic, viewers aged 25 to 54 in the same hour. the numbers were 205,000 for cnn, 329,000 for fox news and 132,000 for msnbc. before he entered the 2012 race, mr. gingrich was a paid contributor to fox news, which chose not to bring him back after the election. \"i think they were shocked by the results,\" he said of fox news, which was widely seen as openly cheerleading for mr. romney last year. \"i think their audience was shocked. i think they've been trying to reassess how they're going to rebuild their programs.\" as a candidate who peddled his books at stump speeches, mr. gingrich was accused of running primarily to polish his brand for future book and television deals. \"if people want to think about that as a business decision, it would have been utterly irrational,\" he said in an interview at gingrich productions, in an office building in arlington, va. image from left, james carville, paul begala and tucker carlson on the original \"crossfire\" in 2002. credit john harrington/cnn, via reuters his 2010 income, disclosed during the campaign, was $3.1 million from speeches, books and consulting through a web of enterprises informally known as newt inc. as a candidate, his earnings \"basically collapsed to almost zero,\" he said. \"we've very gradually begun to rebuild.\" his suite of offices is relatively spare, with photographs on glass shelves and a library where books are arranged by height, not author. in a small personal office hangs a large photo of mr. gingrich's third wife, callista, riding a burro, and on his desk is a textbook, \"zoo animal welfare.\" to some, mr. gingrich is an object of semi-affectionate satire for his quirky interests in zoos and futuristic technology, and his prolific authorship that includes pulpy historical fiction. a recent onion headline declared, \"j. k. rowling revealed to be pseudonym for newt gingrich.\" in the last gasps of his primary run, journalists on his campaign bus wove his life and themes into parody songs such as \"rocket newt\"and \"sympathy for the gingrich.\" (sample lyric: \"but what's puzzling me is the failure of my campaign.\") in the 1980s and '90s he was one of the most frequent guests on \"crossfire.\" \"why did he get asked back over and over? because he was very good at it,\" mr. feist said. but it was another guest, jon stewart, whose 2004 appearance may be the best remembered. he accused the \"crossfire\"hosts tucker carlson and paul begala of being \"partisan hacks,\" adding that the show's bickering format was \"hurting america.\" the attack reverberated online. three months later mr. stewart's critique was cited by cnn's president in his decision to cancel the show. mr. gingrich had a different assessment of why the original show, which began in 1982, lost its way. at first, he said, it had well-informed guests who squarely engaged one another but later it devolved into head-butting for its own sake. \"it became more of a talking-points yelling match between people who thought the job was to be smarmy.\" another reason was that audiences were decamping for more one-sided politics, seeking the ideological comfort zones of fox news and later its liberal opposite, msnbc. mr. gingrich, as architect of the 1994 republican takeover of the house, who forced a government shutdown, helped to shape the modern age of hyper-partisanship. \"despite the polarization we've seen in america,\" mr. feist maintained, \"there are tens of millions of americans of all political stripes who actually don't want to hear a television network tell them how to think.\" mr. gingrich has long enjoyed discussing his intellectual influences fredrich hayek, adam smith, alvin toffler. his view of modern media is shaped by snooki, the \"jersey shore\" star. last year, he appeared with her on jay leno, \"which required me to become acquainted\" with the long-running mtv hit, he said. he realized that television had evolved so that niche shows could succeed by attracting just a sliver of the overall audience, he said. the new \"crossfire\" can succeed with just 1 percent of american viewers, he said. that may explain the screen saver on his iphone: mr. gingrich, his wife and snooki at the leno show. asked the inevitable question, whether he would use the cnn perch as a springboard to another campaign, he invoked the unpredictability of life. \"in a planet where things happen the way they do nowadays, who knows? if you'd have said three years ago, cnn is going to relaunch 'crossfire' and get gingrich to co-host it, who'd have guessed? things evolve.\"",

        "abstract": "manager willie randolph stood near the six televisions hanging from the ceiling in the center of the mets ' clubhouse yesterday, giving a speech he never dreamed he would have to give. the mets had just lost to the florida marlins, 8-1, just added a depressing exclamation point to a monumental collapse. the search for words as he addressed his team was emotional. randolph was no longer able to push or prod his players, so he told them that they had allowed a terrific chance to vanish. he told the players to remember how they felt at that precise moment, to remember how much losing this opportunity hurt. then randolph cried. two mets who witnessed randolph's five-minute speech said his eyes became moist and his voice weakened when he talked about what the team had destroyed by playing listlessly for two and a half weeks. the mets guaranteed that it would be a long, lonely, questioned-filled off-season. \"he was very emotional with us,\" said billy wagner, the team's closer. \"i'm sure if he had his way during this, he would have kicked the heck out of all of us.\" when randolph finished addressing his players, he made the 30-second walk to a conference room to speak to reporters. his white jersey was unbuttoned, he was carrying a bottle of water and he looked sad. actually, randolph looked like someone who had just finished wiping away the tears shed over a lost season. randolph said the mets had learned \"a tough life lesson in baseball,\" his euphemism for what a team finds out when it cannot protect a seven-game lead in the middle of september. the stunning finish of 12 losses in 17 games will consign the 2007 mets to baseball infamy. \"i told my players this is a life lesson in baseball and in how to become champions,\" randolph said. \"and, when you get to that road, you have to seize it because you never know when it's going to come again.\" while randolph has six world series rings from his career as a player and a coach with the yankees, his glitzy resume has a serious blemish. randolph was the man in charge of these mets, who now sit beside the 1964 phillies, the 1951 dodgers and the 1978 red sox as clubs that will be remembered for what they did not do. wagner said the mets knew they were not as talented as they were in 2006, something that should have led them to become more focused. instead, wagner said the players lost focus and behaved as if they expected to reach the playoffs. it is part of randolph's responsibility to make sure the mets stay focused. but david wright and wagner absolved randolph and said the players were culpable. \"to hear words like collapsing and choking associated with you, that's tough for willie to take,\" wagner said. \"willie's been a winner. he couldn't play for us, but i'm sure he wishes he could have. we didn't show up.\" but after this ending, speculation about randolph's job security will intensify. some fans chanted, \"fire willie! fire willie!\" in the ninth inning, but randolph has two years left on his contract and does not appear to be in danger of being dismissed. general manager omar minaya lauded randolph by saying that randolph \"turned our franchise around\" and that he and randolph are a \"team together.\" still, minaya left a smidgen of doubt about randolph's future by saying he has to discuss all organizational issues with ownership. randolph called himself \"a big boy\" who takes \"full responsibility\" for the collapse. that includes six losses in the last seven home games. that includes not being able to get jose reyes out of his funk. still, randolph said he was not concerned about losing his job. \"i'm here to teach these guys to play winning baseball,\" randolph said. \"when i don't do that, obviously, they're going to get rid of me, or whatever. so i don't have any qualms, any problems or any worries about stuff like that.\" before the game, a clubhouse attendant asked randolph about collecting his luggage for a potential trip to philadelphia. if the mets and phillies had each won or each lost yesterday, they would have had a playoff game at citizens bank park today. randolph told the young man he had a small bag and added, \"i'm not planning on going anywhere.\" randolph is not going anywhere, but it is not for the reasons that he had envisioned. he is not going anywhere because he and the mets went home. it was a perplexing ending to a shocking season. it was enough to make randolph cry.",

        "title": "garbage incinerators make comeback, kindling both garbage and debate.",
        "abstract": "west palm beach, fla. rising from a denuded landscape not far from this area's famed beaches, the nation's first new commercial garbage incinerator in 20 years is about to be fired up, ready to blast up to 3,000 tons of trash a day into electricity for thousands of houses. with landfills shunned, recycling programs stalled and the country's record-setting trash output unyielding, new waste-to-energy plants are being eyed as a path to salvation. facilities similar to the $670 million incinerator here, common in europe, are under consideration in massachusetts, nevada, virginia, wisconsin and elsewhere. americans produce 4.4 pounds of trash per person per day, the most in the world, and the talk of returning to incineration, industry experts say, is an acknowledgment of defeat in the effort to reduce output and step up recycling. \"people said 30 years ago there wouldn't be a need to have waste-to-energy sites,\" said ted michaels, president of the energy recovery council, a trade association, recalling optimism over garbage reduction and vast increases in recycling. today, few other options are available. but while the environmental protection agency has given its seal of approval by classifying the new plants as renewable energy akin to solar and wind power the facilities are an expensive and perhaps risky gamble. environmental groups oppose them, saying that although cleaner than the incinerators of the past, waste-to-energy plants still emit mercury, lead, dioxins and a variety of other toxic substances. and the history of incineration offers a cautionary tale, producing alarm among some who live nearby. in the curtis bay neighborhood of baltimore, for example, a waste-to-energy plant is being built at an expected cost of $1 billion, and concerns about its viability and health risks are mounting. video students from benjamin franklin high school in baltimore, md., are fighting the construction of a proposed waste-to-energy incinerator plant in their already highly toxic neighborhood, curtis bay. credit credit gabriella demczuk for the new york times maryland officials say that because it is privately financed, the facility is avoiding the financial risks that pushed cities including detroit , camden, n.j. , and harrisburg, pa. , toward insolvency after they built expensive incinerators designed to generate revenue through fees for handling garbage. but while the plant received approval from maryland and the blessings of gov. martin o'malley and mayor stephanie rawlings-blake, the operator, energy answers of albany, has had difficulty raising the money, and the plant is at least three years away from completion, said patrick f. mahoney, the company's chief executive. the plant will be even larger than the one about to open in west palm beach, able to combust 4,000 tons of material per day processed from residential garbage, wood, tires and the remains of automobiles. the problem is that curtis bay already hosts a 200-acre coal pier that produces black dust that collects on local streets and drifts inside windows, a fertilizer plant reeking of fresh manure, one of the nation's largest medical waste incinerators, chemical plants, fuel depots, and an open-air composting site. in 2009, the curtis bay zip code ranked among the top nationally for the release of toxic emissions more than 13.6 million pounds, according to the e.p.a. and baltimore, according to a 2013 report by the massachusetts institute of technology's laboratory for aviation and the environment, had the highest emissions-related mortality rate of 5,695 american cities studied. the m.i.t. report found that 130 of every 100,000 baltimore residents \"likely die in a given year due to long-term exposure to air pollution.\" the proposed facility would be allowed to emit up to 240 pounds of mercury and 1,000 pounds of lead annually in a neighborhood with three schools and high rates of cancer and asthma. donna harrison, 51, who bought a $64,000 house in curtis bay with her husband in 2010, said she often saw dead birds on the street. and she spoke of a smell she described as being \"like road kill all blended up and someone took the lid off.\" \"we thought about selling our house, but it's not feasible,\" she said. \"and now an incinerator? for the love of god. and not just an incinerator but the biggest damn incinerator in the united states. i feel i've taken my $64,000 and burned it.\" image in west palm beach, fla., a new garbage-to-energy plant is opening soon. it is to burn 3,000 tons of a trash a day. credit gabriella demczuk for the new york times other residents say they are eager for the plant to be built, in part because energy answers has pledged to create jobs and signed an agreement promising at least $50,000 a year to be used for job training, low-interest home loans, g.e.d. courses and new recreational facilities once the plant opens. the agreement includes a provision that would require energy answers to pay a fine directly to the community if emission standards were exceeded. andy dize, president of the community of curtis bay association, said the plant would be a clear boon to the neighborhood, given the agreement and the promised jobs. \"there's always got to be some give and take, and curtis bay will be worse off if this isn't built,\" he said. the florida plant, topped by an 80-foot smokestack, has encountered far less opposition, though there has been dissent over a plan to accept trash from outside palm beach county for at least eight years, until the county's population catches up with the incinerator's capacity. some residents have said the plant and the garbage trucks going back and forth along jog road could besmirch the area's reputation and harm tourism. \"do we really want to be the trash capital of south florida?\" asked donald e. gundermann, a west palm beach resident. he said he did not object to the incinerator, but did oppose importing garbage from outside the county. mark hammond, executive director of the county's solid waste authority, said the incinerator was the best available way to dispose of waste and a far better solution than placing a new landfill near the everglades, which was the county's original plan. \"this will be the cleanest waste-to-energy plant in the united states,\" mr. hammond said. the need to burn trash, say supporters, is underlined in the data: recycling rates have barely budged over the past decade the current level for recycling and composting is about 34 percent, according to the e.p.a. image in baltimore, members of the high school group free your voice canvassed the curtis bay neighborhood to stop a proposed waste-to-energy plant. the community already has a lot of industry. credit gabriella demczuk for the new york times though recycling rose steadily during the 1990s the national recycling and composting rate jumped to 31.4 percent in 2005 from 16 percent in 1990 curbside recycling has more recently been deemed an expensive luxury by a number of municipalities. thomas kinnaman , who studies the economics of solid waste and recycling at bucknell university, said public enthusiasm about recycling, once viewed as fashionable, had cooled. states, he said, now favor cheaper, easier options, which typically amount to either burying or burning garbage. \"some parts of the country realized it was costlier than they'd anticipated,\" he said, \"and it really comes down to economies of scale. the more people who take part, the less expensive it becomes.\" cities have adopted disparate policies, with ocean city, md. , having recently dispensed with curbside recycling altogether. instead, it trucks everything including plastic, glass, paper and other recyclables to an incinerator. the city says eliminating recycling has saved it $500,000 a year. indianapolis contracts with a company that charges a fee for curbside recycling, and the city incinerates most of the rest. the recycling rate is just 10 percent. portland , ore., which recycles about 60 percent of its garbage, collects household garbage just twice each month, but picks up recyclables and food scraps weekly. san francisco , which mandates both recycling and composting, says it diverts 80 percent of waste, and seattle , which recycles about 60 percent of its garbage, voted in september to impose fines on residents who fail to compost food waste. baltimore and palm beach county each have recycling rates of about 30 percent. if, as expected, the national rates continue to lag, new incinerators will probably be part of the solution. \"we've been building plants around the world, so the technology is there,\" said larry a. hiner, a manager with babcock & wilcox, the north carolina-based company building the florida plant. \"i think with education the public's perception of waste-to-energy will change. time is on our side.\"",

        "abstract": "palmyra, syria the imposing stone colonnades still stand, below stark hills dotted with tombs. they still glow peach-pink in the afternoon sun, impassive, as if unimpressed by what is, after all, not their first war. at the first-century temple of bel, one of the best-preserved buildings in the ancient city of palmyra , a prominent column bears a new scar. a mortar shell left a telltale splash mark on the stone, without budging a structure that has stood for 2,000 years. elsewhere, two other columns have collapsed, officials said, and bullets have pockmarked walls. but compared with the wholesale destruction that was feared, the damage, for now, is minimal. yet the war has left deeper, less obvious wounds. illegal digging, long a problem at the many sprawling archaeological sites in syria, has accelerated during three years of conflict. grave robbers, some crude, others professional, have stolen numerous objects from palmyra's tombs, museum officials say, sometimes sawing funeral friezes in two to make them easier to carry. another casualty is the town of tadmur, a jumble of concrete skirting the skeleton of the grander ancient city. its tourist economy has shut down. and for local people, who consider themselves custodians of one of the world's most magnificent ancient sites, there is a greater, if less tangible, pain. they yearn for the days when palmyra showed visitors from around the globe a vision of syria that transcended the region's modern-day strife, as a crossroad of greek, roman, persian and islamic cultures. archaeologists who worked among the ruins, now closed under military guard, still draw salaries. but they live bereft of an experience that had filled their days with beauty and meaning: excavating at dawn as the sunrise slowly lit the stones with gold. \"i feel as if i'm dead,\" said khalil al-hariri, an archaeologist and the director of the palmyra museum, near the ruins. he spends his time waiting for government permission to resume his early-morning explorations, and worrying about the plundering, which he says is \"destroying culture, destroying civilization.\" officials at unesco, the united nations agency that works to protect historic places, have classified as endangered all six of syria's world heritage sites, including palmyra. but conflict keeps them from assessing the damage in person. in recent weeks, as the government consolidated control of the desert highway to tadmur from the city of homs, it allowed journalists to visit, among the first outsiders to arrive since armed revolt spread to the region in late 2011. image a street vendor in tadmur, near palmyra. although the fighting has not damaged the ruins as much as feared, specialists have not yet been able to gain access to the site. credit sergey ponomarev for the new york times fighting came relatively late to this quiet desert town after protesters were fired on and a prominent army officer fell out with the government, residents say and flared sporadically for about a year. many insurgents were locals who hid in the orchards of an oasis adjoining the ruins, residents and security officials said. shelling and gunfire disrupted harvests and damaged trees. insurgents occupied the temple of bel, museum officials said, and looted a modern guesthouse there. the hotel zenobia, built in 1900 among the ruins, where visitors like agatha christie woke up to the sunrise striking the columns, stands burned and wrecked. now it is the syrian army using the ruins for military purposes. a 16th-century hilltop castle is off limits because, security officials said, \"the army is there,\" raising concerns among residents that heavy equipment could damage it. unesco says that artillery pieces and tanks have been positioned at the site. palmyra has escaped the catastrophic destruction visited upon the old city of aleppo , a battleground since the summer of 2012. shelling gutted medieval covered markets after insurgents took refuge there, and government troops are positioned in its 13th-century citadel. fighting has also damaged the crac des chevaliers , one of the world's best-preserved crusader castles, long occupied by insurgents and retaken last month by the government. image temples have stood in palmyra for thousands of years, and human habitation dates back much further. credit sergey ponomarev for the new york times nada al-hassan, chief of unesco's arab states unit, said the biggest danger to palmyra and other more remote sites was illegal digging by armed \"international mafias\" and, officials suspect, by insurgent and government fighters. she said that unesco was working with interpol, ordinary syrians and the \"committed, technocratic\" staff of the directorate general of antiquities and museums of syria to track damage and recover stolen artifacts. officials have intercepted hundreds of smuggled syrian antiquities in beirut, lebanon, including dozens from palmyra, and leading auction houses, like sotheby's, are cooperating to increase vigilance. unesco is looking into syrian government claims on a cache of medieval islamic coins proposed for sale by vcoin, an online auctioneer, ms. hassan said. but the united nations security council has yet to act on unesco's recommendation to ban all trade in syrian artifacts, as it did with those from iraq during the war there. \"now is not the time to sell syrian objects,\" ms. hassan said. \"anything syrian that is being sold now is suspicious.\" syria's 32 archaeological museums have packed away their collections, but objects have been looted from at least three. in raqqa, controlled by foreign-led islamist groups, some objects appear to have been destroyed out of religious objections to their pagan provenance or depiction of living creatures, said ahmad deeb, the director of museums at the ministry of culture. image now the ruins are mostly empty, except for soldiers perched on the stones. credit sergey ponomarev for the new york times antiquities have sometimes fared better in areas under the control of local syrian insurgents, who are more likely to understand and value them, officials said. (one bedouin insurgent who grew up in palmyra's ruins, tending camels, said he and his comrades left town to avoid damaging them.) and in maarat al-noaman, where rebels occupy a museum full of renowned mosaics, ms. hassan said, the government pays the fighters to preserve them. \"there are all sorts of deals,\" she said. temples have stood in palmyra for thousands of years, and human habitation dates back much further. successive civilizations included the brief third-century rule of queen zenobia, who revolted against the romans. many residents, including muslims, see that history as continuous with their own. \"inside us there is something very ancient and old,\" said sheikh ahmed dagher abu ali, a member of parliament, leading visitors through the otherwise empty museum to admire statues of palmyra's female deity allat and her greek equivalent athena. protecting that heritage from extremist insurgents less than 20 miles to the east is \"on our shoulders,\" he added. \"we are responsible on behalf of all the world's civilizations.\" now the bedouins and camels are gone, the ruins empty but for soldiers perched on the stones, smoking cigarettes. in the museum, a security official in an unmarked army-green uniform sat silently at the desk of the director, mr. hariri, who sat to the side. mr. hariri showed off four first-century sculptures recently confiscated from thieves. next, he pointed to friezes of bejeweled women hanging on the wall, his favorites, he said. asked why, he answered, \"because they are beautiful.\"",

while voters rate the performance of democrats negatively, they view republicans as even worse, providing a potential opening for democrats to make a last-ditch case for keeping their hold on power.

street and the bush administration than blame mr. obama for the country's economic problems. voters have a darker view of congressional republicans than of democrats, with 63 percent disapproving of democrats and 73 percent disapproving of republicans. but with less than two months remaining until election day, there are few signs that democrats have made gains persuading americans that they should keep control of congress. \"i really think we need to get some new blood in there,\" said kathy beckman, 44, an optometrist from lodi, calif., who spoke in an interview after participating in the poll. \"get them all out.\" the mood of the country is similar in many respects to the fall of 1994, when republicans swept control of congress. there is an overall low congressional approval, large numbers of americans who believe the country is on the wrong track and soaring discontent among voters with their own representative. it is that particular finding in the poll that underscores the true depths of the disgruntlement among the public and is an ominous sign for democrats, who have a 39-seat majority in the house and a 10-seat majority in the senate. in many election cycles, voters readily acknowledge that they are dissatisfied with government or congress in general, but they tend to have a stronger connection toward their own representative. that is not the case this year, with 55 percent of voters saying it is time for new leadership and only 34 percent saying their lawmaker deserves re-election. it is a historic high for a question asked in each midterm election year since 1990. the economic climate is also worse this year, with 8 in 10 americans rating the economy negatively and 4 in 10 saying that their family's financial situation is worse than it was two years ago. in september 1994, two months before democrats lost their majorities in the house and senate, more than half of people said the condition of the national economy was good. the economy and jobs are increasingly and overwhelmingly cited by americans as the most important problems facing the country, while the federal budget deficit barely registers as a topic of concern when survey respondents were asked to volunteer their worries. the national telephone poll was conducted friday through tuesday, the day that primary contests unfolded in seven states. the survey included 990 adults, of whom 881 were registered voters. the poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. voters do not perceive republicans as having better ideas and disagree with them on the biggest economic issue of the campaign whether to extend the bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy a sign the party has no real advantage on key pieces of their agenda, which makes it more necessary to run as a generic alternative to the party in power. the tea party movement , which showed its strength in republican primaries in delaware and new york, has yet to be fully defined for many americans. nearly half of voters say they are undecided or have not heard enough about the tea party to form an opinion, a sign that offers an opportunity for the movement to define itself to many voters and help shape their views of it before election day. nearly half of all republican voters say they have a favorable opinion of the tea party. but the view of the movement among independent voters grew more negative since a times/cbs poll was conducted in april. now, 30 percent of independent voters have an unfavorable view of the tea party, with 18 percent holding a favorable view and more than half offering no opinion. the president's overall job approval rating is 45 percent, with 47 percent disapproving. on the economy, his rating is worse, with 41 percent approving and 51 percent disapproving. when asked whether mr. obama has a clear plan for solving the nation's problems, 57 percent responded that he did not, yet twice as many give him more credit than republicans for having a plan. \"he had a lot of plans and he's not really sticking to them like he said he would,\" tammy danley, 38, an independent voter from louisburg, kan., said in an interview after participating in the poll. \"it seems like a lot of talk and not a lot of action.\" with the democratic majority on the line, and the outcome of the election seen as a referendum on the president, 45 percent of voters said mr. obama would not be a factor in their vote in november, while 23 percent said their vote would be for mr. obama and 25 percent said it would be against him. the poll found that the public has an increasingly negative opinion of sarah palin , the former alaska governor and 2008 republican vice-presidential nominee, with nearly half now holding an unfavorable view of her. her favorable rating is down nine percentage points since april. since then, she has increased her presence in the midterm election campaign, endorsing dozens of republican candidates across the country, most of whom were also backed by tea party activists. two-thirds of americans think that ms. palin's primary motivation is staying in the public eye, rather than helping conservative candidates get elected. \"i think she is trying to be more in the public eye for her own benefit,\" said kathy allen, 51, an unemployed worker from idaho falls, idaho , who spoke in an interview after participating in the poll, \"whether it be or financial purposes or in order to run for something again.\"",

        "title": "at 60 m.p.h., office work is high risk.",
        "abstract": "joplin, mo. looking back, paul dekok wonders what he was thinking that may morning when the urgent call came in. mr. dekok, a manager at the potash corporation, learned that a 25-ton truckload of the company's additive for livestock feed had been rejected by a customer as contaminated. scrambling to protect his company's credibility with a big customer, he grabbed his cellphone to arrange a new shipment, cradling it between his left ear and shoulder, and with his right hand e-mailed instructions to his staff from his laptop computer all while driving his rental car in a construction zone on a two-lane highway in north carolina . \"i thought i was doing a great job because i was being productive,\" mr. dekok said. \"it's an adrenaline rush. it's the buzz we all get of trying to do everything you can in business.\" but later, reflecting on the risks he took that spring day in 2007, he saw himself in a different light: \"i was bozo the clown.\" mr. dekok may be rethinking how he works on the road, but tens of thousands of americans barely give it a second thought. they have turned their cars, vans and trucks into mobile offices, wired with phones and computers to stay in close touch with bosses and customers. on wednesday, the transportation secretary, ray lahood , called the broader phenomenon of distracted driving a \"deadly epidemic\" at a meeting on the issue in washington . real estate brokers, pharmaceutical sales people, entrepreneurs, marketers and others say they have little choice but to transform their cars into cubicles. in this merciless economy, they say, they have to make every minute count, and respond instantly to opportunities and challenges. and they argue that the convenience of constant contact and the chance to tick off items from an endless to-do list while driving far outweigh what they think are slim chances that it could lead to a wreck. for white-collar employees, pressures to multitask are largely self-imposed. for blue-collar workers, the demands to stay connected while driving are often imposed by their bosses. truckers, plumbers, delivery drivers and others are tethered to dispatchers with an array of productivity devices, including on-board computers that send instructions about the next job and keep tabs on drivers' locations. such devices can require continual attention distracting drivers who are steering the biggest vehicles on american roads. the compulsion to work while driving often trumps clear evidence that such activity is dangerous. studies show that someone who talks on the phone while driving is four times more likely to crash, even using a hands-free headset, than someone who is simply driving. the risks are even greater when sending text messages . for all the perceived benefits of multitasking behind the wheel like staying a step ahead of competitors the dangers have begun to take their toll on companies, leading some to ban the practice by employees. some families of victims killed in collisions with a multitasking worker have successfully sued the driver's employer for tens of millions of dollars. researchers say there is another reason to question the benefits of working behind the wheel: a growing body of research shows that splitting attention between activities like working and driving often leads to distracted conversations and bad decisions. \"there is an illusion of productivity,\" said david e. meyer, a professor of psychology at the university of michigan . \"it's actually counterproductive.\" \"to the extent that someone is focused on driving, the quality of work product is diminished,\" he added. \"to the extent someone is focused on work and not driving, there's a risk of crashing and burning. something's got to give.\" the drive to compete potash, a large public fertilizer and chemical company, never told managers like mr. dekok, or regional salesmen like rob hudson, that they needed to multitask while driving. but given that both men drive an average of 150 miles each day visiting feed mills and other customers, their cars inevitably became rolling offices, the place where they call clients, plan meetings and make hotel reservations. \"i'd be on my cellphone, writing notes in my planner, driving with my knee, and with a sandwich in my lap,\" mr. hudson said. he felt he could not ignore his phone, he said, because he never knew which call or e-mail message would be one he could not miss. \"for the clients, a lot of times it's an urgent request for a delivery,\" he said. \"in the animal feed business, they never stop eating. it's not like that can wait until tomorrow.\" plenty of other workers feel similar pressures. idc, a market research firm, estimated last year that there were 111 million mobile workers in the united states , including all manner of people who do work outside an office, whether in a car, cafe, or airport lounge. and in a 2007 survey, idc found that 70 percent of owners of blackberrys and other smartphones used their device in a car at least once a week. (the survey did not specify whether the phone users were drivers or passengers, but 80 percent of people typically drive alone). \"it's a seconds-count economy,\" said sean ryan, an analyst at idc. mr. ryan feels the pressure. he schedules work calls to make his own 45-minute commute from boston to framingham, mass. more productive. at stop lights, he checks texts and e-mail messages. he does not want to miss something important, but he also sees the practice as a time saver. \"i might as well get a quick e-mail taken care of, or at least delete spam,\" he said. \"when i get to the office, i've saved 15 to 20 minutes of work.\" david vered, 53, chief executive of pacific yogurt partners, which operates golden spoon frozen yogurt stores in the san francisco bay area and helps manage other stores around the state, sometimes does not wait for stop lights to check his e-mail. he has trained employees to send concise messages so that he can read them while driving on the highway as he visits stores. \"with the blackberry, you can hold it up over the steering wheel,\" he said. \"i just hit 'open' and see what the issue is.\" on his lengthy commutes, he occasionally schedules calls with lawyers to do lease negotiations, or with contractors to discuss construction of a new retail outlet. but his phone can also ring with an urgent problem, like a broken frozen-yogurt machine. mr. vered's workers need to know what to do. if he delays, he said, they might be paralyzed, wasting time and money. \"i respond to them as rapidly as possible,\" he said. \"i don't like holding people up. and i'm not just holding them up: i'm paying them. i want them to be as effective as possible.\" studies show that drivers who send text or e-mail typically take their eyes off the road for an average of five seconds. but mr. vered said he was vigilant about safety. besides, he said, he never reads e-mail on his bigger laptop computer, which he keeps on a desk he has installed on the passenger seat of his small toyota s.u.v. \"that's dangerous because you have to shift the field of vision away from the road,\" he added. mr. vered said he was an adept multitasker. \"i'm in a zone,\" he said. he uses a bluetooth cellphone device attached to his ear so he can keep both hands on the wheel unless he is dialing or reading a text. \"i've done it my whole life, so i know how to multitask,\" he added. as his own boss, mr. vered can choose whether to multitask while driving. but other employees, particularly blue-collar workers, do not have that luxury. many employers deploy an array of devices to stay connected with their drivers at all times. the mobile office \"when someone's toilet overflows, they call a bunch of plumbers the first plumber there wins,\" said brian edds, a marketing director for xora, a company based in mountain view, calif. xora's software lets workers using mobile phones receive dispatch and navigation directions, deal with payroll, fill out invoices and otherwise manage their work as if they were sitting at a desk. idc, the research firm, estimates companies spent $850 million last year for such software from xora and its competitors, and estimated the market size would double in five years. the software has been installed on the phones of millions of electricians, service technicians, home health care workers, sales people, plumbers and others at companies like coca-cola , merck , pitney bowes and xerox , and the city of chicago . xora's customers include the roto-rooter services company, the plumbing chain. in the past, mr. edds said, a mobile worker might have had to scribble down directions from a dispatcher. \"now he gets sent the information in an organized manner, so he can click on the address, and get the best route, so he gets to a job very fast,\" he said. stephen r. poppe, chief information officer for roto-rooter, said that when employees turned on their device, it warned them not to use it while driving. but employees can bypass the warning, and mr. poppe conceded the company cannot stop them from doing so, \"it's like telling your daughter, 'don't talk while driving,' \" he said. \"she answers, 'sure, dad.' \" the company also needs quick responses from its plumbers. \"we want to know right this minute if they're going to take that job or not, or we'll assign the job to someone else,\" he said. \"we'll know within 60 seconds.\" mr. edds said that xora software included a standard warning screen urging users not to use it while driving. but he acknowledged that it could be ignored and often was. \"like the warning screens on in-dash navigation systems, most users treat them as a speed bump on their way to do what they want to do,\" he said. and sometimes a computer in the driver's seat can be a deadly distraction. unintended costs jered noe was driving a coca-cola delivery truck on a quiet stretch of two-lane highway in seminole county, okla., two novembers ago. samantha dawn earnest, with her three children, jason, 7; dakota, 5; and hailey, 4; was driving along the same road in the other direction in her green 1999 chevrolet malibu . in the back seat, jason and dakota talked about decorating the walls of their shared room. jason favored pictures of dinosaurs. dakota preferred horses. as ms. earnest crested a hill, the delivery truck swerved into her car, spun it around and sent it careening across the highway. jason died on impact. ms. earnest, stunned and bleeding, saw the truck driver walking toward her. \"i said, 'why, why, why?' \" she recalled screaming at him. \"he told me, 'i just took my eyes off the road for a second because i was looking at my computer.' \" she started chasing him. \"i went into a mad rage,\" she said. \"if he'd said he'd fallen asleep, maybe i'd have understood. but using a computer?\" mr. noe, 24, received a suspended sentence for negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, and the earnest family sued mr. noe's employer, the ada coca-cola bottling company. the company settled, and the terms of the agreement are confidential. ada did not respond to requests for comment. lawyers and expert witnesses in cases involving multitasking drivers say such lawsuits are common. last year, international paper reached a settlement to pay $5.2 million because of a 2006 accident in which an employee on a phone hit another driver, whose arm had to be amputated. katherine mcarthur, a lawyer in macon , ga., who sued international paper in that case, said the company permitted employees to use a cellphone while driving if it had a hands-free headset. (this remains the company policy, according to international paper). but ms. mcarthur said that several studies show that drivers using headsets face the same likelihood of crashing as someone holding the phone to their ear. that risk has been compared to driving at the legal limit for intoxication. \"what i'm arguing in these cases is that these companies are authorizing something as bad as drunk driving and that they knew about the research or should have known,\" she said. ms. mcarthur said that companies should expect more such lawsuits. \"they're the deep pockets,\" she said. some may pay before an accident even happens. insurance executives say that when setting premiums the industry has started to consider whether companies have policies on cellphone use. the calculus there might be another reason for drivers to reconsider working behind the wheel: a growing body of studies suggest that such work may be less valuable than many people assume. the reason, researchers say, is that the brain can effectively perform only one difficult task at a time. mr. meyer, the michigan professor, found that when someone tried to multitask, important neural regions must switch back and forth, taking time and creating inefficiencies. that can be particularly dangerous, of course, when a driver suddenly feels the tires slipping on an icy road in the middle of a phone call. but that 2001 study, and numerous others, also show that multitasking motorists can pay another price in the quality of their work. in 2006, for instance, researchers at university of california , los angeles , used brain imaging to show that multitaskers were less effective learners. according to that research, a person focused on a single task remembers what he has learned using the hippocampus, a part of the brain critical to storing and recalling information. but when that person multitasks like trying to learn something new while driving the brain relies more on the striatum, a part of the brain used more for learning motor skills. the researchers concluded, \"don't multitask while you are trying to learn something new you hope to remember.\" \"the brain is fundamentally built to unitask,\" said clifford nass, a communications professor at stanford, where he is also a co-director of a new automotive research laboratory. that limitation can put drivers at a disadvantage if they are negotiating with someone who, say, is in an office and less distracted. driving, mr. nass said, taxes the parts of the brain that make it more difficult to appreciate nuances of a conversation. \"a person is much more manipulatable when they're behind the wheel,\" he said. mr. nass said that the counterproductive effects can linger after the ride. research shows that the brains of heavy multitaskers can become so accustomed to hopping from task to task that they have trouble focusing on longer, more in-depth ones. some companies have weighed several factors including the safety risks and the cost of potential lawsuits and banned employees from doing work on their phones behind the wheel. (in a survey taken in august of its 13,000 member companies, the national safety council found 469 with such bans.) some corporations that have imposed the bans have found that productivity has not suffered. amec, an international engineering and project management company, banned its 9,000 north american workers, starting in 2005, from talking on the phone while driving a decision the company made after executives heard about a fatal accident caused by a driver talking on a cellphone. amec surveyed its workers a year later, asking them to respond anonymously to encourage candor, and 95 percent said their productivity had not been affected. in 2004, exxon mobil started asking the same question after it became concerned about the safety of its 90,000 workers and 100,000 contract workers, who drove up to 1.5 million miles each day, said michael henderek, the company's safety executive at the time. the company wanted to know what a ban would do to the bottom line. \"exxon mobil is a corporation in which 50 percent of employees are engineers,\" said mr. henderek. \"it's driven by data.\" the company determined that research equating the dangers of behind-the-wheel multitasking with drunken driving was reliable. so in early 2004, exxon mobil ran a pilot project, restricting some employees from using the phone while driving. it found no loss in productivity, and quickly imposed a ban for all workers and contractors. \"to not act was irresponsible,\" mr. henderek said. \"the risk to employees was much greater than any marginal benefit of the productivity you get.\" exxon mobil was particularly concerned about its big fuel trucks. \"the last thing you want to have,\" mr. henderek said, \"is an incident between the fuel fleet and the community.\" tragedy begets a change last march, potash's chief executive, william j. doyle, attended a conference in bahrain that focused on safety in the fertilizer industry. he was particularly moved by a harrowing speech not about chemical safety, but distracted driving. before day's end, mr. doyle had sent an e-mail message to several potash executives telling them the company needed to change its policy. \"it said, 'we have to get a cellphone policy in place. we can't subject people to this anymore,' \" john hunt, potash's executive in charge of safety, health and environment, recalled. on april 1, potash banned its 5,000 workers from using their phones while driving, telling them they could be fired if they broke the rule. \"there's always an extra 15 or 30 minutes where someone can pull the car over to place a call. nothing is that critical,\" mr. hunt said, explaining the policy. mr. dekok, the manager, was skeptical. but his grudging acceptance vanished when he heard a speech by david teater, an executive with the national safety council, which has made a cause of eliminating driver distraction. this year, as part of that, the group began an effort to get corporations representing one million workers to ban their employees from using cellphones while driving. at the invitation of potash, mr. teater, 53, a former college football player with an easygoing manner, recently gave company workers and their families a version of the stump speech he has given dozens of times. over 40 minutes, mr. teater detailed the increased risks drivers face when multitasking. he talked about cognitive distraction and the need for stronger laws. he thanked potash for being a leader and urged the audience to tell others to rethink their priorities. \"we don't need our phones as much as we think we do,\" he said. then mr. teater, his audience already rapt, showed pictures on a projector of people who had been killed by multitasking drivers. the last photo he showed was of a 12-year-old blond boy, smiling it was joe teater, mr. teater's son. on martin luther king day in 2004, a driver talking on a cellphone on her way to church hit the teaters' car, killing joe and injuring his mother, who was driving. (after his son's death, mr. teater worked 18 months for a company that is developing technology that can prevent a driver from using a cellphone while the car is in motion, and he still owns shares in the company.) many of the potash employees teared up as mr. teater concluded. they thanked him, and said they would change their behavior and urge friends and family to do the same. mr. hudson, the potash salesman, still wishes there could be some compromise on the policy. he acknowledged that he has had more than a few scary moments in the past when he's \"swerved off the beaten path\" while multitasking. but he still feels drive time should be productive. \"you'd think we could have some leeway on the highway when you're on open road and you're wide awake,\" he said. \"it's a little over the top to have a 100 percent ban. but then, where do you draw the line?\" for mr. dekok, the line is now clear. if he is driving and the phone rings, he lets it go to voicemail. he knows every rest stop on his routes, and which ones have good cellular and wi-fi service. he does not drive more than 30 miles without stopping to respond to messages. and he delegates more authority to subordinates so they can deal with problems when he is on the road. business is just as urgent as it always has been, but he has a new view of the calculus. \"after you go cold turkey, and get rid of the cellphone when you drive, you see other people's behavior,\" he said. \"it's like getting sober and realizing everyone else is still drunk.\"",

        "abstract": "kim clijsters did not play a single match on tour in february after her disastrous and somewhat inexplicable loss to nadia petrova in the third round of the australian open. had it occurred five years earlier, clijsters would probably have been on the next flight to a smaller event in memphis, dubai or paris to regain her form. these days, however, the 26-year-old clijsters has a much different list of priorities. \"my main concern is to prevent injuries and be mentally fresh for each tournament,\" clijsters said monday. \"i'm focused on being a wife, a mother and an athlete.\" this past week, clijsters and her husband, brian lynch, brought their daughter, jada, to new york to celebrate her second birthday. on monday night, clijsters played in the billie jean king cup at madison square garden, her first trip to the garden in nearly 10 years. she lost to venus williams, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. \"now i'm going back as a mother,\" clijsters said. \"this kind of event is really special and i'm inspired to be there.\" when clijsters won the united states open last september in only her third tournament after a two-year layoff, a period when she gave birth to jada, she was praised for her steely nerve and her improved pressure-point play. \"i thought she was brilliant in new york,\" the hall of famer virginia wade said. \"her ability to dig deep and her fortitude were tremendous.\" such fortitude was partly credited to motherhood, but there is an uncertainty if clijsters can maintain a high level of play while competing in fewer tournaments. \"i think it's going to be a little bit harder for her to drop in and play out of her mind like she played at the u.s. open,\" wade said. monday's garden exhibition served as a sort of prelude to the start of the north american women's tour this month, with tournaments in indian wells, calif., and key biscayne, fla. \"it will help me with indian wells,\" clijsters said. \"in my first career there were plenty of easy scores, but now early rounds are just as tough. lots of the top players have to be aware that the young up-and-comers are eager to beat us.\" in a drive put on by the united states tennis association to coincide with the garden exhibition, novice players got the chance to sign up to play tennis at hundreds of public facilities, park and recreation agencies and commercial clubs as a part of tennis night in america. \"historically, we've used may to promote what we call tennis month,\" said kurt kamperman, the chief executive of community tennis for the u.s.t.a. \"tying in to this event allowed us to extend the season.\" there are 735 facilities across the country that have registered thousands of children for spring and summer tennis programs. the u.s.t.a. has also introduced a new teaching initiative, quikstart, that kamperman hoped would attract more young players to the game. \"we realized that kids today want to play earlier, younger,\" kamperman said. \"quikstart allows parents to be engaged with their kids, set up a makeshift net in the driveway and get hooked.\" as for clijsters's daughter, her involvement with tennis comes in the form of rounding out her mother's second career. clijsters tries to have breakfast with jada or spend a few hours with her on off days. on this trip, they went on a carriage ride in central park. \"jada is a good kid,\" clijsters said. \"she sleeps well and doesn't take too long to adjust.\" something clijsters, too, is trying to do a second time around.",

        "title": "most health insurance co-ops are losing money, federal audit finds.",
        "abstract": "washington most federal insurance cooperatives created under the affordable care act are losing money and could have difficulty repaying millions of dollars in federal loans, an internal government audit has found, prompting the obama administration to step up supervision of the carriers. daniel r. levinson, the inspector general at the department of health and human services, said that most of the insurance co-ops enrolled fewer people than they had predicted, and that 22 of the 23 co-ops lost money last year. even as overall enrollments for insurance have increased, many of the co-ops are still losing money, a review of 2015 data by federal health officials shows. in february, the iowa insurance commissioner moved to shut down a nonprofit co-op insurer, cooportunity health , created with $145 million in federal loans, and a state court found it insolvent because of \"adverse claims experience.\" another carrier, the louisiana health cooperative, started with $65 million in federal loans, said it would voluntarily halt operations at the end of this year. the louisiana co-op was \"not growing fast enough to maintain a healthy future,\" said greg cromer, the chief executive of the louisiana plan who is also a republican state legislator and chairman of the house insurance committee. over all, co-ops have received $2.4 billion in federal loans to help pay start-up costs and to meet state solvency requirements. \"the low enrollments and net losses might limit the ability of some co-ops to repay start-up and solvency loans and to remain viable and sustainable,\" mr. levinson said in a report analyzing the insurers' financial condition. andrew m. slavitt, the acting administrator at the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services, said his agency \"has recently increased the data and financial reporting requirements for co-ops.\" as part of their stepped-up supervision, administration officials said that six co-ops were on an informal watch list. the government is closely monitoring their operations and financial status and has warned them about performance problems or required them to take corrective action. the officials refused to identify the co-ops subject to what they call \"enhanced oversight.\" congress authorized the co-ops to increase competition in state insurance markets and to create additional choices for consumers, with the hope of holding down premiums. dr. martin e. hickey, the chief executive of the new mexico co-op, who is also chairman of the national alliance of state health co-ops, said it was unrealistic to expect them to achieve a surplus right away. \"this is inherently a risky venture, a tough, tough business,\" dr. hickey said. \"there will likely be a handful of co-ops that fail. i don't deny that. but you will probably see the red ink disappear for some plans starting next year.\" susan dunlap, a spokeswoman for the kentucky health cooperative, said that 52,000 people were now enrolled in its plans, down from 56,680 at the end of last year. but, she said, the co-op still has more than half of all the people who obtained coverage through the state's insurance exchange. the kentucky plan lost $50 million last year, more than any other insurance co-op, as it paid out $1.25 in claims for every dollar it collected in premiums. \"we attracted many consumers with serious illnesses,\" ms. dunlap said. \"one of our most popular plans had low premiums, low out-of-pocket costs and a large network of providers. it's difficult, it's uphill, but we are energetic and hopeful. trends are going in the right direction.\" the kentucky insurance commissioner recently approved rate increases averaging 25 percent for the kentucky health cooperative in 2016. the co-op said the additional revenue would help reduce its losses. at the same time, the inspector general found that a few co-ops had done exceptionally well. the one in maine, community health options, has captured more than half of the market and achieved a surplus, with revenues exceeding expenses by $5.9 million last year. the new york co-op, health republic insurance, lost money, but it signed up 155,400 people, five times its projected enrollment and far more than any other co-op. michael j. fagan, a spokesman for health republic, said that the carrier lost $77.5 million on premium revenue of $521 million last year, for a \"negative margin\" of 14.8 percent. but, he said, \"the co-ops were never intended to be profitable in their first three years.\" even as some of the co-ops were losing money, tax returns show that their executives were paid sizable salaries. for example, the south carolina co-op, the consumers' choice health plan, paid its top two executives $458,196 and $351,710 in 2013, according to the return it filed as a tax-exempt organization in november 2014. the nevada co-op reported paying its top executive $340,000. jerry w. burgess, the president of the south carolina co-op, said: \"i am not overpaid. my compensation is similar to that at nonprofit health care enterprises of similar size.\" mr. burgess is also president of the tennessee co-op, which he said pays half his salary. enrollment in the south carolina co-op stands at 70,000, up from 46,000 at the end of last year, mr. burgess said. \"we are still losing money,\" he said, \"but will break even in 2016.\" likewise, tom zumtobel, the chief executive of the arizona co-op, meritus health partners, said it lost $7.2 million in 2014 and was projecting a loss of $6.7 million this year, but would operate in the black next year. health insurance co-ops are generally governed by their members. the affordable care act says they cannot use federal loan funds for marketing. co-op executives said this put them at a disadvantage in competing against well-known brands like blue cross and blue shield, aetna and humana.",

        "title": "dynamics are shifting in an 8-member supreme court.",
        "abstract": "washington it was february, and justice antonin scalia had just died. responding to a question about how the supreme court would cope with just eight members, justice samuel a. alito jr. was sanguine. \"we will deal with it,\" he said. now it is april, and it is possible to start to assess how a short-handed court is dealing with its work. it has started to deadlock in closely divided cases. that happened twice last month, in a minor case on bank guarantees and a major one on public unions. \"with almost 50 cases still on the docket for the term, the supreme court could set a record for most tie votes,\" said justin pidot , a law professor at the university of denver and the author of a study of supreme court deadlocks to be published in the minnesota law review . \"no term since 1990 has included more than two tie votes, a benchmark the court has now hit in a single week.\" such ties give rise to a judicial anticlimax. the court issues an unsigned opinion containing a single sentence: \"the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.\" that means the appeals court decision under review remains in place. the supreme court itself sets no national precedent, and a legal issue important enough to have warranted a scarce spot on the court's docket remains unresolved. but these deadlocks are just one aspect of a new judicial dynamic, one that threatens to limit the court's reach. the court's docket, already small by the standards of recent history, seems poised to shrink even further. in 1986, when justice scalia joined the court, it decided about 175 cases. in his last full term, which ended in june, the number had dropped to 75. it takes four votes to add a case to the court's docket, and simple math suggests that with one vote fewer available, fewer petitions will be granted. the justices, moreover, will be unlikely to vote to hear cases fated to end in the waste of time that is a 4-to-4 split. in march, the court agreed to hear just two cases. one concerned patents, the other double jeopardy. neither qualified as a blockbuster. the previous march, the justices agreed to hear nine cases, among them important ones on the death penalty and on sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders . another was the banking case that ended in a deadlock last month. oral arguments have changed, too. justice scalia was the court's most active questioner, and arguments without him have been somewhat wan and tepid. his jokes were not to everyone's taste, but they enlivened what can be dry affairs. how a vacancy on the supreme court affected cases in the 2015-16 term the empty seat left by justice antonin scalia's death leaves the court with two basic options for cases left on the docket this term if the justices are deadlocked at 4 to 4. \"scalia was in a whole other league when it came to getting laughs at oral argument,\" said jay d. wexler , a law professor at boston university and a leading authority on supreme court humor. \"if the court were a high school baseball program, scalia was the ace of the varsity pitching staff, and everyone else played third-string utility infield for the j.v. squad.\" transcripts of supreme court arguments include the notation [laughter] when there is audible levity, and they allow professor wexler to keep detailed statistics. in recent weeks, he found, justice stephen g. breyer has generated far more laughs than any other member of the court. \"since scalia's death, breyer has pretty much cemented his position as the new funny guy of the bench,\" professor wexler said. but the laughs are different now. \"scalia's humor was basically quip-based, fast one-liners,\" professor wexler said, \"whereas breyer's are often connected in some way to his long, circuitous hypotheticals.\" justice scalia's absence has allowed other justices more room to express themselves, said adam feldman , a doctoral candidate in political science at the university of southern california who used linguistic software to analyze transcripts of recent arguments. \"without justice scalia consistently inserting himself into the conversation, there was a void for the other justices to fill,\" mr. feldman said, adding that justice sonia sotomayor had seized the opening. \"justice sotomayor usurped justice scalia's spot taking the most turns talking.\" justice sotomayor and the rest of the court's four-member liberal wing have gained new power. they tend to vote together, so they can block conservative rulings but can achieve liberal ones if they pick up an additional vote. such a vote might come from justice anthony m. kennedy, who was at the court's ideological center until justice scalia's death, or from chief justice john g. roberts jr., who assigns the writing of the opinion for the court if he is in the majority. the other conservatives justices alito and clarence thomas have started to cement an extraordinary bond, staking out positions to the right of the rest in a remarkable series of two-man opinions. they dissented from the court's decision not to hear a challenge to a colorado law allowing the recreational use of marijuana. they said the court had acted rashly in reversing the conviction of a louisiana death row inmate because of prosecutorial misconduct. they dissented from a ruling in favor of workers at a slaughterhouse who had sought overtime pay. they criticized the majority for not going further in handing gun rights groups a second amendment victory in a massachusetts case concerning stun guns. and they added boilerplate concurrences when the court returned more than 40 cases involving juvenile offenders to lower courts. the concurrences recited various grounds on which the courts could still rule against juvenile offenders sentenced to life without parole notwithstanding a january decision that had seemed to give them a fresh shot at eventual release. all of those joint opinions from justices alito and thomas were issued over 15 days in march. monday's voting rights decision was unanimous, but even there two members refused to endorse the majority's reasoning: justices thomas and alito. in february, justice alito said the court would have to adapt to the \"great shock\" of justice scalia's death. \"we'll see what develops,\" he said. what has developed is a court transformed, partly paralyzed and, for now, diminished in the role it can play in the life of the nation.",

        "title": "when bell sounds, surgeon answers ringside calling.",
        "abstract": "one recent friday, the orthopedic surgeon victor khabie performed seven operations, grabbed a sandwich and fought traffic to a ballroom in queens to care for athletes who walked willingly into fists. they call themselves boxers. khabie calls them patients. this presents a contradiction for khabie and other doctors who moonlight as ringside physicians. they come from the world of medicine, which is predicated on healing, into the world of boxing, which is predicated on pain. khabie must reconcile these worlds, for a few hundred dollars a fight, while his patients cut, bruise and disfigure each other for sport. \"it's tough, but we do the best we can for them,\" khabie said. \"if society says we don't want boxing, then i wouldn't be taking care of boxers. but i'm not a politician. i do know these boxers need help, these boxers are hurt, and often they have no one to take care of them.\" on saturday, the heavyweight champion wladimir klitschko defeated david haye in germany in a fight shown on hbo. khabie watched both boxers and the physicians who watched over them. in 2006, he examined klitschko before a bout at madison square garden. that fight, with the boxer laila ali on the undercard and her father, muhammad ali, in attendance, served as a career highlight. just like the time evander holyfield raised his left glove between rounds when khabie instructed him to lift his right, inadvertently smacking khabie in the face. khabie long ago learned the violence inherent in his favorite sport. he tried boxing with a friend and ended up with broken ribs. his wife, brenda, told khabie: \"you're a surgeon. you need those hands.\" but she also understood that the violence, so different from his daily routines, drew him ringside in the first place. \"if he wasn't a surgeon,\" she said, \"he'd be a boxer.\" by day, khabie can be found in mount kisco, n.y., where he is the chief of sports medicine at northern westchester hospital and also helps operate the somers orthopedic surgery and sports medicine group. on fight nights, he makes a mental switch, from repairer of torn ligaments and busted knees to caretaker of battered faces, from central figure in the operating room to anonymous face at ringside. khabie described his job like this: between rounds, he fights through camera crews and trainers into a designated corner, where he attempts to pepper a boxer who is often injured and trying to catch his breath with questions for 10 to 15 seconds. he then makes a decision on whether the bout should continue, one he must live with through the next round. if all goes well, khabie operates unseen. this being boxing, \"all goes well\" means none of the combatants end up in the hospital. those are the fights that stick with khabie, that keep him awake at night, like a bout a few years ago at a beer garden on long island where a boxer was knocked unconscious. for five minutes that felt like five hours, the boxer did not move. khabie never expected to work in boxing, but knew early he would become a doctor, even back in boy scouts when his favorite tasks included constructing a bandage in the woods. a longtime sports fan, he entered orthopedics because they combined both passions, because the first time he removed a screw from a leg, his instructors asked not about removal technique, but about a football game the night before. after college at the university of pennsylvania and harvard medical school, khabie worked at the kerlan-jobe orthopedic clinic in california. there, he served as assistant physician for the professional sports teams in los angeles. lakers center shaquille o'neal occasionally pulled pranks on him. khabie enjoyed caring for athletes (as an assistant doctor, he examined and called in a prescription for the tennis champion steffi graf at the united states open ). but boxing, with no place to hide, all the energy and raw aggression, drew him in. his first bout as a ringside physician took place at a cafe in the bronx, which later became a red lobster and had a makeshift ring inside. on the recent friday in queens, khabie called his work typical: eight fights, three boxers knocked down, two repeatedly, one serious gash opened by a head butt. in one bout, bryan abraham sent scott burrell to the canvas four times. each time, khabie scurried into the ring. because burrell rose quickly from each knockdown, because he remained relatively calm, khabie let the fight continue. (khabie finds that fighters who become overly emotional, begging to continue, usually need to be stopped.) khabie paid particular attention two fights later. he knew that one boxer, carlos cisneros, was 35, with 17 losses in 27 previous fights. (cisneros lost by knockout.) as khabie attended to cisneros, the surgeon from westchester appeared at home. \"he likes to have that peacefulness and that action,\" his brother, dan khabie, said. \"that's very much our personality. at home, we're relaxed and civilized. put us in a ring, and we'll go nuts.\" yet part of khabie's role as ringside physician includes making an unsafe sport more safe, or trying to. he echoed melvina lathan, the chairwoman of the new york state athletic commission, who noted the rules governing fights in new york were more stringent than most states, if not all. khabie spoke of the wide range of specialists available to boxers (orthopedists, oral surgeons, eye doctors, plastic surgeons) and the seminars they conduct each year. khabie said doctors began using more sophisticated magnetic resonance imaging testing in recent years. research has been conducted on whether larger gloves would reduce the force of blows. fighters are also required to have brain testing every three years, yearly eye and heart exams, and blood work and mental exams before each fight. but they will never be truly safe. \"boxing is a violent sport,\" khabie said. \"but like football, it can be made safer. we've had 60-day suspensions for concussions. imagine that in football. we've taken every precaution we possibly can. but, unfortunately, people will get hurt.\" recently, an 80-year-old amateur traveled to khabie's office, certain that if any doctor would clear him to fight, it would be a boxing one. khabie did not clear the man, but he returned a few months later and dropped the belt he won on khabie's desk. so goes the life of a ringside physician, where safety is both relative and paramount.",

        "title": "after joe maddon, kevin cash takes charge.",
        "abstract": "tampa, fla. kevin cash said he was honored to meet cal ripken jr. last week, but he is too young to recall ripken's sensational rookie season of 1982 or the next year, when the orioles won the world series. cash's first major league baseball memory is of pete rose breaking the career hit record in 1985, when cash was 7. thirty years later, with the tampa bay rays, he is the youngest manager in baseball, facing two monumental challenges. first, he is following the successful tenure of the charismatic joe maddon, now the chicago cubs' manager. and cash, in his first managerial job at any level including little league will have to match wits with a group of respected managers in the american league east, including the baltimore orioles' buck showalter and the yankees' joe girardi, who have thousands of games of experience between them. \"it's a unique situation in the a.l. east,\" said cash, who was a catcher for three of the managers in the division and played against showalter's teams. \"to me it's as good a division as there is in baseball.\" cash, though, is not only the youngest manager in baseball; he is the youngest manager or head coach in any of the four major pro sports leagues. the next youngest, at 38, is brad stevens, the boston celtics' coach. cash is so young that in a spring training game on monday, he was managing against two players who are older than he is: alex rodriguez, cash's yankees teammate in 2009, who is 39, and carlos beltran, who will turn 38 on april 24. cash will not be 38 until dec. 6. he may not remember those orioles teams of his youth, but rodriguez does. \"are you saying i'm old?\" rodriguez said monday when notified of their age difference. \"that is a really strange feeling for me. but i think he's going to do a great job over there. he's really smart, and he's definitely a people person.\" none of cash's players are older than he is, but some are not too far behind: reliever grant balfour was born 24 days later. another pitcher, ernesto frieri, who broke in with the san diego padres in 2009, is only seven years cash's junior. \"he is good,\" frieri said. \"he knows what it is to be a player, but he talks like a real manager.\" several managers cash could end up tangling with are old enough to have been playing at the time of his early baseball consciousness. that includes bruce bochy, now san francisco's manager, who was the padres' catcher in the game in which rose broke the hit record. bochy will turn 60 on april 16. but he is not the oldest manager in the majors. that distinction goes to the mets' terry collins, 65, who started his managing career in the minor leagues the year cash turned 4. showalter, 58, played his final season in the minor leagues two years later. showalter has managed 2,421 regular-season games in the majors. cash has five exhibition games on his resume, including monday's 4-3 loss to the yankees. image cash, with the yankees in 2009, was a catcher for three of the managers he will face in the american league east. credit jim mcisaac/getty images \"hey, i've been at it a month already,\" he joked. \"yes, i'm young, but tom foley will be standing right next to me, talking over every pitch of every inning,\" cash added, referring to his bench coach, who is serving under a fourth manager since he joined the major league club in 2001. \"that's going to help a ton.\" cash's predecessor, maddon, won 754 games over nine seasons with tampa bay and led the rays to the a.l. pennant in 2008. he was known for innovations like expanding the use of infield shifts, as well as for team-building novelties, like bringing penguins into the clubhouse. cash is as personable as maddon but knows he must be himself: there will not be any penguins around, for instance. still, he is not looking to change the entire culture of what has been a successful organization. \"what joe did was incredible here,\" cash said. \"i think you embrace it. how lucky am i to be walking into a situation that was already so good to begin with? \"i don't like changes. i think there will be adjustments here and there, but i feel lucky to have come to a place with such a solid foundation.\" cash, who had an eight-year major league career that ended in 2010, played under maddon in 2005, appearing in 13 games for the rays. he also played a handful of games with the blue jays in 2004 under john gibbons, who is again toronto's manager. john farrell, now the red sox' manager, was boston's pitching coach when cash was a backup with the team in 2007, 2008 and 2010. cash's biggest influence in boston, though, was terry francona, then the red sox' manager, who later picked cash to be cleveland's bullpen coach after the indians hired francona for the 2013 season. the idea was always for cash to learn the art of managing. \"i watched tito closely,\" cash said, referring to francona. \"his handling the media, communicating with players, making moves, all those things. i could not have asked for a better mentor.\" at every stop he made as a player, including tampa bay, cash made an impression. girardi, who managed cash in 2009, when cash appeared in 10 games for the yankees, said he could tell that cash had the makings of a manager. he is smart and confident enough to lead a team, which is why the rays made sure to hire him before the texas rangers, who interviewed him in october, had the chance. across the league, teams no longer hesitate to hire former players with no managing experience. minnesota hired paul molitor in november, and girardi was new to managing when the marlins turned to him for the 2006 season. a. j. hinch, now with houston, was only 34 when he was hired by arizona in 2009. \"ownership groups aren't afraid to go to young managers today,\" girardi said. \"the game has changed a little bit in that sense. it happened to me.\" cash will have many opportunities this year to face off with girardi and some of his elders who are still playing. \"hey, for him that's good,\" beltran said. \"if he does well, he can manage for a long time.\"",

        "title": "giffords's husband delivers a message: 'she's a fighter'.",
        "abstract": "this article is by michael luo , sam dolnick and jennifer medina . tucson on a day when representative gabrielle giffords 's condition was upgraded to serious from critical, her husband, mark kelly, spoke publicly for the first time on sunday. he left his wife's hospital bedside to take the stage at a memorial service for gabriel zimmerman , an aide who was killed in the shooting rampage that left ms. giffords grievously wounded. mr. kelly told the several hundred mourners gathered in the courtyard at the tucson museum of art that he had just come from the hospital and that his wife was \"improving a little bit each day. she's a fighter.\" \"i know someday she'll get to tell you how she felt about gabe herself,\" mr. kelly said. his wife loved mr. zimmerman \"like a younger brother,\" he said, and was inspired by \"his idealism, his strength and his warmth.\" at almost the exact same time, about a half-hour's drive east, another shooting victim dorwan stoddard , 76, known as dory to friends was eulogized at a church filled with hundreds of mourners. \"there are no monuments to dory, there are no streets named after him,\" said the rev. mike nowak, his pastor. \"he was just an ordinary man. he did not become a hero that day he was a hero every day of his life.\" at university medical center, officials said on sunday that ms. giffords's condition was upgraded because she was no longer on a ventilator. doctors announced on saturday that they placed a tracheotomy tube in ms. giffords's throat as a precautionary measure. \"the congresswoman continues to do well,\" a spokeswoman said in a statement. \"she is breathing on her own. yesterday's procedures were successful and uneventful.\" jared l. loughner , the man charged in the shooting that left six dead and 13 wounded, is in the custody of federal marshals at the medium-security federal correctional institution in phoenix, which houses almost 1,100 prisoners about 25 miles north of downtown. according to an official familiar with the prison, mr. loughner, who federal records say is registered as inmate no. 15213-196, is being held in \"segregation\" for his own protection. prisoners in segregation are closely monitored, the official said, and generally spend 23 hours of the day alone in their cells and have an hour or so a day for exercise and showering. mr. loughner, 22, has no contact with other prisoners, said the official, who added that the prison's past inmates included salvatore gravano, the mafia informer and hit man known as sammy the bull. the funerals on sunday marked the fourth and fifth for victims of the shooting, leaving just one remaining, that of dorothy morris , 76, whose husband, george, remains hospitalized after the shooting. a date has not yet been set, said bill royle, a family friend, because it depends in part on mr. morris's recovery. on this cool, sunny day, it seemed as though this reeling community, despite the tears, had finally begun to slip back into a semblance of its former rhythms, as the horde of news media that descended upon the city finally began to pack up and leave. grocery carts trundled through the aisles at the safeway where the shooting occurred, though shoppers continued to pause and reflect in front of a makeshift memorial outside. the neighborhood where mr. loughner lived with his parents, randy and amy, was quiet on sunday afternoon, with nary a satellite truck in sight. about 300 people gathered at a midtown park on sunday morning and marched about two miles to ms. giffords's district office in what organizers called a \"walk for peace\" to honor the victims of the shooting. the event was the brainchild of amanda lopez, 23, and amanda hutchison, 20, who had been grappling with how respond to the rampage, ultimately coming up with the idea of the peace walk. some marchers carried babies in slings or pushed strollers, others walked their dogs. to avoid politicizing the event, the organizers decided not to allow anyone to hold signs, but distributed yellow ribbons to commemorate the victims. \"it's time for people to reflect, for the city of tucson and the rest of the country to come together and reflect,\" said yvette patterson, 42, who was among the marchers. \"it's important that we really see the humanity in each other. if we don't start to lower our barriers, maybe we could get torn apart.\" when the crowd reached a collection of tributes outside ms. giffords's office, a woman began singing \"amazing grace.\" others in the crowd softly sang along. the effects of the shooting, like pebbles in a pond, continued to ripple on sunday, as one of the 13 people wounded spent the day in a mental health center by police order. the wounded person, j. eric fuller, 63, a military veteran, was arrested on saturday after disrupting a forum being taped for broadcast by abc news. he was said to have blurted out \"you're dead\" to trent humphries, the founder of the tucson tea party, who was speaking. mr. fuller had showed flashes of anger, railing against the \"tea party crime syndicate\" in an interview with the new york times in the early days after the shooting. he was being held for a 72-hour mental health evaluation, said jason ogan, a spokesman for the pima county sheriff's office. the sheriff's office forwarded charges of threats, intimidation and disorderly conduct against mr. fuller to the county attorney's office, mr. ogan said. at mr. zimmerman's service, mr. kelly, an astronaut who is supposed to lead the crew of the shuttle endeavour this spring on its final mission, spoke for several minutes. he was one of a long train of speakers that included childhood friends, relatives and staff members in ms. giffords's office. as ms. giffords's director of community outreach, mr. zimmerman helped prepare for the \"congress on your corner\" event at the safeway on jan. 8. he arrived early, as he often did. when ms. giffords was shot, mr. zimmerman, 30, was standing nearby and lunged to help her. he was remembered on sunday as a passionate idealist, able to put anyone at ease, dedicating his life to helping others. he proposed to his girlfriend last summer while on a 5 a.m. run through the mountains. he was addicted to diet sodas. he was so good with angry callers that his nickname in the office was \"the constituent whisperer.\" ron barber, another of ms. giffords's aides who was shot in the attack, took the stage with the help of a walker. he said mr. zimmerman was a genius at connecting with people from across the political and social spectrums. \"he had the integrity, he had the heart, he had the personality,\" mr. barber said. the story of mr. stoddard, mourned at the day's other funeral, has become part of the tragedy's lore. when the gunfire erupted, mr. stoddard knocked down his wife, mavy, and threw his body on top of hers to protect her. mrs. stoddard was shot three times in the leg but was released from the hospital last week. as the service was about to end, mrs. stoddard went to the microphone, wearing a red jacket and sitting in a wheelchair. her hands shaking but her voice strong and firm, she said: \"i am the woman who was married to this man. he loved god, and he loved me, and spoiled me rotten.\" a wave of laughter went through the audience. \"the journey will be very, very difficult, but he died for me, and i must live for him,\" she said. \"i will survive,\" she added. \"we will not let that gunman take that away.\"",

        "title": "brazil gains in reaching out to africa.",
        "abstract": "rio de janeiro in mozambique, brazil 's government is opening a plant making antiretroviral drugs to fight the aids epidemic. brazil is lending $150 million to kenya to build roads and ease congestion in the capital, nairobi. and in angola, a rising oil power, a new security agreement seeks to expand the training of angolan military personnel in brazil. brazil, which has more people of african descent than any other country outside of africa itself, is assertively raising its profile again on the continent, building on historical ties from the time of the portuguese empire. the array of aid projects and loans recently extended to african countries points both to brazil's ambitions of projecting greater influence in the developing world and to the expanding business allure of africa, where some economies are rapidly growing even as parts of the continent still grapple with wars and famine . the charm offensive is paying off in surging trade flows between brazil and africa, growing to $27.6 billion in 2011 from $4.3 billion in 2002. \"there's the growing sense that africa is brazil's frontier,\" said jerry davila, a historian at the university of illinois who has written extensively about brazil's inroads across the south atlantic ocean. \"brazil is in the privileged position of finally reaching the institutional capacity to do this.\" brazil's forays into africa are similar to the ambitions of other rising powers, like turkey, which has established its sway in the arab world, and india's promotion of its culture across asia . the prominence given to africa also reflects brazil's shift from aid recipient to provider. big development challenges persist in brazil, including woeful public schools and a sharp economic slowdown this year. but brazil is a major agricultural exporter that recently surpassed britain as the world's sixth-largest economy, and it now boasts more embassies in africa than britain does a notable change from when brazil relied on foreign aid in the 1960s, largely from the united states, to alleviate hunger in the country's impoverished northeast. africa now accounts for about 55 percent of the disbursements by the brazilian cooperation agency, which oversees aid projects abroad, according to marco farani, the agency's director. altogether, including educational exchanges and an expanding loan portfolio, brazil's foreign aid exceeds $1 billion, he said. big portions of brazilian aid also go to countries in latin america, and there is a smaller focus on east timor, the former portuguese colony in southeast asia. \"we still have a smaller foreign aid profile than other some countries, but we're learning how to do cooperation,\" mr. farani said. brazil still trails other nations, notably china and the united states, which have far more expansive aid programs and trade in africa. elsewhere in latin america, venezuela and cuba have offered different ways of enhancing african ties. venezuela organized a 2009 summit meeting of african and south american leaders, in which president hugo chavez tightened an alliance with libya's leader at the time, col. muammar el-qaddafi. during the cold war, cuban troops supported communist governments in africa. in angola, this mission included the seemingly paradoxical task of protecting a chevron oil complex at the same time the united states was supporting an insurgency against angola's leaders. more recently, cuba has sent thousands of doctors to africa. but while the cuban and venezuelan efforts have largely prioritized developing-world solidarity with some african nations, brazil's growing foothold in africa is more complex, involving ambitions to forge brazil into a diplomatic and economic powerhouse. after a surge of openings of diplomatic missions over the past decade, brazil now has 36 embassies across africa, and hopes to open its 37th in malawi this year. brazil is already using this presence to bolster its actions on the world stage, sending jets to fly delegations from sierra leone, liberia and cape verde to the united nations conference on sustainable development, which was held here in june. other projects are intended to lure africans to study in brazil. a new university began offering classes last year for students from portuguese-speaking countries, including angola, guinea-bissau, mozambique, and sao tome and principe. since brazil does not need to import large amounts of oil or food, its plans in africa differ somewhat from other countries seeking greater influence there. outreach projects tie largely into efforts to increase opportunities for brazilian companies, which sometimes work with brazil's government in offering aid. some of brazil's biggest inroads, predictably, are in portuguese-speaking countries like angola, where the brazilian construction company odebrecht ranks among the largest employers, and mozambique, where the mining giant vale has begun a $6 billion coal expansion project. but brazilian companies are also scouring other parts of africa for opportunities, putting down stakes in guinea and nigeria. a leading brazilian investment bank, btg pactual, started a $1 billion fund in may focused on investing in africa. new links are also emerging, including brazilian farming ventures in sudan; a flight from addis ababa, ethiopia's capital, to sao paulo; and a fiber optic cable connecting northeast brazil to west africa. some of brazil's forays in africa have come with complications, including criticism of warming ties with leaders connected to human rights abuses, like equatorial guinea's president, teodoro obiang nguema mbasogo. a freedom-of-information measure has enabled journalists to delve into african arms deals by brazilian companies, including the sale of cluster bombs to zimbabwe. african students studying in brazil have filed numerous complaints describing slurs and aggression, complicating the myth of \"racial democracy\" that once prevailed here, in which scholars contended that brazil had largely escaped the discrimination common in other societies. in one episode here in rio, eleuterio nhantumbo, a mozambican police officer with a scholarship to study public security at a brazilian university, said he was stopped by police officers on one occasion. they ordered him to raise his shirt upon exiting a store on the suspicion that he had stolen something. when he questioned why they had singled him out, he said the officers responded with a racial slur and warned him of addressing them without respect; hearing his accent in portuguese, they queried him about his origins. \"the police asked, 'where's mozambique?' \" said mr. nhantumbo, 33. \"they didn't know that there existed a country with this name.\" brazil, closely linked for centuries to africa through shipping routes and the slave trade, is thought to have imported 10 times as many slaves as the united states did before slavery was abolished here in 1888. for a stretch in the 19th century, brazil was the seat of the portuguese empire, making the capital then, rio de janeiro, a nerve center for trade with africa. those ties withered until civilian leaders sought to establish relations with newly independent governments in africa in the early 1960s. that process cooled after brazil's military rulers seized power in a 1964 coup supported by the united states. then economic necessity and a quest to build autonomy from the united states laid the foundations in the 1970s for today's diplomatic buildup in africa. seeking to offset spending on oil imports, including cargoes from nigeria, military rulers set about opening new markets in africa for brazilian companies. they found some success, notably in newly independent angola. brazil's former president, luiz inacio lula da silva, built on those inroads in trips to africa from 2003 to 2010, referring to the \" historic debt \" brazil had to africa in its formation as nation.",

        "title": "recession drives women back to the work force.",
        "abstract": "the great recession is pushing many highly educated women who had left work to stay at home with their children to dive back into the labor pool, according to several nationally recognized experts on women in the workplace. many of these women are sending out job applications for the first time in years because their husbands were laid off, fear being laid off or had their salaries cut or because their family's investments plunged in value. last february trudi foutts loh felt compelled to find full-time work, some 20 years after she quit her job to care for her two children. her job back then as a lawyer and three hours of daily commuting made balancing everything impossible. she occasionally worked as a political consultant and writer, but numerous economic worries made her conclude that that was not enough. she pointed to investment losses \"in the healthy six figures,\" along with \"some very high medical expenses for a family member and having two daughters in college. and then the value of our home and pension plan has taken a tumble.\" she feels lucky because a law school friend hired her at a prestigious firm in pasadena , calif. for lisa hughes, a mother of two, it was an unexpected layoff that shoved her back into the labor pool. a former corporate lawyer, she moved from montclair, n.j., to california last year, after the world poker tour recruited her husband to be its chief operating officer. then, squeezed by the recession, the tour laid him off, pushing ms. hughes to pursue full-time work for the first time in 16 years. \"never in my wildest dreams did i imagine he would be unemployed a year later,\" she said. she plans to start a solo practice because \"it's hard to find jobs after 16 years.\" according to some economists, these women, once part of a privileged minority that could afford not to work, are now collateral damage of the recession not forced out of work, but back into it. \"what's happened is 78 percent of the people who lost their jobs in the recession are men,\" said joan williams, director of the center for worklife law at the university of california hastings college of law in san francisco . \"that has brought home to many families that having one income places you in a very vulnerable position. some women who expected to take a long time out of the work force suddenly felt they needed to re-enter, in some cases much more quickly than they expected.\" the federal bureau of labor statistics found preliminary evidence of affluent women returning to the labor force. when it comes to women with a college education who are 25 to 44 years old and living with a spouse, the proportion of those working or looking for work increased to 78.4 percent in the first half of 2009, from 76 percent in the first half of 2007. economists say this is surprising because the percentage of people in the work force usually drops as unemployed workers grow discouraged and stop looking for work in a recession. over the same period, the proportion of men of the same age and circumstance inched down, falling from 97.4 percent to 97.1 percent. it is too early to tell whether those numbers reflect an increase above and beyond the long-term growth of women's participation in the work force. examining women's work force participation and especially women with children has been one of the battlefields of economics. in the last several years, some researchers have suggested that many affluent working mothers chose to leave the work force during the boom times of the 90's and early this decade, saying there was a trend of women opting out of careers once they had children. the suggestion highlighted in an oct. 26, 2003 new york times magazine cover article prompted a huge controversy. critics responded that most women had no choice but to work and that only a small affluent minority could chose not to. they said many working mothers left the labor force not because they were opting to, but because they were forced to by workplaces that made it too difficult to balance family and work. separately, some economists argued that the decrease in women working was not caused by opting out, but by the 2001 recession that was followed by years of weak job growth. heather boushey, a senior economist at the liberal center for american progress and a fierce critic of the notion of opting out, said her studies showed little difference in how often mothers and women without children left the labor force. ms. boushey nonetheless agreed that the current recession was pushing women who had stopped working for whatever reason to re-enter the labor force. she said this helped explain why the percentage of women aged 20 and above in the work force has remained relatively flat during the recession, while the percentage of men has fallen slightly. \"this does indicate that some women are opting back in,\" she said. one of them is patricia smart. she quit her banking job 14 years ago when her son was born. but last april, her husband received a layoff notice. \"it was a cosmic kick in the butt,\" said ms. smart, who had toyed with returning to work for years. \"it forced me to do something.\" after a quick job search, she landed a job in july as a full-time manager at wachovia bank in charlotte , n.c. carolyn bednarz was not as fortunate. the former lawyer at milbank & tweed spent nine years at home raising three children, but she became frightened for her family's future after her banker-husband endured four rounds of layoffs and reduced bonuses. ms. bednarz started looking for work. after a 10-month search she couldn't find a paying job. \"i probably applied for 30 jobs on craigslist , and hardly anyone writes back,\" she said, complaining that many employers aren't interested in hiring someone who has not worked in years. \"this is just the most humbling experience.\" in the end, she took a position as an unpaid intern at a law firm in marin county, calif., north of san francisco. several studies have found that two different groups of women are likely not to return to work after giving birth: affluent ones and poor ones unable to afford child care. sylvia ann hewlett, founder of the center for work-life policy in new york, an independent research group, and several other economists and experts argue that there is an unmistakable trend toward women returning to the labor force and not just professional women. \"women are at a watershed moment,\" ms. hewlett said, pointing to the recession's squeeze on incomes. anna bresnahan of spokane , wash., says she would not have returned to work if she and her husband had not started worrying that the bank where he worked might fail. \"i decided i could start looking. he said, 'that would be nice.' \" ms. bresnahan, who quit a marketing job in 2001 after her first child was born, found a position with an accounting firm in december, although at a lower salary. (studies have found that for every two years a woman is out of the labor force, her earnings fall by 10 percent, a penalty that lasts throughout her career.) karen boon felt pressured to return to working full time after staying home for five years to raise her two children. her husband's job for boston scientific , a manufacturer of medical devices, was shaky and the family's investments had plunged. ms. boon regularly visits the opting back in chat room, sponsored by the hastings college of law, where lawyers with new jobs trade stories, tips, hopes and complaints. \"if my husband had been laid off, it would have been a world of hurt,\" she said. in april, she found a temporary job as counsel for a bay area company that oversees surgery centers, replacing someone on maternity leave. she said it was a pleasure to be working with adults again. still, she added, \"it is really hard to do two jobs at once the kids still need to be fed and the laundry still needs to get done.\" ms. bednarz, the former milbank lawyer turned intern, also participates in the chat room. \"the women who lead the chat room say, 'don't jump into something until you find something that's just right,' \" she said. \"that's all well and fine, but some of us have to find something right now. it's not like we have that luxury in today's job market.\"",

        "abstract": "washington president obama will not veto a military authorization bill that contains several disputed provisions about the treatment of terrorism prisoners, the white house announced wednesday, signaling a likely end to a political battle over detainees and executive power. the administration had threatened to veto versions of the national defense authorization act of 2012 passed by the house and the senate, arguing that provisions would open the door for the military to perform policing functions inside the united states, and that they would infringe on executive branch powers. but the white house said in a statement that adjustments made by a house-senate conference committee had sufficiently addressed its concerns. \"as a result of these changes, we have concluded that the language does not challenge or constrain the president's ability to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the american people, and the president's senior advisors will not recommend a veto,\" it said. civil liberties groups still object to the revised bill. but other critics of earlier versions notably, representative adam smith of washington state, the ranking democrat on the house armed services committee praised the changes and urged that the bill be passed. on wednesday, the house approved the bill, 283 to 136; it goes to the senate. the administration and congress have been wrestling for months over proposed rules and limits for handling terrorism cases. the bill that emerged from the conference committee on tuesday dropped a section from the house version that would have banned using civilian courts to prosecute qaeda suspects. it also dropped a house-written provision enacting a new authorization to use military force against al qaeda and its allies. but the bill includes a narrower provision, drafted by the senate, authorizing the government to detain, without trial, suspected members of al qaeda or its allies or those who \" substantially supported \" them bolstering the authorization it enacted a decade ago against the perpetrators of the sept. 11 attacks. another section would require officials to hold noncitizens suspected of being qaeda operatives in military custody. the administration had focused its objections on that section, but the panel expanded the executive branch's ability to make exceptions. it also added language declaring that the new law would not restrict the existing authority of the federal bureau of investigation in terrorism matters. still, the bureau's director, robert s. mueller iii, testified on wednesday that he remained concerned that it would introduce \"uncertainty\" about what should happen at the time of an arrest. another provision would require the attorney general to consult with military and intelligence agencies before charging a terrorism suspect in civilian court. the bill also would require the defense secretary to certify, before transferring any qaeda-related detainee to another country, that it has met certain security conditions expanding a rule that currently applies only to prisoners at guantanamo bay, cuba. but the bill would also relax the certification requirements, which the pentagon has said are too onerous to meet.",

        "title": "on the web with big concepts for a fragmented long island.",
        "abstract": "oyster bay, n.y. those whose first thoughts about long island usually don't begin with high-concept, big-think, high-tech regional planning analysis might be surprised by some of the vapors emanating from there these days. there's the long island plasma converter project, the long island innovation council and the long island 3.0 open code library, which is not to be confused with the long island internet public library or the long island info grid. there's the long island idea bank, the long island school of meta interdisciplinary studies, the one long island virtual constitution and {hellip}well, you get the idea. there's a lot more. of course, to be technical, none of it actually exists outside the brain and web site of louis g. savinetti, an unpretentious long island native with gray hair and glasses, and family roots in sea cliff, locust valley, glen head and glen cove, who is a former member of the oyster bay town council and now serves as the town's human resources commissioner. but sitting at taby's burger house, with its antique map of the long island that was \"large estates here,\" \"good swordfishing here\" you quickly realize that there's much to be learned about mr. savinetti, about long island, and about the political potential of the wired world in his somewhat quixotic long island idea factory web site, longislandideafactory.blogspot.com . mr. savinetti, 52, came out of c. w. post college thinking he wanted to teach and compose music, but soon ditched that and later got degrees in public administration and law. along the way, he picked up the habit of scribbling down ideas in notebooks, which piled up in the basement of his house. about a year ago, he decided to do something with them online as an abstract intellectual exercise \"sort of the way other people do crossword puzzles\" and as something with public policy potential. and so, in march the long island idea factory was introduced as a way to throw ideas out into the public sphere and to offer online avenues for people and institutions to share information, data and ideas about long island, a place sorely lacking in unifying structures. its catchphrase is \"one long island,\" and it reads like half eccentric fantasy baseball for tech-savvy policy wonks and half serious virtual forum for tech-savvy policy wonks. asked to sum up on his blog what it's about, he wrote: \"simply stated, 'one long island' is a series of interrelated projects designed to foster productive collaboration on long island through the utilization of common technology, interdisciplinary education, public participation and a shared long island philosophy. in short it is a way to change the way we solve problems on long island in a sustainable manner.\" he figured he needed a reality check before he went too far. \"i'm out there writing this stuff, and maybe i'm insane. you don't know,\" he said. so he sent it off to some serious people, who took it seriously. john murcott, a successful long island software entrepreneur, whose current project, 411karma.com , is a social networking site for the nonprofit world, and yacov shamash, dean of the college of engineering and applied sciences at stony brook university, both said the site filled a void and reflected a logical intersection of technology and public policy. dr. shamash, in fact, is meeting with mr. savinetti to forge a partnership with stony brook that would build a long island virtual think tank with more technological sophistication than mr. savinetti's homemade one. \"there are great ideas here, but the question is, what kind of controls are you going to put on, and what kind of structure and organization do you put up around it?\" dr. shamash said. with its label clouds and meta-charts and other buzzy features, mr. savinetti's site might not be for everyone. he's quick to say the site doesn't reinvent the wheel and instead uses many ideas from other sources. but he likes to think that in its own way it still gets at something intrinsic to long island, with its hundreds of towns, villages, special districts, school districts and very little that ties them all together. \"when i was growing up, long island was open space, a clean environment, small communities,\" he said. \"now it has an identity issue. what do you think of when you see long island in the news? i don't know. joey buttafuoco. the hamptons. now maybe illegal immigrants, the license issue. \"it doesn't seem like long island is something or a series of somethings that add up to one thing. i guess that's why no one ever used one long island before.\" and, whether or not the site creates a useful virtual long island, he figures maybe it will help him at home in the real one. \"i thought it would be nice for my son to see i wasn't a complete idiot and that i had an idea every once in a while,\" he said. \"you know how kids are.\"",

        "title": "now, even those temporary wheels can be greener.",
        "abstract": "roo rogers, who lives in lower manhattan, is helping to reduce auto emissions by not owning a car. but he still likes to take the wheel for occasional multistop spins around town, for hundred-mile drives to a vacation home on long island and for business trips when he's in california. when he rents a car or uses a car-sharing service, mr. rogers tries to help the environment a little more by driving only a hybrid vehicle, the toyota prius . and he has ridden to the airport by using ozocar, a car service of which he was a founder; it has an all-hybrid fleet of priuses and a few lexuses. \"the prius is the most practical and sustainable car with the best gas mileage,\" he said. \"and i don't have the problems of parking, the insurance and even the gas whenever i go anywhere.\" in city driving, the prius gets 60 miles for each gallon of gas a dozen more than its main competitor, the honda civic hybrid, and double the urban range of the highest-mileage gasoline-only cars, according to the environmental protection agency. as more consumers express concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, and as gasoline prices rise, rental car companies are reshaping their fleets. in june, enterprise, hertz and avis, the largest renters, added several thousand priuses to their fleets, as well as other hybrids, and more are on the way. car service companies are another source of priuses. evo limo, based in los angeles, began adding the cars to its fleet two years ago the same year when mr. rogers started ozocar. to be sure, rental hybrids are not necessarily bargains, nor are they always available. the biggest range of services and the greatest number of hybrids can generally be found in west coast cities including portland, seattle, san francisco and los angeles, and northeastern cities like boston, new york and washington. some cities offer more choices than others at least for now. in the los angeles area, for example, hertz branches and ev rental cars, a smaller company with an all-hybrid fleet, have had priuses readily available for years. when chloe ellers of los angeles had to take her audi in for repairs, she got a prius as a replacement vehicle from midway car rental, without even asking for one. avis has joined the competition in los angeles and several other west coast cities. \"it's all about demand,\" said john barrows, a spokesman for avis. in the east, change is coming more slowly. hertz has only recently moved into new york with its hybrids, and avis plans to follow by year-end. to make online reservations for a prius from hertz, renters need to click onto the \"green collection\" category under vehicle type. for a recent midweek reservation, the prius cost $127 a day in manhattan (not including any insurance). that was $7 more than for a regular gas-powered toyota corolla . enterprise rent-a-car has hybrids across the nation, and among the lowest rates. priuses account for half of the company's more than 3,000 hybrids, said pat farrell, a company spokesman. other hybrids in its fleet include saturn vues from general motors, ford escapes and toyota camrys. its midweek daily rate was $56 in manhattan for the category that includes the prius. but customers may not necessarily get the hybrid because enterprise doesn't rent specific models, only vehicle types, and the prius is just one of a number standard sedans. torshana towles tried to rent a prius from enterprise in silver spring, md. asking for one twice in the last few months. she came up empty both times. instead, she got a ford escape , a sport-utility hybrid. \"it was cool, though,\" she said. \"it doesn't get any better mileage than a sedan does, but it does much better than other s.u.v.'s and it's so quiet when it's on the electric motor.\" priuses are easier to get from car services for customers in the two cities they serve. ozocar in new york charges rates of $65 from manhattan to kennedy airport and $50 to laguardia or by the hour. the cars are equipped with laptops, sirius radio and internet service. but it may be the car-sharing services that offer drivers the best way for drivers to reduce their impact on the environment. the two most successful companies, zipcar and flexcar, rent cars by the hour and the day to members only. members pick up cars from various locations in a city and return them to the same spot. gasoline and insurance are included in the rental costs. both zipcar and flexcar have had priuses in their fleets for more than two years and have been adding them as their businesses grow. flexcar, based in seattle, has a 2,000-car fleet, including about 30 percent that are priuses (250 cars) or honda civic hybrids (350). flexcars can be found in 12 cities on the east and west coasts (but not in new york), and in chicago. rates start at $8 an hour and $63 a day. there is a $35 annual membership fee. zipcar, based in boston, has 3,000 cars, including 150 priuses and 20 honda civic hybrids. the hybrids are in new york and 13 other cities, mostly on the east and west coasts. priuses at zipcar rent for $8 an hour and $85 for a weekday in new york, with drivers paying a $50 annual membership fee and a $25 application fee. renting a hybrid is just one way for drivers to reduce their impact on the environment when using a car-sharing service, scott griffith, chief executive of zipcar, said. \"we see that drivers change their behavior when they become members,\" he says. \"they're being charged by the hour, so they tend to group their trips together and so they don't drive as much as they did before. many members who owned cars sell them. of our 100,000 members, some 40,000 have sold their cars or decided not to buy one since joining.\" mark norman, chief executive of flexcar, reports a similar experience at his company. russell caprio is one of the converts. he lives in downtown san francisco, one of the few cities where the two car-sharing companies compete, and owned a subaru until he sold it after becoming a zipcar member earlier this year. he hadn't used his car much, and when he took into account all the costs of owning it insurance, gasoline, depreciation and parking he found that sharing cars would cost hundreds of dollars less. he can also drive a zipcar in boston, where his family lives, rather than rent a car. while he drives other cars, he prefers priuses because he sees them as better for the environment. \"it depends on availability,\" he says. \"i'll walk for one, though. the most i ever had to walk was eight blocks, which was o.k. that's the same distance i had to walk to the garage where i had my subaru parked.\"",

        "abstract": "kabul, afghanistan however matters eventually turn out for the afghan romeo and juliet who eloped into hiding, a happily-ever-after ending is eluding many of those whose lives crossed theirs. the couple, zakia, 18, and mohammad ali, 21, fled their homes in mountainous bamian province after her family threatened her with an \"honor killing\" because she wanted to marry outside her ethnic group, and against her father's wishes. they have stayed in hiding since their escape in march, but an afghan official who helped zakia evade almost certain death has now fled afghanistan and is seeking asylum in rwanda, where she is expected to arrive monday. zakia's family, which included nine other children, many of them young, says it has been driven from its farm, resettling in kabul to eke out an uncertain existence as day laborers. mohammad ali's family is still on its farm in bamian, but his father and brother say they have been forced to mortgage most of their land to raise money to help the couple by bribing officials. in part, his family says, the couple's escape was the only way out because the money to keep paying such bribes had run out, and they feared the courts would return zakia to her family. the couple's story began last year when zakia fled her family's home and asked to be taken in by mohammad ali, declaring her love for him. that was such a contradiction of traditional practices that, although zakia was legally an adult, mohammad ali's father, anwar, took her to a women's shelter in bamian province. image the american philanthropist miriam adelson, wife of the casino magnate sheldon adelson, expressed an interest in helping the couple and anyone involved in their case. credit win mcnamee/getty images zakia said her family, members of the tajik ethnic group and sunni muslims, opposed the match because mohammad ali is a hazara and shiite. the matter went to court, where judges ordered zakia returned to her family, despite her age and her wishes. instead, the head of the women's affairs ministry office in bamian, fatima kazimi, intervened to keep her protected in a shelter, suspecting zakia's family would kill her when they got her home. her brothers and father have vowed in front of witnesses to kill zakia and mohammad ali, and her own mother has denounced her as a whore. but then on march 20, zakia climbed the wall of the women's shelter in the middle of the night and eloped with mohammad ali, and they have remained in hiding since. ms. kazimi said that she was blamed for engineering their escape, and that zakia's family threatened her life as a result. she made it known that she wanted to flee the country, as did zakia and mohammad ali. the american philanthropist miriam adelson, wife of the casino magnate sheldon adelson, expressed an interest in helping the couple and anyone involved in their case, and she persuaded the president of rwanda, paul kagame, to offer them asylum. because ms. kazimi had a passport, that was fairly easy to arrange once she got to india, where there were rwandan consular services. ms. kazimi confirmed, in an interview a week ago, that she planned to go to rwanda with her husband and children. the minister of women's affairs, however, was critical of ms. kazimi's motives. \"her life is not in danger,\" said the minister, husn banu ghazanfar. \"our life is in danger because of her. bamian is one of the safest places in the country; she's just trying to make a deal for herself.\" video zakia and mohammad ali fled threats of arrest and death in afghanistan as a result of their marriage, which crosses cultural boundaries. credit credit diego ibarra sanchez for the new york times it was more difficult, however, for ms. adelson's contacts to make arrangements for the couple, since they had no passports. western embassies have been reluctant to get involved because of criminal charges of bigamy brought against them by zakia's family, who claimed she had been married previously. many others have been affected by their escape, as well. najeeba ahmadi, who is the head of the shelter that zakia escaped from, said she had been blamed. \"this is a shelter, not a prison, but they blame me from both sides, the government and the family. the family says, 'we want our daughter back, dead or alive.' \" meanwhile, zakia's family fled bamian because of the anger among hazara neighbors who sympathized with the couple. \"we left everything, whatever we had in our home, our fields, everything,\" said gula khan, 21, her brother. \"if we were men, we would do something,\" and \"take our revenge.\" mohammad ali's relatives say they have been financially ruined by the elopement. his father, anwar, has mortgaged most of his 28 acres to pay what he said amounted to $22,000 in bribes during the nearly six months that zakia was in the shelter while the courts tried to compel officials to turn her over to her family. anwar said he paid bribes to government officials on many levels to prevent that from happening. (like most of his and zakia's family, he goes by one name.) \"there was no way but to give our lands, all of our best fields,\" said anwar's son bismullah. \"my father has high blood pressure, but we don't even have money to take him to the clinic.\" mohammad ali was reached by cellphone in hiding at an undisclosed location. instead of a ring, his phone plays one of the love songs of ahmad zahir, considered the elvis presley of afghanistan, a crooner who sang rock songs based on persian ballads, and was killed by the communists in 1979. \"i know it's extremely hard for my family,\" he said. \"i feel bad for this; i didn't know how much my father had to give. you spend your life in hope, and i'm just hoping now that god will help us.\" he passed the phone to zakia, who seemed unmoved by word of her family's new situation. \"god be with them, but why should i miss them? i know it's my family, but they only want to do me harm.\"",

'true sovereignty for russia is absolutely necessary for survival' - dec. 4, 2014 video president vladimir v. putin of russia vowed that the country would stay on course with its values, independent foreign policy and economic goals, even as it faced sanctions from the west. credit credit alexander astafyev/ria novosti, via associated press in his state of the nation speech, mr. putin used the same aggrieved, angry tone he has often adopted in his public pronouncements since the ukrainian crisis erupted in march. the west reacted to the annexation of crimea and the conflict in ukraine by imposing sanctions, but mr. putin said those events were just a pretext. \"this is not just a nervous reaction of the united states and its allies to our position with regards to events and the coup in ukraine,\" he said in his 70-minute speech. \"if all that had not happened, they would have come up with a different mode to restrain russia,\" mr. putin said , accusing the west of pursuing the same policy for \"decades if not centuries.\" 'if europe does not want this to be realized, then it will not be realized' - dec. 1 image president vladimir v. putin of russia, left, and his turkish counterpart, recep tayyip erdogan, during a news conference monday in the new presidential palace in ankara, turkey. credit turkish presidential press office, via european pressphoto agency even in retreat, mr. putin tries to take the offensive. when a russian project to build a major pipeline to southern europe was blocked by bulgaria, he redirected the project toward turkey and chastised the bulgarians . the initial deal was caught up in the political and diplomatic quarrel over ukraine, as western powers became determined to resist mr. putin's aggressive policies at every turn. \"if europe does not want this to be realized, then it will not be realized,\" he said, calling it \"ridiculous\" to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the pipeline through bulgaria only to have to abandon it. \"but such is the decision of our european friends,\" he said, adding a jab that bulgaria, by giving in to pressure, had been \"deprived of the opportunity to act as a sovereign state.\" 'you can do a lot more with weapons and politeness than just politeness' -

'it is clear the militia has achieved a major success' - aug. 29 in an otherwise mundane statement posted on the kremlin website , mr. putin refers to the \"novorossiya\" or new russia, militia, a pointed reference to rebel fighters in ukraine who represent the broader new russia favored by russian nationalists . \"it is clear the militia has achieved a major success in intercepting kiev's military operation, which represents a grave danger to the population of donbass and which has already led to the loss of many lives among peaceful residents,\" he said. behind the message, analysts saw several kremlin goals: a political order that weakens kiev's control in ukraine, easing of pressure on increasingly beleaguered rebel forces in luhansk and donetsk, and possibly a land route to crimea.

        "abstract": "hong kong nam kee noodles is a typical hong kong restaurant: functional, popular and busy. a dozen plastic-topped tables offer room for about 40 patrons. customers line up outside at lunchtime, waiting to consume spicy noodle soup, dumplings and iced soy milk amid the clatter of plastic bowls and chopsticks. in april, however, the little restaurant, in the heart of causeway bay, one of hong kong's busiest shopping districts, nearly had to shut down after the landlord tripled the already-expensive rent. \"we were paying around 200,000 dollars a month,\" said au kei-hong, the shop's manager, referring to an amount in hong kong dollars equivalent to about $25,800. \"but the landlord then increased it to 600,000. it was too expensive. we cannot afford that.\" after frantic negotiations, mr. au agreed to a smaller though still steep increase that has allowed him to stay put for an additional year. image nam kee noodles, center, was able to stay in business in causeway bay after negotiating a smaller increase in rent. credit lam yik fei for the international herald tribune others have not been so lucky. soaring rents have forced at least three small businesses on the same causeway bay street to move or close in the last few months, and similar tales of woe are common among small businesses in other prime areas in the bustling, crowded city. rapid growth and sweeping economic changes have raised retail rents in many of asia's growing metropolises in recent years. but nowhere have they reached the heights of hong kong, a banking, logistics and trading hub that many companies see as a testing ground and launching pad for the vastly larger mainland chinese market. hong kong's residential property prices have fallen from their recent highs mainly because of government measures intended to cool demand but those measures do not affect retail rents. \"it's a normal phenomenon for small retailers to be squeezed out by high rents. it happens everywhere,\" said joe lin, executive director of retail services at the real estate services firm cbre in hong kong. image au kei-hong, the manager of nam kee noodles, said his landlord had tried to raise the rent to more than $75,000 a month. credit lam yik fei for the international herald tribune \"but in hong kong, the pressures have become very severe in the last two to three years it's very unhealthy. luxury and jewelry now dominate 90 percent of the space in prime locations,\" mr. lin said. \"the whole trade mix in some of these areas has changed.\" causeway bay, where nam kee noodles is struggling to survive among high-end clothing and watch retailers, commands the most expensive retail rents in the world: an average of 1,950 hong kong dollars, or $251, per square foot per month, according to figures for the first quarter of 2013 from cushman & wakefield, a real estate consulting firm. two other hong kong neighborhoods, tsim sha tsui and central, also rank among the five most expensive locations in the world with fifth avenue and times square in new york easily topping luxury shopping destinations like the champs-elysees in paris and the ginza in tokyo. that has squeezed out many of the colorful mom and pop stores hardware shops, fruit stalls, herbal medicine vendors, restaurants that form a large part of hong kong's business ecosystem, changing the face of many neighborhoods in the process. image rapidly rising rents have priced some small retailers out of causeway bay, one of hong kong's busiest shopping districts. credit lam yik fei for the international herald tribune a few minutes' walk from central, which is home to hong kong's financial district, ngau kee food cafe, which for many years sold traditional cantonese dishes to diners perched on rickety stools, closed in april after the landlord raised the monthly rent to 120,000 dollars from 49,000. the restaurant's owner, mak ping-kuen, says he hopes to reopen in another part of town but has struggled to find a site. \"i hope we can reopen as soon as possible. my customers are getting impatient,\" he said. nearby, two popular bars in the soho district have closed in the last few months, again because the owners could not afford big rent increases. and tsui yuen desserts, which sold delicacies like ginger-flavored milk custard and sweet black sesame soup for less than 20 dollars a bowl (about $2.50), had to relocate from causeway bay to wan chai, a neighborhood more geared to night life than to hungry tourists. image ngau kee food cafe, right, in central, closed after the rent rose to 120,000 hong kong dollars, or $15,475, from 49,000. credit lam yik fei for the international herald tribune \"sure, we have some old customers who still come for a bowl of dessert, but it's a lot quieter now,\" said the manager, mr. ho, who would give only his last name. \"we want to go back to causeway bay, but we can't. even a small little shop would cost us 200,000 dollars a month. going back would bankrupt us.\" in the wake of the displaced businesses, luxury goods retailers and jewelry and cosmetics shops have flocked en masse to hong kong in recent years, seeking to cater to a flood of shoppers from neighboring mainland china. the british clothing retailer topshop, for example, opened a large store in central its first in greater china in early june, while apple and the japanese clothing retailer uniqlo opened huge outlets around the corner from nam kee noodles in the last few months. taxes on high-end goods are far lower in hong kong than in mainland china, so those goods in particular are popular with mainland shoppers. at the same time, the number of visitors from the mainland has soared since travel restrictions for them were loosened in 2003 to help hong kong weather the economic blow dealt by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or sars, that year. in 2002, 6.8 million mainlanders visited hong kong. last year, the number was 35 million. image mak ping-kuen, who owns ngau kee food cafe, said he hoped to reopen elsewhere in hong kong but had not found a site. credit lam yik fei for the international herald tribune the money they have spent has helped drive economic growth in hong kong and makes up a sizable part of the economy and the local job market. chinese visitors spent the equivalent of almost $23 billion in hong kong in 2012 equal to about 9 percent of gross domestic product and that figure, said donna kwok, an economist at hsbc in hong kong, is likely to rise to about $60 billion by 2015. hong kong's resulting attractiveness to companies that want to lure those visitors has helped drive up retail and office rents. shop rents in causeway bay, for example, have risen about 80 percent since mid-2010 and have more than doubled since 2007, according to cushman & wakefield. moreover, analysts say, no relief is in sight, although the mainland chinese economy is cooling. \"china's economy may be slowing, but this does not mean that demand is going to evaporate,\" ms. kwok said. \"chinese shoppers will keep coming to hong kong.\" and as long as they do, mr. lin of cbre said, retailers will want to increase their presence in the city, ensuring that shop rents will stay high. mr. ho of tsui yuen desserts said: \"ten or 20 percent increases over the years were reasonable. but a 100 percent increase we can't pay that. how many bowls would we have to sell just to cover the rent?\"",

        "title": "indonesia plane crash witnesses heard rumbling, then 'boom'.",
        "abstract": "medan, indonesia for the past decade, rudina simbiring has run a small wooden vegetable stand in a working-class neighborhood in this sprawling metropolis, and she is used to seeing many other local shopkeepers and residents drop by each day to buy her lettuce and tomatoes. on tuesday, however, ms. simbiring, a 60-year-old grandmother, witnessed something she had never seen before and probably will never forget. as she was sitting on a stool behind the counter around 12:15 p.m., she heard a loud rumbling. looking up, she saw a giant gray airplane descending toward the low-rise neighborhood in the south of the city, with at least two of its four propellers not turning and thick black smoke billowing from its wing area. seconds later, she heard a giant crash about 300 feet to her right, and immediately went running for cover into a pharmacy behind her stand. when she and her neighbors had gathered enough courage to venture out a few minutes later, they looked down the street to see the flaming wreckage of an indonesian military aircraft that had slammed into a row of shop houses inside a gated compound where many traditional indonesian massage parlors operate. the crash killed all 122 people aboard and possibly dozens more on the ground, according to the indonesian authorities. the passengers included the 12-member air force crew as well as military personnel and their civilian families on their way to new postings or back to their bases. the military's chief spokesman, maj. gen. fuad basya, said on wednesday that the aircraft, a hercules c-130 transport plane purchased in 1964 from the united states, frequently ferried military personnel and their families around the country. he said it had begun its journey on monday on java island and was scheduled to fly to military bases in the riau islands and indonesian borneo when it went down. at least 21 people on the ground were feared dead in the crash, which rattled the residents of the djamin ginting district of medan, a city of two million on the island of sumatra. \"it was flying very low, and its wings kept tilting from the left to the right just before it crashed,\" ms. simbiring said. \"i was afraid and ran.\" across the street, jon pery, a local entrepreneur, was sitting on the porch of his small house when he felt a huge shudder reverberating all around him. \"it sounded like the sound of a motorcycle starting 'dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum' and then 'boom!' \" he said. mr. pery grabbed his cellphone, ran into the street and took some of the first video footage of the burning wreckage. the aircraft also destroyed several shop houses in the compound, including some that were under construction. voices on mr. pery's 25-second video were heard screaming to onlookers: \"don't go near it! get back, it's dangerous!\" image indonesian soldiers on wednesday near the wreckage of the military transport plane. the crash killed all 122 people aboard and possibly dozens more on the ground. credit antara foto/reuters on wednesday, rescue teams continued to scour the rubble of the crash site looking for bodies, as well as body parts, as hundreds of curious local residents watched from behind police barricades or crime-scene tape. crews using excavators hoisted one of the aircraft's engines onto a flatbed truck and took it away for examination by military investigators. sairi saragih, a spokeswoman for adam malik general hospital in medan, where bodies were being brought for identification, said that 68 victims had been identified as of wednesday afternoon. she said it was possible that the total number of victims on the ground could be lowered if forensic teams determined that some recovered body parts belonged to the same person. at a crisis center set up at the hospital, roliana hasugian was anxiously awaiting word of her missing 21-year-old nephew, hary tongam padang, a university student and part-time masseur at one of the massage parlors in the compound. \"it's very sad i'm afraid he's already dead,\" said ms. hasugian, who as her nephew's only immediate family in medan gave a hair sample to a medical forensics team. the indonesian air force has had five other plane crashes over the past 10 years, with 155 people killed, according to the aviation safety network website . the deadliest before tuesday was the 2009 crash of a c-130 near the city of madiun in east java, which killed 97 passengers and crew members and two people on the ground. that plane hit several houses on its approach to the runway. in addition, there have been several military helicopter accidents, including a crash near the malaysian border in november 2013 that killed 13 people. while crash investigators had not publicly drawn any conclusion by wednesday, witness accounts suggested that the aircraft had suffered mechanical problems. after the crash, local news media quoted members of parliament as saying that the accident showed that indonesia's military hardware was outdated and calling for new spending to upgrade and replace existing equipment. despite having a population of 250 million and being a member of the group of 20, indonesia has a defense budget smaller than that of neighboring singapore, which has five million people, even after indonesia has more than quadrupled its annual military spending to more than $8 billion since 2004. juwono sudarsono, a former indonesian defense minister, said he suspected that the c-130 might have been carrying too many passengers, in particular military dependents \"wanting to hitch cheap rides on flights across four or five different stops over four different bases.\" \"the hercules is one of the safest military aircraft,\" he said. \"my guess is it was very overloaded.\" yohanes sulaiman, a lecturer at the indonesian defense university, said it was too early to speculate that the cause of the crash was anything other than a mechanical problem. \"before we have all the evidence on the table, i think that's the answer,\" he said. at the crisis center, ms. hasugian declined to venture an opinion, saying she hoped only that the forensic teams would positively identify the remains of her missing nephew. \"they said maybe today, maybe tomorrow. we just don't know,\" she said.",

        "title": "tests, near and far, for sebastian coe, track's new chief.",
        "abstract": "beijing for a sport in crisis, the world track and field championships that ended in beijing on sunday provided some unexpected relief. that relief may prove as temporary as last week's blue skies over beijing a result of restrictions on commuting and industry that were put in place by the chinese authorities in advance of the coming major military parade. but track and field and its leadership will take fair weather wherever they can find it in these days of doping doom, and with the ever-longer shadow cast by soccer, the planet's no. 1 sport. over the past half-century, track and field has gone from mainstream to niche in countries like the united states and has lost momentum in strongholds like europe. reversing such trends is as tough a task as outkicking the distance runner mo farah on a bell lap, but the nine days in beijing were a reminder of the entertainment value that track and field still can provide. there were great races galore, among them the men's 100 meters, where usain bolt beat justin gatlin by just one-hundredth of a second, and both 4x400 relays, where the jamaican women and american men prevailed after final-leg lead changes. there were overwhelming victories: ashton eaton's latest world record in the decathlon. there were triumphs of the human spirit: aries merritt's bronze medal in the men's 110 hurdles just four days before he was to receive a kidney transplant. there was also some levity provided by the chinese driver of the segway who crashed bolt's victory celebration after the 200 meters, veering out of control and clipping the track star from behind. it could have been disastrous had bolt come up lame. instead, it was slapstick, not to mention irresistible content for the new media that the sport's recently crowned leader, sebastian coe, is so eager to leverage. image coe, center, with the british runners david heath and sarah louise read cayton, faces persistent questions on doping in the sport. credit damir sagolj/reuters but the cameraman's gaffe was the exception to the rule for the organizers, who put on a smooth-running show in their underused showplace, the bird's nest stadium, which will take its next star turn as the site of the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2022 winter olympics. the last two world championships, in daegu, south korea, in 2011 and in moscow in 2013, suffered from mediocre attendance. beijing had buzz and impressive crowds from the start: 34,000 on average in day sessions and 43,000 in the evening. liu xiang, the olympic 110 hurdles champion in 2004 who is now retired, became a celebrity in china, in part because he succeeded in an event traditionally dominated by western nations. there was similar frisson here when the chinese sprinter su bingtian became the first asian to qualify for the men's 100 final; the excitement was reinforced when su and his teammates ended up with a silver medal in the 4x100 relay. several of the young chinese athletes, including the silver medalist high jumper zhang guowei, have big personalities and no qualms about communicating their emotions to the crowd. for all of track and field's obstacles in its traditional markets, generating greater interest in china, the world's most populous nation, could make up for a lot of ills. coe, a briton who was once the world's best middle-distance runner, took over as president of the international association of athletics federations on monday. change at the top was overdue: lamine diack, the outgoing president, is 82. \"it was getting stagnant,\" said christian taylor, the american triple jumper who won gold in beijing. coe is 58, and as a former top athlete he has deep connections throughout the sport. a gifted speaker, coe should also be able to communicate more widely and effectively than the french-speaking diack, who struggled with english and, in his final news conference, with clarity, too, as he rambled on about the eternal elephant in track and field's room: doping. diack's final point was essentially that track and field has been a pioneer in antidoping efforts, not a laggard. there is truth in this, but the scandals and suspicions keep coming. coe, who once pushed for life bans for major doping violations, understands the landscape better than most. even his own breakthrough performances in the 1970s forced him to answer some questions. \"a kid comes out of a municipal environment in sheffield and suddenly runs 1:42.4 and it's the overnight wonder,\" coe said. \"they tend to forget, of course, that the overnight wonder is the creation of thousands of miles on moorland and tons of steel in the gym.\" coe added: \"what we need to get across is there has to be some proportionality in this. our sport is not a monologue of blood and urine. it is jesse owens and emil zatopek and fanny blankers-koen.\" coe has already talked about outsourcing some testing to an entity independent of the i.a.a.f. in an interview in beijing, coe said that he intended to start a new committee focused on values and on reaching athletes at an early stage in their careers to educate them about the sport's history and better prepare them to combat ethical conflicts. \"i would love to know what was going on in the lives and influences of some of our athletes from the age of 17 or 18 onwards,\" coe said. on the topic of his own potential ethical conflicts, coe rejected the notion that he should be obliged to abandon his role as a paid consultant to nike or his executive chairman's role with the sport and entertainment marketing agency csm. the i.a.a.f. presidency is an unpaid post. coe thinks it should remain so, but said he wanted to maintain his outside income and above all was convinced that he could manage his multiple roles with great transparency and strict adherence to corporate governance rules. \"i did not take this on to make money,\" coe said of the i.a.a.f. presidency. \"or to advance my outside interests. these will be ferociously policed. believe me.\" but even with effective policing, minding the gap between perception and reality could still prove a problem. \"he is definitely the man for the job,\" said mary wittenberg, the former chief of the new york city marathon. \"it's really important that he seizes the moment to lead, to step above all potential conflict. ditch the nike and any other consulting arrangements.\" at a moment of such clear importance for his sport, the last thing coe and track and field need is for his own message to get clouded.",

        "title": "a craft rejuvenated, with added emphasis on art.",
        "abstract": "unlike the bold, colorful hand-lettered signs he makes for restaurants, bars and other businesses, damon styer, the owner of new bohemia signs , is an understated guy. a 1993 graduate of san francisco art institute who began sign painting \"on a whim\" after a failed marriage and a stint at the san francisco stock exchange, mr. styer emphasizes old-school values sure-handedness and practice and plays down the business's artistic side. but low key or not, mr. steyer's creative cache is definitely on the rise. five young painters, many of whom flash tattoos and share mr. styer's art school training, churn out hand-painted signs and gold-leaf work for clients as diverse as north beach's stinking rose restaurant and facebook. and last year, new bohemia began participating in gallery exhibitions. \"i think, nationally, there's more of an interest in d.i.y., maybe partly due to the economic situation,\" mr. styer said. \"people are coming to us saying, 'we want something authentic.' \" the company's latest art show opened last week at guerrero gallery in the mission district. titled \"sign your life away,\" it was an opportunity for new bohemia workers to apply their professional technique to pieces not done for clients. new bohemia donated paint but does not profit from the work that is sold. just like the studio itself, the crowded salon-style hanging at the gallery creates a visual cacophony. shouting smart-alecky phrases like carnival barkers on a boardwalk (\"what's the sign you've been waiting for?\" and \"you've been warned\"), the multitude of signs makes an overwhelming yet moving paean to the form. the show also features jeff canham, a bay area artist who used to work at new bohemia, and steven powers, a high-profile graffiti artist whose colorful text-based work has been influenced from his time working with traditional sign painters. like silk-screening and letterpress operations, sign painting is benefiting from a general resurgence of interest in hand-done crafts. a documentary about sign painters is to be released in early 2012, and new businesses, like golden west sign arts in berkeley and best dressed signs in boston, started by josh luke, a new bohemia alumnus, are hanging up shingles. mr. styer said business at new bohemia had been brisk. earlier this year, the company moved into a space \"at least\" double the size of its former studio. andres guerrero, proprietor of guerrero gallery, used the word \"authentic\" in describing the exhibition's appeal noting as well that fans of sign painting run the gamut from graffiti enthusiasts to typography nerds. \"we could all use photoshop all day and make letters,\" mr. guerrero said. \"yet there's this element of hand your style, how you control things.\" hand-painted signs will probably never go back to the glory days of the 20th century, when itinerant \"wall dogs\" would go on \"sign snapping\" trips across the country, drumming up business. but then, 30 years ago, the advent of vinyl sign-cutting technology turned the industry on its head. \"until the 1980s, all outdoor visual communication was done by a person who did it by hand,\" said sam macon, who is co-directing the film \"sign painters: stories from an american trade\" with faythe levine. \"vinyl decimated the community.\" wade swormstedt, editor of signs of the times magazine, agreed, saying that in 2010, sign companies that used paint comprised 43 percent of the non-electric sign industry, down from 59 percent in 2000. but mr. swormstedt also said he thinks that hand-painted signs \"would never go away.\" outside of industry trends, new bohemia has been cultivating a close-knit community of artist sign-painters, many of whom have garnered success in the fine-art world. when mr. styer took over the business in 1999 (it was founded in 1993), he was its sole employee. but through talented apprentices like tauba auerbach a participant in the 2010 whitney biennial who worked with mr. styer for three years before moving to new york city in 2008 and mr. canham, who is known for his graphic design as well as hand-painted artworks, a new generation was exposed to the craft. plying the sign-painting trade at new bohemia has affected their art, the artists said. \"it totally changed,\" mr. canham said, speaking of his mixed-media work. whereas before he had improvised a technique for his letter-based art, the sign shop instilled a discipline and appreciation for new materials. ms. auerbach wrote in an e-mail, \"i can't imagine a more perfect job for me at the time.\" she sought out new bohemia in 2002 and she said the experience helped hone her pursuit of \"that illusive sweet spot\" between precision and speed. new bohemia is not currently planning any more gallery shows, but with so much interest in the shop, the staff will begin offering classes this summer. and every month, mr. styer said, a steady stream of young people knock on the door, many with artistic aspirations. he counsels patience, saying, \"you have to master the craft before you start bending it.\"",

        "title": "price of oil rises again, rattling the markets.",
        "abstract": "houston a sharp increase in oil prices on wednesday sent shudders through anxious financial markets already worried about the prospect of a global economic slowdown. crude oil climbed above $144 a barrel before settling at $143.57, up $2.60 for the day. the energy department reported an unexpected decline in inventories, sending oil prices to a record. and now oil slowly is closing in on $150 a barrel, the next psychological milestone to be crossed. the standard & poor's 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent and the dow jones industrial average fell 166.75 points, or 1.5 percent, and is now down nearly 21 percent from its peak in october. a 20 percent drop in major stock indexes is considered the start of a bear market. shares in energy, materials and industrial companies led the market down. analysts said the rapid rise in commodity prices had become a problem for both users and producers of raw materials and energy. since reaching a new high on may 20, energy stocks in the s.& p. 500 have fallen 5 percent as crude oil futures have shot up 11 percent. recent data on industrial activity and driving habits suggest that higher prices are damping demand for commodities, especially energy, and slowing down the global economy. shares of general motors fell 15 percent, to their lowest level since 1954, after an analyst at merrill lynch said a bankruptcy filing by the automaker was \"not impossible.\" shares of nucor, a steel maker, fell more than 14 percent as investors worried about weakening demand. \"as the energy price spikes higher, it's crimping global growth further,\" said tobias levkovich, chief equity strategist at citigroup. \"it's starting to be a real challenge for global economies.\" the automotive group aaa reported that the average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline on wednesday rose to $4.09, a half-cent higher than the day before, almost 12 cents higher than a month ago, and $1.14 above the price of a year ago. the single largest component in the price of a gallon of gasoline is the price of crude oil. it almost seems like ancient history since a single trader, apparently looking for bragging rights, bid up the price of crude over $100 by buying a small lot on jan. 2 and then immediately selling it at a small loss. political unrest, a cold winter and declining oil inventories were singled out as culprits for the jump past $100. since then, the prices of oil and gasoline have just kept rising. over the last three months, the average retail price of unleaded regular gasoline was $3.75 a gallon, nearly 65 cents higher than the average price in the first quarter of the year, according to the oil price information service. the research group has estimated that americans are now spending $1.6 billion a day on gasoline, which would make july the first month ever when the american gasoline bill would top $50 billion. tom kloza, the group's chief oil analyst, predicted that a barrel of oil would reach $155 by august and that retail prices for gasoline would rise to $4.25 to $4.50 a gallon for unleaded regular. \"the firecrackers are going off in the oil market and it will burn the u.s. consumers this holiday weekend,\" mr. kloza said. he added that truckers stood to suffer most, noting that diesel prices rose 13 cents a gallon wednesday afternoon in response to the energy department report. \"diesel is the bullet with the most acceleration at the moment,\" he said. \" you are going to see a lot of bankruptcies in the trucking business.\" pushing up the price of crude are any number of factors, including continued instability in nigeria, a partial strike at venezuela's state oil company and reports that israel is considering an attack on iran. yet another reason for oil's price climb came with the energy department's weekly statistical bulletin, which showed that crude oil stocks had slipped by nearly 2 million barrels to below 300 million barrels. analysts say that level is psychologically important because crude oil stocks as recently as last year were above 350 million barrels. the inventory level was the lowest since january, and below what most analysts had expected. the crude oil inventory figure was 54 million barrels below a year ago, and nearly 22 million barrels below the five-year average, according to tabulations by barclays capital. there was also some modestly good news in the report. gasoline inventories rose 2.1 million barrels to 210.9 million barrels, an indication that gasoline demand is slackening a bit as drivers car-pool, buy more efficient cars, and use more mass transit when it is available. but while the energy department report showed refineries increasing operations a bit, several experts cautioned that gasoline inventories traditionally come down in july and august. this year should be no different, they said, since refineries are having trouble making a profit on gasoline because gasoline prices have not kept pace with oil prices. weak profits in the refining business is one reason that energy stocks have been taking a beating, said sam stovall, chief investment strategist for standard & poor's equity research. shares in oil refining and marketing companies in the s.& p. 500-stock index are down more than 47 percent for the year. in response to the rising cost of oil and gradually falling gasoline demand, refiners have been cutting their production rates for months. \"with the weakness in refinery margins, refiners have had no incentive to build crude oil inventories,\" said lawrence j. goldstein, an energy analyst at the energy policy research foundation, a group backed by the oil industry. \"in fact, they have been liquidating crude oil inventories. it means that the system is running on a tight basis.\" that tightness means higher gasoline prices even as the national demand for oil is easing for the first time in nearly two decades. the department of energy reports that gasoline demand for the week that ended june 27 was down 2.1 percent from the same week a year ago. in comparison, demand for distillate fuels, which include heating oil and diesel, was up nearly 7 percent. \"supply is struggling to grow worldwide and the feeling is prices have to rise to choke off demand growth,\" said aaron f. brady, an analyst at cambridge energy research associates, a consulting firm affiliated with ihs inc. \"i don't see any barriers,\" he added, to further price rises. the sentiment for ever higher oil prices was summed up in a headline on a daily energy note written on wednesday by chris ruppel, an energy analyst with execution, an institutional brokerage firm: \"oil: $300 on the radar screen.\" mr. ruppel says he thinks the $300 price what he calls \"iran war insurance\" is unlikely. but he said that investors bought nearly 2,000 call option contracts on june 27, permitting them to buy nymex crude at $300 a barrel for december delivery. \"those buying these options may want to trust iranian assurances, but without verification they need the insurance,\" mr. ruppel wrote.",

        "abstract": "painstaking vote counts. talk of possible fraud. suggestions of racism and ageism, and disparaging comments about people with disabilities. and none of it had anything to do with donald j. trump. with the presidential election fast receding into the past, there was still campaign drama unfolding on wednesday on the south shore of long island, where the race for new york state senate's eighth district has been contested with the ardor and election board intrigue of the bush-gore contest in florida in 2000. the race pitted the incumbent, michael venditto, a first-term republican with some family political baggage, against john e. brooks, a former insurance executive who now seems tantalizingly close to capturing a seat that few democrats thought was winnable until recently. by late wednesday afternoon, mr. brooks a longtime republican running as a democrat had declared victory after a count of absentee and affidavit ballots. with more than 130,000 votes now recorded, mr. brooks had a razor-thin lead of 41 votes, according to david j. gugerty, the democratic commissioner of elections in nassau county, which makes up the bulk of the district. mr. brooks issued a statement announcing himself \"humbled and honored,\" though state republican officials did not concede, noting that the validity of 1,000 or so uncounted ballots was being challenged by both sides. \"there are still more than a thousand ballots to be examined beginning next week under the supervision of a judge,\" scott reif, a spokesman for the senate republicans, said. \"despite an effort by the democrats to shut this down prematurely, this race is far from over.\" still, senator andrea stewart-cousins, who leads the senate democrats, was confident enough that mr. brooks had won to call on gov. andrew m. cuomo, a democrat, \"to step up and unify the members of his party.\" with a victory, democrats would have a numeric majority in the 63-seat senate, though republicans, led by john j. flanagan of long island, have been clinging to power by dint of the continuing defection of simcha felder, a democrat from brooklyn who sits and votes with the republicans. \"once again, a majority of our state senators in new york are democrats, and for some reason there is the mind-boggling question about who controls the senate,\" ms. stewart-cousins said. \"at this critical juncture in our nation's history, it is more important than ever that democrats stick together to hold the line against expected draconian efforts out of washington to roll back and prevent progressive achievements.\" ms. stewart-cousins's remarks were echoed by good government and liberal groups, including the working families party, which has had a fraught relationship with the governor. bill lipton, the party's state director, said that mr. cuomo should take the lead in turning the senate democratic and in offering \"a clear progressive alternative.\" \"if the governor wants to help lead the national opposition to trump,\" mr. lipton said, \"he can start in his own backyard.\" image mr. brooks credit james escher/newsday mr. cuomo's office said on wednesday that it was monitoring the vote count in the eighth district. the state republicans cheered when mr. venditto jumped to an early lead of some 400 votes as the count began. in recent days, however, ballots have been counted in more heavily democratic areas, giving mr. brooks's an advantage. the counting has also led to some unsavory accusations on both sides. mr. reif, the senate republican spokesman, said on wednesday that democratic lawyers monitoring the count at the nassau county board of elections were discriminating against older, infirm republicans by challenging their ballots. \"democrats are objecting to permanently disabled elderly republican voters, claiming their signatures don't match what is in the books,\" mr. reif said. \"this is a new low.\" democrats denied that claim, and leveled an accusation of their own: that lawyers working on behalf of mr. venditto had been purposely challenging ballots coming out of heavily black and latino parts of the district, owing to those groups' traditional support of democratic candidates. mike murphy, a democratic spokesman, said the objections were \"for almost no reason, except that they are in minority areas.\" about two-thirds of the objections came from republicans, suggesting that democrats were more confident about their chances of maintaining a lead in the race. \"our objections are legitimate and real,\" mr. reif said, \"and are of much higher quality than the democrats.\" despite such disputes, the impact of a win for mr. brooks was unclear, in large part because of mr. felder, who represents a district that is heavily orthodox jewish and who confirmed last week that he would continue to conference with the republicans. also complicating the math is the seven-member independent democratic conference, led by senator jeffrey d. klein of the bronx and westchester county, who has been working in what he calls a \"bipartisan coalition\" with republicans for the past four years. that coalition has repeatedly said it would remain separate from the rest of the elected democratic senators led by ms. stewart-cousins , who were disappointed by their performance in november. with hillary clinton, the democratic presidential candidate, winning the state easily , ms. stewart-cousins and others in her party had hoped to win enough seats to secure a solid senate majority. (the state assembly is dominated by democrats.) but new york republicans, who saw mr. trump win handily in rural and some suburban areas, actually gained a seat , winning in buffalo. the race in the eighth district was an outlier: it had long been thought to be a lock for mr. venditto, as the district has typically voted republican. but in october, mr. venditto's father, john, the town supervisor of oyster bay, was arrested on federal corruption charges that also swept up a fellow republican, edward p. mangano, the nassau county executive. jay jacobs, the nassau county democratic chairman, said he was confident that mr. brooks had enough votes to clinch the eighth district seat, despite pending challenges, including 727 from republicans and 346 from democrats. \"right now our team is projecting a brooks win by more than 300,\" mr. jacobs said. \"then again, we projected helping hillary out on her transition.\"",

        "abstract": "ocucaje, peru nestled between the andes and the pacific, the sparse desert surrounding this outpost in southern peru looks like one of the world's most desolate areas. barren mountains rise from windswept valleys. dust devils dance from one dune to the next. but to the bone hunters who stalk the ocucaje desert each day, the punishing winds here have exposed a medley of life and evolution: a prehistoric graveyard where sea monsters came to rest 40 million years ago. these parched lands, once washed over by the sea, guard one of the most coveted troves of marine fossils known to paleontology. discoveries here include gigantic fossilized teeth from the legendary 50-foot shark called the megalodon , the bones of a huge penguin with surprisingly colorful feathers and the fossils of the leviathan melvillei , a whale with teeth longer than those of the tyrannosaurus rex, making it a contender for the largest predator ever to prowl the oceans. \"this is perhaps the best area in the world for marine mammals,\" said christian de muizon, 58, a paleontologist at the natural history museum in paris who led an expedition here in november. he ranks the ocucaje (pronounced oh-coo-cah-heh) and adjacent sections of desert with top fossil areas like liaoning province in china, where ashfall famously preserved plumed dinosaurs . but beyond the boon to science, the discoveries here have attracted the attentions of another class of fossil hunters as well: smugglers. officials in the capital, lima, say seizures of illegally collected fossils are climbing. peru is astonishingly rich in archaeological and paleontological sites, so much so that the issue is part of a delicate political debate here. the loss of national treasures to collectors from abroad has set off concerns about sovereignty, perhaps best exemplified by the feud between peru and yale university over inca artifacts taken by hiram bingham, the american explorer typically credited with revealing the lost city of machu picchu to the outside world a century ago. for now, the ocucaje remains open to just about anyone who wants to search for fossils here. peruvian law, while vague, classifies fossils as national patrimony and requires fossils found in the country to remain in peru, unless special permission is granted. but enforcement and preservation here seems like a distant dream. the government controls the desert but leases parts to mining companies, which could damage or destroy fossils. looters have already ravaged archaeological burial sites on the desert's fringes. the police rarely even enter the area. almost the only four-wheeled vehicles one sees traversing the desert are trucks carrying workers who spend weeks on the coast collecting seaweed. they sell to dealers, who then export it to asia. \"this desert is horrible,\" said yolanda gutierrez, 35, a seaweed harvester. \"the only things a person sees are dirt and rocks and bones.\" an assortment of fossil hunters have their own visions of how the ocucaje should be managed. one prominent view comes from roberto penny cabrera, 54, a former naval officer who says he is a descendant of jeronimo luis de cabrera, the conquistador who founded the nearby city of ica in 1563. mr. penny cabrera, who guides both backpackers and paleontologists into the ocucaje, lives in his aristocratic family's crumbling yellow mansion on ica's square. \"i am a patriot, a peruvian, and where my foot steps that is patrimony,\" he said, contending that some of the ocucaje's fossils should be left in the ground. another option, he said, would be to create a museum not in lima, much less berlin or paris but in ica. on the streets of ica and nearby towns, visitors can already see such fossils and buy them. merchants sell fossilized shark teeth, about the size of a man's hand, at prices from $60 to $100 apiece. they say other fossils are available, at higher prices. \"ocucaje yields many bones,\" said one merchant, marcos conde, 35. meanwhile, seizures of illegally obtained fossils are increasing, surpassing 2,200 this year, compared with about 800 last year, largely at lima's international airport, said jose apolin of the ministry of culture's office of recovery. sometimes officials stumble upon large fossils by chance; in 2008 the police found a jawbone thought to be that of a mastodon in the cargo hold of a bus. recent discoveries elsewhere in peru are raising interest in the country's fossils and the potential for more trafficking. almost 14,000 feet high in the andes, for instance, a mining company controlled by australian and swiss investors announced a startling discovery last year: more than 100 dinosaur footprints embedded in walls of stone. rodolfo salas, paleontology curator at lima's natural history museum, said evidence that his institution obtained, including photos of fossils for sale by private dealers, showed that the ocucaje was especially vulnerable. he said the trade was supported by huaqueros, or looters of archaeological sites, who turned to fossil hunting. paleontologists working here fear the robbery of their discoveries. after finding a fossil thought to be a 35-million-year-old whale cranium, the team led by mr. de muizon camouflaged the find with burlap before it could be removed to hide it from looters. the fossil hunters sometimes turn on one another, too. in 2008, mr. penny cabrera, who roams the ocucaje in a battered four-wheel-drive nissan, pushed for the authorities to arrest mario urbina-schmitt, 48, a well-known researcher for peru's natural history museum, while he was working with a french paleontologist, gilles cuny. mr. urbina-schmitt, who faces time in prison if convicted on charges of illegally removing fossils, said the case against him was absurd, revealing disarray in properly regulating fossil collection. he also said the focus on his case had shifted attention away from other episodes, like a 40-million-year-old whale fossil spirited out of the desert. \"my crime is that i do good work,\" he said. the debate over trafficking aside, paleontologists say the prized fossils of the ocucaje remain vulnerable to yet another factor: erosion. \"if we leave them in the desert,\" mr. de muizon said of the ocucaje fossils, \"they will be dead for the second time.\"",
