post office accounting procedures is revised to reflect segmented inventory accountability (sia) changes in section 4.8 managing accountable paper and cash at offices with segmented inventory accountability. we will incorporate these changes into the next printed version of handbook f1 and into the online version located on the corporate intranet at <url> (click on information, then policies and procedures, then handbooks). handbook f1 post office accounting procedures 4. managing accountable paper 4.8 managing accountable paper and cash at offices with segmented inventory accountability revise 4.8.1 to read as follows: 4.8.1 overview segmented inventory accountability (sia) is a financial concept used at postal service retail units with pos one (point - of - service) terminals. each unit must contain and maintain a unit reserve stock and has a number of different segments. a window services employee is identified as a sales and services associate (ssa) and an associate's role determines his or her access and responsibility for the assigned inventory segments. employees (ssa) working at window services do not have a stamp stock inventory assigned as individual accountability. instead, they work from a shared retail floor stock. ssas working from the retail floor stock are assigned. revise title and text of 4.8.1.1 to read as follows: 4.8.1.1 retail floor stock the major change incorporated in this section is the inclusion of the concept of retail floor stock. under this concept, two modifications are made to traditional controls. first, cash is separated from stamp stock in retail credits. second, a shared retail floor stock replaces individual stamp credits for ssas. revise 4.8.2 to read as follows: 4.8.2 responsibility for retail unit operations the postmaster/unit manager or supervisor is responsible for compliance with the procedures defined in this section. key elements of this responsibility include establishing and controlling segments within the unit, monitoring inventory levels, ensuring proper entry of all financial transactions, remittance of all funds in excess of authorized reserves, and monitoring of operations including count procedures. the postmaster/unit manager or supervisor is responsible for providing adequate security for all accountable items. revise 4.8.2.2 to read as follows: 4.8.2.2 responsibility for inventory items, cash, and equipment it is the responsibility of all employees to ensure: financial integrity; security of all postal stock, funds, equipment, and facilities; reporting of all retail transactions to include providing a receipt to each customer. in pos one sites using the pos one cash drawers for all daily transactions as they occur (see section 15.14.2). employees are accountable for: cash directly assigned to them; money order stock directly assigned to them; stamp stock directly assigned to them; correct collection and remittal of all funds due the postal service. revise 4.8.3 to read as follows: 4.8.3 unit reserve responsibility 1. the unit reserve is assigned to the postmaster, unit manager, supervisor, or finance clerk lead ssa at a finance station. a finance station has no domiciled supervisor and has no more than three full - time ssas assigned to the unit. a finance clerk lead ssa may also be assigned a credit from which direct sales to the public are conducted. 2. at other units where no supervisor is domiciled, the unit reserve stock may be assigned to a window service technician lead ssa. when the unit reserve stock is assigned to a window service technician lead ssa, that employee may not also have accountability for any credit from which sales are made directly to the public. 3. the individual assigned to the unit reserve is referred to as unit reserve custodian. the unit reserve custodian is directly accountable for the value of all items in the unit reserve stock. 4. assignment of the unit reserve stock is made using form 3369p (consigned credit receipt) and all counts of the unit reserve are posted to form 3368p (accountability examination record). 5. a pos one unit reserve financial report (form 3958 - main stock or unit reserve stock transaction record, stamp stock unit 1412, or an irt form 3958) is prepared and signed every day that transactions affect the unit reserve stock. 6. the unit reserve contains items listed in section 4.13 of this handbook. the unit reserve custodian maintains and secures all accountable papers for the unit beyond the levels authorized for the various segments. the employees assigned to the various segments within the retail unit obtain these items directly from the unit reserve. 7. the unit reserve stamp stock is maintained at the required 9 - week stock level in compliance with section 4.22.2. do not exceed the 9 - week sales level for your office. 4.8.4 segments revise 4.8.4.1 to read as follows: 4.8.4.1 definition segments define the assignment of cash or stamp stock to various individuals or roles within a unit. on each unit's system - generated form 1412 (daily financial report), the total of all stamp stock is posted in aic 853 (stamp accountability closing balance). in both the pos one system and on the irts, the clerk balance list generates a report of the balance of each segment's stock. the total value of stock computed on the clerk balance list must always equal the unit's total reported in aic 853 on the daily financial report. the clerk balance list will always include a unit reserve, a retail floor stock, and may include other segments such as mobile unit, philatelic, or self - service vending. similarly, the unit's daily financial report (form 1412) has a total of aic 753 (cash retained). this is defined on the clerk balance list by listing the unit's cash retained reserve plus the various assigned associates' cash retained credits. note: rural carrier credits and stamps on consignment are included in the unit reserve accountability. they are fixed amounts entered into the unit reserve total as unique item numbers and are not segments. replenishment is made by purchasing stock from retail floor stock. revise 4.8.4.2 to read as follows: 4.8.4.2 segments assigned from the unit reserve segments assigned from the unit reserve include: vending self - service credits: stock for sale through vending equipment is assigned to the self - service postal center (sspc) technician or designated employee who is directly accountable for that inventory. this credit is replenished directly from the unit reserve to the designated employee to whom the credit is assigned, unless this function is supported by the stamp distribution office (sdo) or stamp service center (ssc) as a separate unit id. mobile unit credits: stock for use by associates assigned to operate mobile units is issued directly from the unit reserve. this credit is accountable to an individual. philatelic units or dedicated windows: where a dedicated philatelic credit is used, stock is issued directly from the unit reserve. the credit is accountable to an individual. retail floor stock: stock for this inventory is issued from the unit reserve. the purpose is to provide a common inventory for use by the associates in units as defined in section 4.8.1.1. this credit is not accountable to any individual. stamps by mail, where volume prohibits filling requisitions by an associate: stock for this inventory is issued from the unit reserve. the purpose is to provide an inventory for use in filling stamp orders received from customers by mail or fax. this credit is accountable to an individual. note: special event credits. on occasion, the postal service establishes credits associated with special events. temporary credits can be assigned to one of the accountable segments with stock issued directly from the unit reserve. at the completion of the event, all sales must be posted. a count is conducted and the balance is either returned to the unit reserve, prepared for destruction, or moved to retail floor stock. revise 4.8.4.3 to read as follows: 4.8.4.3 documentation of stock assignment 4.8.4.3.1 pos one offices 1. assignments of all individually accountable credits and unit reserve stock are documented by the completion of form 3369. in these instances, assigned employees are accountable for all stock (accountable paper, money orders, and money in their respective credits). 2. for stamps on consignment, the contract serves as documentation for the credit. 3. retail floor stock is issued directly from the unit reserve. although no individual is accountable for this stock, each associate making sales from this credit is responsible for ensuring adequate protection and security of postal service resources. 4. form 17 (stamp requisition) or an approved electronic equivalent is retained to document shipments of stock from the unit reserve to retail floor stock and from retail floor stock back to the unit reserve. the unit reserve stock custodian signs the form 17 as shipped or received as appropriate. an associate must independently count all stock moved into and out of the retail floor stock and sign the appropriate form 17 as witnessed or verified by. revise title and text of 4.8.4.3.2 to read as follows: 4.8.4.3.2 retail postal stores with irts 1. associates selling from the retail floor stock segment at irt units must maintain stock balances to operate the irt. although these associates have a stock value listed on the clerk balance list, they are not individually accountable for this balance and no form 3369 is required. 2. the irts do not have the ability to accommodate the retail floor stock segment. in essence, since each associate has to maintain a stock balance to operate the irt, the retail floor stock is valued at the total of all associates' irt balances. even though each individual associate working from credits that represent the retail floor segment has a balance listed on the clerk balance list, none are held to be individually responsible for that listed value. the total of balances for all associates operating from the retail floor stock must at all times be equal to the total retail. 3. in this irt environment, each shipment of stock into or out of the unit reserve must be documented on a form 17. the exact item numbers and quantities shipped to the retail floor stock from the unit reserve must be shipped by the unit reserve custodian and witnessed by one of the associates operating in the retail floor stock segment with signatures required. ensure that stock shipped to the retail floor stock is adequately distributed among the associates to maintain an operational balance. in some instances, stock credit will have to be transferred between associates to maintain operating stock balances. 4. stock returned from retail floor stock must be documented on form 17 also. the stock is independently verified by an associate and the stock custodian. an associate witnesses the form 17 and the stock custodian receives the stock with signatures required. 4.8.5 retail floor stock revise 4.8.5.1 to read as follows: 4.8.5.1 definition retail floor stock is a common inventory used by associates in units as defined in section 4.8.1.1. this stock is not assigned to an individual. retail floor stock is divided into two major components: display stock, which is only used in postal retail stores, comprises the following two items: open merchandise stock: shrink - wrapped stamp stock and philatelic products that are displayed in the open merchandising area accessible to the general public on the slat wall or gondola. closed merchandise stock: stamp stock and philatelic products displayed in the retail clerk area inaccessible to the general public and non - retail employees. loose stock: accountable paper held as a common credit available to all associates in a designated.",

        "text": "home blogs. charles gabas blog. the silverswitcharoo is a great workaround for almost everyone. almost. previous story. next story. the silverswitcharoo is a great workaround for almost everyone. almost. sun 07/01/2018 8:23pm. for nearly a year, healthcare wonks like myself, david anderson, andrew sprung, and louise norris have been heavily getting the word out to promote not just the silver loading (csrload) workaround, but an even more clever variant which i've coined the silver switcharoo, which takes the concept of silver loading and goes one step further. it gets a bit complicated, but here's my explainer of how the silver switcharoo works for aca individual market policies. the bottom line is that, in theory - on paper - just about everyone either comes out ahead or at least is no worse off if they use silver switching. subsidized enrollees in silver plans end up paying the same as they did before. subsidized enrollees in bronze plans end up paying far less, and in some cases nothing at all in premiums. subsidized enrollees in gold or platinum plans end up paying far less in premiums, and in some cases less than they would for silver plans. unsubsidized enrollees in bronze, gold, or platinum plans end up paying only whatever the normal premium increase is - that is, without any csr load on or off exchange. unsubsidized enrollees in silver plans can also avoid paying any csr load by moving to an off - exchange silver plan. everyone wins, or at least no one loses, right? well, as norris reminds everyone, there's one exception to this win - win situation. but there's a downside that has to be considered. as described above, you can't switch from an off - exchange plan to an on - exchange plan in the middle of the year, unless you have a qualifying event, and a change in income is not a qualifying event. so if you're in a state that allows the silver switch option and your income is too high for premium subsidies, you can sign up for a lower - cost off - exchange silver plan during open enrollment. but if your income drops during the year to a subsidy - eligible level, you won't be able to switch to an on - exchange plan at that point. you'd essentially be stuck with your full - price off - exchange plan until the end of the year. so it's a gamble. do you pay a higher rate for the on - exchange silver plan just in case you do end up being eligible for subsidies (you can go back and claim them on your tax return if your income for the year makes you eligible, but only if you bought the plan through the exchange)? or you do take the silver switch option and go for the lower - priced off - exchange silver plan, knowing that there's no way to get subsidies later in the year, even if your income declines? there's no right answer to this question, but it's something to keep in mind when you're deciding where to buy your coverage. it's worth noting that a potential solution would be to buy an on - exchange bronze or gold plan in this situation instead of a silver plan. you wouldn't have the cost of csr added to your premiums, but you'd also be able to start getting premium subsidies mid - year if your income were to decline, or go back and claim the subsidy on your tax return after the year is over. as i've noted many times before, my own family could be faced with this situation in 2018 and/or 2019, depending on how the year goes. we're both self - employed, and our income is highly variable from year to year. we might only make 300% of the federal poverty line one year, but 500% the next, or vice versa. since the aca's subsidy cutoff point is 400% fpl, that presented an annual dilemma for us, even before the csr cutoff and silver loading/switching became a thing. here's the problem. 100% fpl for one person is $12,140 this year. 400% of that is $48,560. let's say you're a single adult without kids, just over that threshold - around $50,000/year. you earn just barely too much to qualify for aca tax credits, so you have to pay full price for you policy, regardless of metal level, and whether you buy on or off exchange. in this case, assuming you're 48 years old, living here in oakland county, michigan, a silver plan will cost around $425/month, $5,100/year, or 10.2% of your income. if you're absolutely certain that you're going to earn at least $50k/year next year as well, then it doesn't matter whether you buy on or off the exchange, since you wouldn't be eligible for subsides regardless. however, what if you have a variable income? let's say there's a chance you'll have a bad year and will only earn, say, $45,000 (370% fpl). if that happens, you will qualify for subsidies. in that case, you'd likely qualify for $66/month in tax credits, $792/year, so you'd only end up paying a total of $4,308 for the year, 9.6% of your income. but here's the catch. you'd only qualify for that $792 if you had enrolled in the on - exchange silver plan. if you enrolled in the exact same policy (or any other one) off exchange, you wouldn't qualify for any subsidies, no matter how crappy your income ends up being for the year in question. this, by the way, is likely the main reason why around 15% of on - exchange enrollees are consistently unsubsidized each year - there's a chunk of mostly self - employed people like my wife and i who probably don't qualify for subsidies, but enroll through the aca exchange anyway, just in case they have a bad year and end up qualifying after all. with silver loading, the stakes are even higher, because the gap between a subsidized and unsubsidized silver plan is even greater. as norris notes, it can be tricky for folks in this situation to know what the best route to take is. again, if you're certain that you'll earn over 400% fpl in 2019, go for the off - exchange plan. if you think there's a reasonable chance of falling below the 400% threshold, however, you might want to go for an on - exchange gold or bronze plan instead - just in case. update: it's important to note that folks caught in this situation may have another option available to them. there are several money management strategies they can use to try and keep their official magi income below the 400% fpl threshold. andrew sprung of xpostfactoid, along with norris, lays out some of them here. many, but not all, resources for reducing magi are available only to the self - employed. they include the following: 1. individual 401(k). ms. cornwell, the article reports, made $80,000 a year as a project manager for a small consulting firm that doesn't offer health insurance. my immediate reaction was that an employee of a consultancy that doesn't offer health insurance (or it emerges later, a 401(k)) should be able to get herself paid as a contractor (i.e., get self - employed status). if she did, she'd be able to deduct as much income as she forfeited, or more if she so chose. 2. health savings account (hsas) are tax - sheltered savings accounts that must be paired with a so - called high deductible health plans (hdhp). an hdhp must have a minimum deductible of $1,300 for an individual and $2,600 for a family - rather quaint thresholds at a time when the average silver plan has a deductible approaching $4,000 and the average gold plan deductible is over $1,000. 3. roth ira or non - retirement savings. this one is for the relatively affluent. let's say you're in your early 60s, like ms. cornwell, and you want to retire early without taking early social security or drawing on your main retirement income source (say, a 401(k)). withdrawals from a roth ira are not taxable income (in roth iras, contributions are not tax - deductible when made, but withdrawals after age 59 1/2 can be made tax - free). 4. self - employed health insurance deduction. if you're self - employed and buying insurance for yourself and/or your family on the individual market, you can deduct the full cost of the insurance as long as your self - employment income exceeds the cost of insurance after various other deductions. this too is an above - the - line deduction that reduces magi. 5. qualified business expenses. if you're self - employed and fill out a schedule c (profit or loss from business), consider being more liberal in spending to grow your business or improve your capabilities than you might normally be inclined to be. it may do your business good. note: norris points out to me that things get a little circular when the deduction increases the subsidy, thereby reducing the cost of insurance and reducing the deduction. louise points to the appropriate irs instructions for squaring this circle here. charles gabas blog. silver switcharoo. silver loading. oe6. csrs.",

        "text": "opinion: xinhua news agency, landov. \"the enduring influence of the crusades: how muslim extremists and american conservatives came to find comfort in crusade metaphors\", july 15, 2014, 6:00 am et by nick danforth (nicholasdanfort). on july 15, 1099 - 915 years ago to the day - jerusalem fell to the knights of the first crusade, launching a powerful metaphor for the apparently implacable civilizational conflict between islam and christianity. the abbreviated version of the story goes something like this: a western army invades a middle eastern country, relying on military technology to shock and awe a numerically superior muslim opponent. after achieving a seemingly decisive victory, the triumphant invaders set out to build a new state based on the prevailing european political model. the parallel is crude and reductive, yet remains popular with both muslim extremists and american conservatives alike. so instead of rehashing an old narrative 915 years after it happened, let's consider the odd story of how the crusades, in all their messy historical detail, became a lasting symbol for muslim - christian relations. rather than look for overly precise political parallels in the 11th, 19th and 21st centuries, we should consider how selectively and effectively the language of holy war has been invoked throughout history, often to the mutual benefit of opposite sides in the same conflict. the way we talk about the crusades tells us a lot more about the world we live in than the crusades themselves could. crusade nostalgia for the better part of a millennium after they ended, no one in either western europe or the middle east cared much about the crusades. the christian world was more wrapped up in its greek and roman past, and when muslim thinkers considered foreign invaders, they were more likely to remember the trauma of the mongols. things started to change with the rise of european nationalism in the 19th century, when patriotic historians rediscovered the crusades as heroic examples of french, british or german chivalry and martial valor. this fascination famously flourished in world war i, when medieval legend offered. the most enthusiastic participants in the crusades started out as dirt - encrusted freeloaders with an enthusiasm for sacking the temples they claimed to protect. europe's interest in its crusader history peaked right around the time of its colonial exploits in the middle east. that was hardly a coincidence. when t.e. lawrence of arabia fame first went to the middle east at 17, he got a camel, an arab guide and a gun and set about researching his senior thesis at oxford. his subject, naturally, was the architecture of crusader castles. and as europeans wrapped their imperial mission in crusades rhetoric, colonized people were quick to pick up on it. if europeans cast themselves as christian knights finishing the crusaders' work, it is little surprise their opponents would start to identify with saladin, the muslim commander who famously recaptured jerusalem. then as now, the crusades served as an excellent metaphor for enemies to better articulate their enmity. after world war i, crusader - themed nationalism proved particularly popular with europe's fascist right, which is part of the reason that it lost its luster in the west. but among those who still found themselves subject to western power for the rest of the 20th century, crusades rhetoric remained popular, especially when it became associated with israel. there is a particularly sad irony, though, in the contemporary pairing of zionists and crusaders. the crusades, as many people know, were an unmitigated disaster for jews. vicious pogroms accompanied the crusaders' progress through europe and the middle east. but there is also irony. europe's interest in its crusader history peaked right around the time of its colonial exploits in the middle east. that was hardly a coincidence when lawrence of arabia first went to the middle east at age 17, he got a camel, an arab guide and a gun and set about researching his senior thesis at oxford. his subject, naturally, was the architecture of crusader castles. and as europeans wrapped their imperial mission in crusader rhetoric, colonized people were quick to pick up on it. if europeans cast themselves as christian knights finishing the crusaders' work, it is little surprise their opponents would start to identify with saladin, the muslim commander who famously recaptured jerusalem. then as now, the crusades served as an excellent metaphor for enemies to better articulate their enmity. after world war one, crusader -

model wargame enthusiasts, owe their relative anonymity to the fact that despite their historical importance, no present - day nation has quite claimed them as ancestors. the swedes have the vikings and the irish have the celtics, but no one has a sports franchise named after the normans. the normans were more or less vikings who settled in northern france (normandy) in the 10th century, learned french and converted to christianity before conquering england, ireland and sicily, then setting off for the middle east. as a result, they're too scandinavian for the french, too french for the scandinavians, and way too french for the english. but their conquests explain a good deal about the modern world: why southern italians are catholic and not muslim or greek orthodox; why lazy english - speaking high school students prefer french to german (german is linguistically more closely related, but a huge number of french words entered our language with the norman conquest); and why fitzgerald is an irish name (it's a corruption of the french fils or son of gerald, signifying descent from one of the island's first anglo - norman conquerors). the normans also helped inspire many of our modern images of the middle ages, giving us much of the medieval pastiche that show up in places like game of thrones. that said, names from the norman era were often even better than the imitations they inspired. just a few: harold harefoot, harthacnut, swein forkbeard, charles the simple, hrolf (known as rollo), william longsword, william of the iron arm, flodoard, dudo of st quentin, the dux pyratorum (or duke of pirates), and robert the weasel (terror of the world). self - promotional piety as some of these names suggest, for all the cliches about chivalry, the normans' image among contemporaries often had more to do with their viking ancestry than their religiosity. in the words of one abbot, they were \"men more apt to destroy than to build the temples of the lord.\" the above - mentioned robert, as the most prominent norman leader in italy, was excommunicated three times. it is telling that one of his most pious moments occurred when, after crushing the pope's army in battle, he kissed the pontiff's feet and begged forgiveness for the victory. though not a cliche, they. on the other side of the crusades were the seljuqs, a dynasty that entered the islamic world as mounted warriors who rode in from the central asian steppes. in 1055, a decade before the norman conquest of england, they seized control of baghdad, becoming rulers of the abbassid caliphate and the greater middle east about half a century before the crusaders headed for jerusalem. like the normans, they did not always enjoy the best of reputations among their coreligionists. consider the words of caliphal envoy ahmad ibn fadlan. he included among the seljuqs' vices \"the shamelessness of their women, who were always unveiled and their brazenly exposing their pudenda.\" as it happened, the normans and the seljuqs were both eager to compensate for their lack of pious credentials, which helps explain how they ended up as protagonists in an epic religious war. for the normans, accepting christianity nominally at first was a stipulation for their being allowed to settle in northern france. subsequently, patronizing churches and monasteries became a crucial method to gain acceptance as a respectable part of their new society. likewise, when the seljuqs found themselves trying to rule the abbassid caliphate without any claim whatsoever to descent from the prophet muhammad, they reinvented themselves as defenders. some of the warriors who fought in the crusades were undoubtedly simple hypocrites, while others were almost certainly completely convinced by their own religious rhetoric. but in either case, exploiting the rhetorical possibilities of a holy war fit nicely with each side's tradition of self - promotional piety. so if we insist on making the crusades, in all their strange, messy historical complexity, a simplistic lesson about anything, it might as well be for that truism that the most enthusiastic participants in any mission often started out as dirt - encrusted freeloaders with an enthusiasm for sacking the temples they claimed to protect. like all historical metaphors, it's hardly perfect, but given what's going on across the middle east right now, it's not entirely inaccurate either. nick danforth is a phd candidate at georgetown university. he writes about middle east maps, history and politics at midafternoon map. the views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect al jazeera america's editorial policy. share this.",

        "text": "what is infertility? home. infertility. what is infertility? infertility is a condition of the reproductive system that prevents the conception of children. it affects approximately 10 - 15% of couples throughout the united states. the diagnosis of infertility is usually given to couples who have been attempting to conceive for at least 1 year without success. find a infertility specialist in your area. conception and pregnancy are complicated processes that depend upon a number of factors, including the production of healthy sperm by the man, healthy eggs produced by the woman, unblocked fallopian tubes that allow the sperm to reach the egg, the sperm's ability to fertilize the egg when they meet, the ability of the fertilized egg (embryo) to become implanted in the woman's uterus, sufficient embryo quality. finally, for the pregnancy to progress to full term, the embryo must be healthy and the woman's hormonal environment adequate for its development. if just one of these factors is impaired, infertility can be the result. is infertility primarily a woman's problem? it is a common assumption that infertility is primarily related to the woman. in reality, only one - third of infertility cases are related to the woman alone. statistically, one - third of infertility problems are related to men, and the remaining one - third is a combination of fertility factors involving both partners or unknown causes. unknown causes account for approximately twenty percent of infertility cases. what causes infertility in men? the most common causes of male infertility are azoospermia (no sperm cells are produced) and oligospermia (few sperm cells are produced). sometimes sperm cells are malformed or they die before they can reach the egg. in rare cases, infertility in men is caused by a genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis or a chromosomal abnormality. for men with low sperm count or motility issues, clinically proven supplements are available that can improve sperm parameters. spermcheck is a corporate sponsor of the american pregnancy association, and they provide an at - home semen analysis. you can learn more here. to help with your semen quality, you may shop male supplements. what causes infertility in women? the most common cause of female infertility is ovulation disorders. problems with ovulation affect about 25% of all infertility situations. other causes of female infertility include blocked fallopian tubes, which can happen when a woman has had pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis; congenital anomalies (birth defects involving the structure of the uterus); and uterine fibroids, which are associated with repeated miscarriages and aging, since the ability for ovaries to produce eggs tends to decline with age, especially after the age of 35. shop fertility supplements for her. when should someone get tested for infertility? the american society of reproductive medicine recommends that women under 35 begin testing after trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 12 months. the recommendation for women over 35 is to begin testing after trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 6 months. some couples or individuals find that they are more relaxed when trying to conceive if they believe that everything is normal. how early can you get tested? couples may request that their health care provider conduct an exam to determine if everything is healthy and working correctly. it is also possible to use over - the - counter screening tests, using testing kits to evaluate key aspects of fertility for both men and women. how is infertility diagnosed? as already noted, couples are generally advised to seek medical help if they are unable to achieve pregnancy after a year of unprotected intercourse. the doctor will conduct a physical examination of both partners to determine their general state of health and to search for physical disorders that may be contributing to infertility. the doctor will usually interview both partners about their sexual habits in order to determine whether intercourse is taking place properly for conception. if no cause can be determined at this point, more specific tests may be recommended. for women, these include an analysis of body temperature and ovulation, x - ray of the fallopian tubes and uterus, and laparoscopy. for men, initial tests focus on semen analysis. how is infertility treated? approximately 85 - 90% of infertility cases are treated with conventional therapies such as drug treatment or surgical repair of reproductive organs. assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization account for the remaining infertility treatment options. some people find it helpful to hear about the experiences of other infertile couples and to communicate with them. the pregnancy forums of apa or shared journey are sites where you can read and share stories. what is in vitro fertilization (ivf)? in cases of blocked or absent fallopian tubes or low sperm count, in vitro fertilization (ivf) offers couples the opportunity of biological parenthood. during ivf, eggs are surgically removed from the ovary and mixed with sperm outside the body in a petri dish. after about 40 hours, the eggs are examined to see if they have become fertilized by the sperm and are dividing into cells. these fertilized eggs (embryos) are then placed in the woman's uterus, bypassing the fallopian tubes. ivf has received a great deal of media attention since it was first introduced in 1978, and currently accounts for less than five percent of all infertility treatments in the united states. is in vitro fertilization expensive? the average cost of an ivf cycle in the united states is $12,400. like other extremely delicate medical procedures, ivf involves highly trained professionals with sophisticated laboratories and equipment, and the cycle might need to be repeated in order to be successful. while ivf and other assisted reproductive technologies are can be costly, they account for only three - hundredths of one percent (0.03%) of us health care costs. does in vitro fertilization work? ivf was introduced in the united states in 1981. according to society of assisted reproductive technology (sart), who tracks art success rates in the us, ivf currently accounts for more than 99% of art procedures, with gift, zift and combination procedures making up the remainder. the average live birth rate for ivf in 2008 was 34% of all cycles. the results are slightly better than the 20% chance that a reproductively healthy couple has of achieving a pregnancy in a given month and carrying it to term. do insurance plans cover infertility treatment? the services covered by insurance will depend on where you live and the type of insurance plan. fifteen states currently have laws that require insurers to cover or offer to cover at least a portion of infertility diagnosis and treatment. those states are arkansas, california, connecticut, hawaii, illinois, louisiana, maryland, massachusetts, montana, new jersey, new york, ohio, rhode island, texas, and west virginia. however, the existing laws vary greatly in their scope of what might be covered. for more information about specific laws in each of those states, you may contact your state's insurance commissioners office. to learn about pending insurance legislation in your state, you may contact your state representative. whether or not you live in a state with an infertility insurance law, you can choose to consult with your employer's human resources department to determine the exact coverage your plan provides. another resource for determining coverage is infertility insurance advisor, an insurance counseling program for infertile couples. this booklet is available for a small fee from resolve, an infertility patient advocacy and information organization. because the desire to have children and be a parent is fundamental to being human, people should not be denied insurance coverage for medically appropriate treatment for problems of infertility. for more information on infertility: infertility information, a top site providing information and support for infertility. american society for reproductive medicine. call 205 - 978 - 5000. resolve, the national infertility association. call 888 - 623 - 0744. find a infertility specialist in your area. last updated october 12, 2018 at 14:55 pm. compiled using information from the following sources: 1. society for assisted reproductive technology (sart) <url> 2. resolve, the national infertility association <url> 3. ncsl, national conference of state legislature <url> pin 74",

        "text": "how are amish communities organized? amish society is ordered by church district, settlement, and affiliation. amish church and community circles intersect and overlap in numerous ways. when discussing amish communities, you may hear the three terms - district, settlement, and affiliation - used. these terms refer to three distinct ways in which amish society is ordered. amish society is organized in 3 main ways. affiliation refers to amish who adhere to similar guidelines for living, also known as the ordnung. members of a given affiliation can be found in geographically dispersed locations. settlement is the geographical location where a group of amish lives. amish in one settlement may be of different affiliations. church district is the individual congregation where an amish person worships, each led by its own ministry and comprised of around 30 families. affiliation: the term affiliation describes likeminded amish who adhere to similar ordnung or guidelines for living. amish of the same affiliation or order are said to be in fellowship with one another. amish of differing affiliations in big valley, pennsylvania. while all amish adhere to certain tenets such as adult baptism and nonviolence, there are variations in the amish approach to technology, manner of dress, and even spiritual issues. amish tend to fellowship with others in their affiliation and with amish sharing similar levels of technology and outlook. amish not in fellowship with one another will not formally worship with one another and do not exchange ministers for purposes of preaching. an affiliation may be quite conservative in its outlook - nebraska amish - or rather progressive - new order amish. there may be very distinct differences between affiliations which would not be immediately noticeable to outside observers but quite obvious to amish themselves. amish of different affiliations, though exhibiting differences in areas such as technology, may choose to fellowship with one another as in the case of the andy weaver amish of holmes county, ohio, and the lancaster county amish. settlement: settlement describes the geographical location where a group of amish is found - arthur, illinois, or holmes county, ohio - refer to amish settlements. a settlement may be comprised of one arthur or many distinct affiliations such as holmes county, home to new order, old order, swartzentruber, and other distinct affiliations of amish. a settlement may comprise a single church district or many dozens. church district: amish organize themselves in districts, usually consisting of approximately 30 families who all adhere to a common ordnung or set of rules and guidelines for living. rabers almanac provides listings of amish ministers in 1800 church districts. a district is typically headed by a bishop, two or three ministers, and a deacon, each of whom has a distinct role in the church. in some communities, such as lancaster county, one bishop will lead two separate districts. the church district is the spiritual center of amish life. an amish individual attends church with the families in his district, and these tend to be the people he knows best. districts in a settlement may have ordnungs that differ in minor to significant ways - even districts which are geographically adjacent to one another. for further information, see the riddle of amish culture, donald b. kraybill, pp. 13 - 14; an amish paradox: diversity and change in the world's largest old order amish community, charles b. hurst and david l. mcconnell. question on the amish? get answers to 300 questions in 41 categories at the amish faq. you might like: 3 head - scratching amish myths; amish teeth: from dentures to braces; ethridge, tennessee, 1500 amish in the heart of the south; favorites: 10 common amish surnames; are the amish environmentally minded? amish america. get updates via rss; furniture stores; find a business; pennsylvania dutch language; sitemap; view all posts.",

        "text": "mccartney's absence sparks rancor at rock hall. january 22, 1988. robert hilburn, times pop music critic. new york. hopes that the three surviving beatles would stage a minireunion at wednesday night's third annual rock and roll hall of fame induction dinner were dashed by paul mccartney. and that led to some bad vibrations from the beach boys' mike love. moments before the start of the dinner at the waldorf - astoria hotel, a representative for mccartney distributed a statement in the press room that indicated mccartney wouldn't be joining ringo starr and george harrison at the ceremony, which also honored bob dylan, the beach boys, the drifters and the supremes. the reason: long - standing business and legal problems involving the surviving beatles and their former record company, apple. it would have been the trio's first public appearance in america since the beatles' 1966 concert at candlestick park in san francisco. \"i was keen to go to the dinner and pick up my award, but after 20 years, the beatles still have some business differences which i had hoped would have been settled by now,\" mccartney said in the statement. \"unfortunately, they haven't been settled, so i would feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with harrison and starr at a fake reunion.\" the more than 700 people who paid up to $1000 a ticket to attend the black - tie affair were caught by surprise when the beach boys' love took a slap at mccartney and another no - show, the supremes' diana ross. \"i think it is wonderful to be here tonight,\" love said, following the other beach boys at the microphone as they accepted their awards. \"but i also think it is sad that there are other people who aren't here tonight to be honored, and those are the people who passed away,\" love said, referring to the beatles' john lennon, the beach boys' dennis wilson and the supremes' florence ballard. \"those are the obvious ones. but there are also people who chose not to come for other reasons, people like paul mccartney who couldn't be here tonight because he's in a lawsuit with ringo and yoko ono, lennon's widow. that's a bummer, because we're talking about harmony in the world.\" amid sighs of disappointment over the news of mccartney's decision, there was also scattered applause in support of love's remarks. the applause apparently spurred the notoriously outspoken beach boy to further jabs, which generated additional nervous laughter and applause. \"it's also a bummer when ms. ross can't make it.\" on a roll, love made some more sarcastic references to the beatles, bruce springsteen, billy joel and mick jagger during a long, rambling speech. he even suggested that jagger was afraid to be on the same bill as the beach boys. the remarks were so pointed that when he left the stage, there was widespread booing from the audience. dylan, in making his induction acceptance speech a bit later, responded at first humorously, then seriously. \"i'd like to thank mike love for not mentioning me. peace, love and harmony is important indeed, but so is forgiveness.\" a beach boys spokeswoman said thursday that love would have no further comment on his speech. love's criticism of mccartney was not shared - at least publicly - by harrison, starr or ono, who accepted a hall of fame statuette for her late husband. harrison, however, made a playful reference to mccartney as he stood at the podium with starr, ono and lennon's sons, sean, 12, and julian, 24. \"i don't have to say much, because i was always known as the quiet beatle,\" he said. \"it's unfortunate paul's not here, because he was the one who had the speech in his pocket.\" in reflecting on how strange it felt being on stage without lennon, however, harrison also made a poignant reference to mccartney. \"we all loved lennon so much - and we all love paul very much.\" mary wilson, representing the supremes, also sidestepped love's criticism of her former partner. \"it was my wish that ross were here tonight, but we all must recognize that people have to live their lives,\" wilson said. \"there comes a time in a star's life when you have to really assess what is important to you, and i would say that since diana has received so many, many accolades in life that she probably has felt that her marriage and recently born baby is something that's very, very important, and i respect that.\" a spokesman for ross, however, reacted angrily to love's comparing of ross and mccartney. elliot mintz, media consultant for ono and ross, said in an interview after the dinner: \"if his speech was intended to be about harmony, it had totally the opposite effect. it was divisive, judgmental, misguided and at times venomous.\" 1 2 more. seizure led to flo - jo's death. his 104 scores make his case. restaurant review: south beverly grill. brutal murder by teen - age girls adds to britons' shock. comaneci confirms suicide attempt. magazine says.",

        "text": "in downtown la, sealed - off hotel rooms offer peek into the past. a developer plans to turn an abandoned wing of the once - prestigious alexandria hotel into small apartments. the century - old deluxe rooms are a time capsule. october 27, 2012 by roger vincent, los angeles times. developer nick hadim stands inside a storage area next to the alexandria. jay l. clendenin, los angeles. real estate developer nick hadim made a risky climb through an upstairs window of an abandoned building to see what he and his investors had gotten themselves into. downtown's alexandria hotel had long been rumored to be haunted. but instead of ghosts, he found a time capsule. there, in a sealed - off wing of the otherwise bustling complex, he encountered a dusty suite, deserted in some haste in the 1930s. a crumbling bowler hat lay next to a torn armchair. an antique typewriter sat ready for use on the side of a wooden desk. in the bathroom was a cast - iron claw - foot tub, last filled with water during the great depression. photos: alexandria hotel. \"it's freaky,\" said hadim, a culver city entrepreneur with experience renovating old downtown buildings. hadim plans to spend $3 million turning the alexandria's abandoned wing into small apartments, which he hopes to rent at premium rates in what he will call the chelsea building. what his investors bought were century - old deluxe hotel rooms, once part of the alexandria, a stalwart presence at 5th and spring streets since the early 1900s, now a low - priced apartment complex. hadim's group purchased just a small slice of the old hotel building, a wing that was sealed shut on all seven floors in a fit of pique in 1938 and has been seen by few eyes since then, except those of wandering birds and the occasional vandal. what most of the 35 rooms hold is a mystery, because the corridors lack an entrance other than the hallways of the alexandria, which have been walled off for nearly 75 years. the lowest of the building's six hotel - room floors can be accessed from an adjacent roof and has been stripped by scavengers. still, its tall, wide windows, high ceilings and dark wood floors retain their grandeur, even as pigeons flit in and out of the broken windows. the abandoned rooms were part of what was widely considered the city's premier inn of the early 20th century, according to los angeles times archives. young aristocrat winston churchill stayed at the showplace, as did opera star enrico caruso and presidents taft, wilson and theodore roosevelt. but the city moved on. the 500 - room alexandria was eclipsed in status by the elegant los angeles biltmore hotel in 1923. the wing became unreachable because the hotel's owner sealed the halls leading to it with bricks and mortar as a punishment, said lee roddie, daughter of the wing's builder. roddie explained her family's tale of woe to the times in 1967, when the elderly woman was still paying property taxes on her mostly inaccessible building. as the alexandria was being built in 1905, roddie's father, william chick, tore down his livery stable next door at 218 w. 5th st. and went into business with the hotel's developers. chick constructed an addition to the hotel on his property that was a seamless extension of the alexandria, fully accessible from the hotel's corridors. photos: alexandria hotel. stairs or an elevator were an unnecessary expense, he reasoned, and would have eliminated some money - making guest rooms. \"father made a terrible mistake,\" roddie said, looking back on that decision. the hammer fell in the depression. hard times forced the alexandria to close in 1934. three years later, movie producer phil goldstone bought the hotel and reopened it in 1938 to the delight of roddie, who was by then sole owner of the wing. but their relationship quickly soured. one of the tenants in the main part of the hotel moved into one of the two stores on the bottom floor of my wing because mr. goldstone raised his rent, roddie told the times. \"it made mr. goldstone mad. he said he didn't need my wing. he sealed off the corridors to my rooms on each floor, making access impossible. it's been that way ever since.\" tall tales used to circulate about the haunted hotel, she said. one of the most common was that the owner's husband was killed on the titanic and the widow kept it closed in his memory. \"my husband died of flu during world war i,\" roddie said. roddie and subsequent owners were able to rent out only the building's ground - floor retail space, which has a narrow concrete stairway in back leading to a sealed - off portion of the alexandria's former mezzanine. now used for storage, the once - grand mezzanine still has elaborate gilded crown molding and rounded windows adorned with advertising in gold leaf. a tall wooden ladder leads to a hatch in the roof. from there, the lowest level of the building's long - lost hotel can be entered through one room's window. a short hallway bisects the floor and the transom windows of some rooms remain open as they would have been in the days before air conditioning. the decayed wallpaper looks like peeling paint. the hardwood floors are speckled with pigeon guano but remain firm and may be restored with simple sanding, hadim said. 1 2 more. seizure led to flojo's death. his 104 scores make his case. restaurant review. south beverly grill. brutal murder by teen -

        "text": "all collections. finishing processes. smoothing fdm parts. smoothing fdm parts. as processes and materials have advanced, industry has expanded the use of the technology beyond prototyping to manufacturing. written by john cordes. updated over a week ago. overview. the range of additive fabrication applications is extensive and growing. as processes and materials have advanced, industry has expanded the use of the technology beyond prototyping to manufacturing. although the applications are diverse, there is one dilemma they all share: an underlying tradeoff between aesthetic quality and functionality. the additive fabrication technologies with the best surface finishes have been clearly distinguished from those technologies with the greatest strength. virtually any tough, durable, and strong part can be finished to have a smooth, paint - ready surface. however, the cost and time to do so may be prohibitive, or the effects on part accuracy may be unacceptable. as a result, in the past, companies may have elected to use a weaker, less durable alternative to save time, reduce cost, and preserve feature details. finishing prototypes, tooling components, or production parts can be done in several ways, each with varying impact on lead time, expense, and quality. the most common alternative is to sand a part by hand or with power tools. overall, this works well, especially for parts of reasonable size with few features and details. but when the part includes many features, small details, or deep cavities, sanding becomes laborious, time - consuming, and costly. another consideration is that removing material makes dimensional accuracy a variable that changes with each individual that touches the part. between sanding operations, parts may have filler or primer applied. this is a common technique when preparing a part for painting because it will deliver parts with very smooth finishes. fillers and primers also help to preserve dimensional accuracy since depressions are filled before sanding them smooth. but this paint - ready finish comes at a cost. it takes much more time to apply multiple coats of fillers and primers, and more labor to sand between each coat. this increases the lead time and the expense for the part. another method of smoothing parts that are made of thermoplastics is to melt the outer surface with a solvent. parts may have mek or proweld brushed onto their surfaces, or they can be dipped into a bath of the material. the solvent causes the plastic to liquefy, which fills in the low areas on the surface. the solvents have the added benefit of sealing a porous surface. yet there are some drawbacks. small features may be distorted, cavities may not be reached, and drips will leave a visible mark. another consideration is that drying times can be lengthy if the... what industry needs, especially when pursuing direct digital manufacturing (ddm) applications, is a finishing technique that keeps lead times and costs to a minimum while delivering a robust, functional part with high accuracy and crisp feature details. applications. examples of real - world applications of the smoothing process cover the entire spectrum from painted marketing samples to finished goods manufacturing. since launching the smoothing station, usage of fortus systems for a range of applications has expanded. with the smoothing process, companies are extending their use of fdm into applications that demand both functionality and smooth surfaces. applications include: 1. finishing master parts by painting or electroplating. 2. tooling masters. 3. sealing parts for liquid applications. 4. thermoforming molds. 5. investment casting. painting. a leading automobile manufacturer estimates that it takes three days and $70,000 to prepare a prototype front - end grill for painting. over the course of three days, workers apply body filler, sand all surfaces, spray on primer, resand all surfaces, and finish with a top coat of primer. in stark contrast, the same grill is smoothed and ready for paint in less than two hours. total labor for the smoothing process is only one hour, and supplies cost less than $1,000. while a 90 percent savings in time and expense is impressive, the company found that the biggest benefit was in build. to minimize the time to hand - sand a grill, the automotive company would build the fdm part in the same orientation that it is mounted on a car. it would also construct the part with smaller slice thicknesses. smoothing eliminates both of these time - consuming measures. by building the grill on its back with thicker slices, the company reduced build times by more than half. this decreased part cost, accelerated delivery, and increased machine capacity. having more capacity and shorter lead times then resulted in less outsourcing, which further reduced prototype expenses while keeping sensitive, confidential design information within the... a leading manufacturer of children's toys and baby gear estimates that it paints nearly half of all additive fabrication parts that it makes in a year. to prepare these parts for paint, they are sanded, filled, sprayed with a primer coat, and sanded once again. this approach extends lead times, consumes manpower, and adds significant costs to the prototyping operation. in an evaluation, the company compared the hand - finishing approach with the smoothing process for preparation of an infant seat for painting. it discovered that it could reduce lead time and cost by more than 80 percent. while the smoothing process was completed in under two hours for less than $4,000, sanding and priming required six hours of labor and cost more than $25,000. thermoforming. a manufacturer of food packaging has used fdm tools for its thermoforming process when it conducts design validations. the advantage of an fdm tool is that it can be built porous, which allows a vacuum to be drawn through the entire part. this allows the company to use the fdm tools as soon as the build is complete. however, it did not use these tools for marketing samples because the porous surface was too rough. experimentation has demonstrated that the smoothing process allows the fdm mold to be dual - purpose. following the design verification, the fdm mold is smoothed. the glossy finish that results is ideal for the thermoformed marketing samples. with the smoothing process, the company can now thermoform design models and marketing samples in the same day. the one small limitation of the smoothing process is that it seals the surface of the part, which negates an advantage of an fdm thermoforming mold. however, the company discovered that it can simply pierce the skin of the fdm part in strategic locations. since the smoothing process only penetrates 0.010 inch (0.25 mm), technicians can use any sharp - point tool to perforate the mold's surface. electroplating. electroplaters have found that the smoothing process performs two essential functions in one operation. the result is faster delivery, lower expense, and higher quality. prior to the electroplating process, parts must be smoothed and sealed. rough surfaces are visible in the plated part, and porosity allows the electroplating solutions to leech into the interior. the traditional manual processes used to smooth and seal parts add to lead times and direct labor expenses. they also introduce variances in part quality and accuracy. hand - sanding parts to reach a level of smoothness suited for polished metal surfaces is a time - consuming process. it also involves some craftsmanship that can lead to variations in part quality. likewise, sealing parts with primer can result in inconsistencies in the application of the primer and conductive coatings. the alternative is to dip the parts in solvent, but this can damage small details. dipping also requires a long drying cycle of one to two days. in contrast, the smoothing process protects small features and fine details in electroplated parts while preserving dimensional consistency. and it does so while minimizing direct labor and processing time. in most cases, parts are ready for electroplating in under two hours. casting. sand casting and investment casting foundries have implemented fdm to accelerate the pattern - making and tool - making processes. the one remaining hurdle to shorter lead times for high - quality castings has been surface finishing. because the quality of the casting is dependent on the quality of the pattern or tool, time and labor are invested in each fdm part to manually finish the surfaces. for investment casting, hand - finishing is a repetitive process since an fdm pattern is consumed for every metal casting. besides the impact on time and cost, hand - working the patterns makes it difficult to maintain dimensional consistency from part - to - part. the smoothing process addresses all three issues simultaneously. in one batch, the smoothing station can process multiple fdm patterns in under an hour with only a few minutes of direct labor. additionally, the smoothing action is the same across all parts, so there is consistency in the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the parts. sand casting foundries use fdm patterns to produce core boxes, copes, drags, and match plates that pack sand to make the casting tool. foundries will also make these items directly from an fortus system, eliminating the need for patterns. whether it is an fdm pattern or fdm tool, the smoothing process minimizes direct labor and lead time to deliver production sand castings. the advantages of the smoothing process really grow when producing complex sand castings, such as gear housings or steering knuckles. one foundry notes that complex parts may need dozens of sand cores - each made from a different core box - to reproduce internal passages and cavities. hand - finishing a dozen core boxes adds many days and countless labor hours. by substituting the smoothing process, the same work could be completed in a fraction of the time with very little direct labor. the bottom line for the foundry is an increase in production capacity with a reduction in lead time. conclusion. companies are realizing impressive reductions in lead times and expenses when the smoothing station is used to finish and seal fdm parts. independent of complexity and number of features, the smoothing station creates a paint - ready finish in just a few hours, and it needs less than an hour of labor and $1,000 worth of supplies. the smoothing station has essentially automated the fdm additive fabrication finishing process. it eliminates the time, labor, and expense of sanding, filling, and priming parts to achieve a smooth surface finish for production parts, prototype tools, and painted samples. in doing so, the smoothing station has removed any tradeoff between aesthetic quality and product functionality. infant seat. did this answer your question?",

        "text": "asc 805 business combinations: overview. scope of asc 805. intangible assets & resources. when a business acquisition occurs, the accounting is governed by asc 805 business combinations (formerly sfas 141r). asc 805 requires that each asset and liability acquired in a business combination be recorded at fair value (as defined in asc 820) as of the acquisition date, including internally - developed intangible assets of the target company that may not have been previously reflected on the books. for tangible assets such as cash, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses, the process of determining their fair value is relatively straightforward. things get more complicated when dealing with intangible assets, since one cannot simply point to a bank statement or general ledger balance to determine their value as of the acquisition date. it is the process of valuing a company's intangible assets that often requires the assistance of a valuation expert, given the complexity associated with valuing intangibles and the documentation required by audit firms to support the purchase price allocation for an acquisition. one of the first steps in valuing an acquired company's intangible assets is determining what intangibles may be present. we have compiled a list of potential intangible assets for companies to consider, along with a summary of the intangible assets we see recorded most often in practice (found in the intangible assets tab). gone are the days when all of the purchase price in excess of a target company's net tangible assets in an acquisition could be allocated to goodwill; this amount must now first be allocated to specifically identifiable intangible assets, with only the remaining residual balance allocated to. while the valuation of intangible assets in an acquisition is the most notable requirement of asc 805, it reaches into other areas of business combination accounting as well. for instance, asc 805 requires the valuation of earnouts when present in an acquisition, which must be presented at fair value as a liability on the balance sheet. this can make the determination of the purchase price in an acquisition a much more complex process than simply identifying the amount of cash paid at closing. however, when earnouts are contingent on the continued employment of one of the sellers after the transaction, it may be required that these earnout payments be expensed as incurred rather than reflected as part of the purchase price. there are many unique factors such as this that must be considered in business combination accounting (see the scope of asc 805 and resources tabs for more information). given the complexity of asc 805, it is a best practice for companies to get out in front of the accounting for business combinations before their year - end audit begins. companies should discuss acquisitions with their auditors as they occur and determine the level of analysis that will be required to document/support the value of any acquired intangible assets and whether the use of a third - party valuation expert will be necessary. proactively addressing these issues can lead to a much smoother audit process and avoid potential delays that may be encountered otherwise. questions? contact sean saari. first name. last name. email. phone number. message. subscribe to the skoda minotti blog.",

        "text": "letter to bbmp commissioner, march 18, 2009. s srinivasan. our work is to empower citizens, made possible by your donation. click to donate. it would be good if bbmp help centres adopt a standardised approach for calculation, filling of forms and issue of receipts. presently, there is a lot of misunderstanding and failure of supervision by revenue officials at the help centers that are leading to confusion and sufferings for the tax payers - young and old. i had sent a letter to the bbmp commissioner on 9th march which has not been acknowledged as yet. advertisement note: i had earlier pointed out a serious error in the online calculator as it had not taken the multiplying factor of 10 in the uav for car parking area. i have come to know this was corrected by bbmp as per a report in the times of india. following is the text of the letter: deficiencies in property tax matters congratulations to the bbmp team in trying their level best to create a standardised procedure in collecting data and the property tax from every property owner coming under the bruhat bangaluru scheme. i agree that such a massive effort will have several unanswered queries and slip - ups. it is the duty of every property owner to be sincere in declaring and identifying their properties and help bbmp in removing all doubts and rectify the errors in the procedure so that from the next block year onwards it will be very easy to fill the forms and pay up the taxes. after studying the handbook, website information and the various clarifications given by bbmp in the newspapers from time to time, i would like to point out certain deficiencies that need study and correction. the final receipt issued by bbmp after payment of the taxes mentions tax and cess separately. the receipt format needs revision and should have space for khatha number, block year and other data required for ease of computerisation. the application forms need changes in arriving at the figures for entry in the receipts. presently, the tax and cess are added and rebate is applied on the total. instead, the rebate for tax and cess should be separately calculated and added so that the figures required to be shown in the receipt tallies with those in the application form. the built - up area has created a lot of confusion since the figures given in the sale deeds are super built - up area, plinth area, undivided land share, common areas, etc. bbmp should be specific as to what is in their mind when using the word built - up. the factor differs between individual residences and apartment complexes. the problem comes in the usage of these words by different builders and their sale deeds. bbmp has to standardise the terminologies to rectify the anomalies. separate pages or paragraphs can be given in the application form for individual residences and apartments in multi - storey complexes. the online calculator uses different procedure in calculating the taxes. it needs changes in the software to suit the procedure and the entries as used in the application forms in the same sequence and in the receipt format. only standardised terminologies should be used in all publications, notices, formats, computerisation, etc. to avoid confusing interpretations. it is seen that the online calculator is used to print out the tax receipts also without making any corrections pointed out as above. it is also seen that the rounded - of tax figures are not accepted. as in income tax cases, the software for the online calculator should be modified to round off the tax payable so that cheque writing is easy. it is also seen that many of the help centers are not supervised by the revenue officials and the clerical staff do collect money to fill up forms. unauthorised collections are still taking place in many apartment complexes, making a mockery of your appeals. many of the properties are not identifiable in the zonal classifications. efforts should be taken to revise the classifications to include left out areas by the street, locality, nearby prominent feature names, etc. about s srinivasan: 12 articles. srinivasan s is a resident of chikkallasandra.",

        "text": "about biography. jeffrey l marrongelle is a doctor of chiropractic and a certified clinical nutritionist. he has been practicing homotoxicology and nutrition in connection with his practice for 30 years. dr marrongelle has successfully integrated the latest technologies with nutrition, herbal drainage remedies and complex homeopathy with structural modalities to assist his patients with a wide range of conditions. dr marrongelle is a graduate and was a member of the board of trustees for capital university of integrative medicine (cuim) in washington dc and has completed a doctorate of integrative medicine degree. he is a primary researcher in the effects of electromagnetic fields with the human physiology. he is frequently sought after as a consultant, lecturer and speaker on nutrition, integrative medicine and the future of self - care. complete resume. why do people drive halfway across the country to a rural pennsylvania town and spend up to 3 hours in a waiting room to see a doctor that nobody's heard of? his office rarely opens before noon. you won't ever catch him wearing a tie. his consultation fees have been known to make even highly paid athletes and corporate execs skip a heart beat. he only sees patients by referral and those referrals come from some of the biggest names in medicine. he's the first entry under doctor in many little black books. who the heck is he? his name is dr jeffrey marrongelle. he's the founder and director of the bioenergimed metabolic institute in schuylkill haven, pennsylvania. there are few people in the world that can rival his skills as a medical detective and healer. for more than 30 years, dr marrongelle has studied, taught and practiced the art of healing with extraordinary results. during a typical day in his office, you might overhear stories of patients that were diagnosed as terminal and after discovering dr marrongelle are still alive today. you may hear about a mystery illness being discovered and treated, or clients finally finding relief from a condition that controlled their life for years. where other doctors give up, he thrives. he is one of the world's leading experts in heart rate variability, biofeedback, electro - stimulation technology (best), body mechanics and energetic restructuring, athletic assessment and improvement, obscure neurological disorders, traumatic brain injuries (tbi), environmental illness. he has also personally developed and clinically tested dozens of custom - formulated nutritional supplements. none are released or used in his practice until they meet his rigid standard and he can confidently call them the best. his secret is perspective. if you walk into your kitchen one night and see a mouse scurrying under your refrigerator, what do you do? you obviously have a rodent problem that you need to take care of. so you set a mouse trap. but have you really taken care of the problem? sure, that mouse is gone, but chances are there's a hole somewhere around the edges of your house that's allowing the rodents in. you can catch one mouse with a quick fix, but if you don't fix the hole, you're going to see dozens more come back. the same is true for your body. if you discover a symptom one day, you may go to the doctor's office and get a prescription to cover that symptom. but how did you get it in the first place? there's a gap somewhere in your body that's allowing these problems to enter. dr marrongelle's intense study of human physiology and his knack for healing allows him to find those gaps. his unique knowledge and highly specialized equipment give him the perspective to see both how to resolve symptoms and what's causing them. now, the human body is obviously very different than a house. houses don't come with built - in mechanisms to fix their own problems. people do. instead of plugging the holes with prescriptions and other chemical shortcuts, he uses his advanced grasp of biophysics applications for healing to help the body focus on its areas of distress and heal itself. so, he does what? simply put, he discovers and treats the root of health problems using the latest in technology. for example, heart rate variability (hrv) assesses the function of the autonomic nervous system by observing how the beat - to - beat heart rate is controlled. when your autonomic nervous system is out of sync, it compromises your body's ability to efficiently respond to the effects of biological, emotional and environmental stress and the ability to efficiently heal itself. using hrv, he is able to almost immediately discover which way your nervous system is leaning and whether the chosen intervention is having a positive effect on the dysautonomia. bio - impedance body composition analysis, electro - acupuncture assessment are utilized to assist his assessment of your personal physiology. when these unique assessments are coupled with traditional medical diagnostics including blood work, mri, x - rays and ct scans and in - depth case history analysis, provides a train of causality that is supported by multiple biomarkers. once the problems have been discovered, he uses his custom - formulated nutritional supplements, herbal and homeopathic preparations and frequently one or more state - of - the - art energy technologies to assist the autonomic nervous system into better regulation. learn from the best. even if you never see him for a consultation, you still have the opportunity to learn from his vast clinical experience when you subscribe to the bio - energy docs news. it's absolutely free to sign up and you'll get potentially life - saving advice. he covers topics as diverse as: how to take control of your life with personal self - care; how to clean both your environment and your body on a frequent basis with simple and proven methods; how to get more energy and endurance; what kind of pollution is really the biggest threat to your health, a pollutant so closely tied to big industries that the government will never tell you about it; latest discoveries in the self - care revolution; insider information on medical technologies that are transforming the health landscape; and much more information that you simply can not live without.",

        "text": "some biblical roots of the teaching on the assumption of mary. msgr charles pope. august 14, 2013. while the actual event of the assumption of mary in heaven is not recorded in the scriptures, nevertheless there is a biblical basis for the teaching that, considered as a whole, confirms catholic teaching as both fitting and in keeping with biblical principles. let's ponder this feast in three stages: 1. explained to be assumed means to be taken up by god bodily into heaven. as far back as the church can remember, we have celebrated the fact that mary was taken up into heaven. we do not just acknowledge that her soul was taken to heaven, as is the case with all the rest of the faithful who are taken there likely after purgation. rather, mary was taken up soul and body into heaven after her sojourn on this earth was complete. there is no earthly tomb containing her body; neither are there relics of her body to be found among. 2. exemplified the actual event of the assumption is not described in scripture. however, there are assumptions recorded in the scriptures and the concept is thus biblical. it happened to enoch in the old testament. the book of genesis records, \"enoch walked with god, then he was no more, because god took him away\" (gen 5:24). hebrews 11:5 elaborates, \"by faith enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because god had taken him. now, before he was taken, he was attested as having pleased god.\" it also happened to elijah. as he walked with elisha, \"and as they still went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. and he was seen no more\" (2 kings 2:11). some say moses too was taken up, since his grave is not known. as we read in yesterday's first reading at mass, \"he was buried in moab in the valley opposite beth peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is\" (dt 34:6). the text of course does not say his body was taken up, and if it was, it occurred after death and burial. jude 1:9 hints at the fact when it says, \"but even the archangel michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of moses\" (jude 1:9). some further credibility is lent to the view of him being assumed by the fact that he appears alongside elijah in the transfiguration account. some of the church fathers held this view, and there is also a jewish work from the 6th century ad entitled the assumption of moses that represents the tradition of his assumption. but in the end, the assumption of moses is only a view held by some, and it is not officially held by the church. and while it is true that the historical event of the assumption is not recorded in scripture, nor are there historical accounts of the event, there may be one other scriptural account that evidences mary's whereabouts, body and soul. the church presents for our consideration in today's second reading a passage from the book of revelation, wherein john records his sighting of the ark of god. \"then god's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. and there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm. a great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. she was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. she gave birth to a son, a male\" (rev 11:19 - 12:5). the woman is clearly mary, since the child is clearly jesus, though she also likely allegorizes other realities such as israel and mother zion. and where is mary seen? in heaven. now some may argue the text does not necessarily indicate her body is in heaven but may only be referring to her soul. however, the physicality of the description of her is rather strong. some also argue that mary is linked to john's sighting of the ark of the convent, which is seen by john in heaven. he mentions the ark and goes on to describe the woman clothed with the sun (mary), and there is a possibility that he is still describing the ark he sees in heaven. i have written on this elsewhere. see here: mary, the ark of the new covenant. if she is the ark described, that ark is clearly described as being in heaven. so the biblical record, while not recording the event of the assumption, does set forth other assumptions and thus shows that assumption is a biblical concept. further, mary's physical presence in heaven seems hinted at by john, and some would argue that the passage actually attests to her physical presence there. but remember, the church does not rely solely on scripture. in this case, what we celebrate is most fundamentally taught to us by sacred tradition, in that the memory of mary's assumption goes back as long as we can remember. 3. extended the feast of the assumption may be of theological interest to some and may provide for interesting biblical reflection, but eventually the question is bound to come: so what? how does what happened to mary have impact on my life and what does it mean for me? the answer to this question is bound up in nearly every marian doctrine. simply put, what happened to mary in an profound and preliminary way will also happen for us in the end. as mary bore christ into the world, we too bear him there in the holy communion we receive. for now, our souls go to heaven once purified, but our body lie in a tomb. but one day, when the trumpet shall sound on that great gettin' up morning, our bodies will rise and be joined to our soul. for we will all be changed in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. for the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. when the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"death has been swallowed up in victory. where, o death, is your victory? where, o death, is your sting?\" thanks be to god. he gives us the victory through 1 cor 15:51 - 57. so our bodies shall rise, shall be assumed, and joined to our soul. improved model now, an older woman once said to me upon hearing that her body would rise, \"father, if this old body has to rise, i'm hoping for an improved model.\" yes, indeed. me too. i want my hair back, my slender figure, and knees that work. i want to upgrade from a general - issue, late - model version to a luxury model. and god will, in fact, do that. scripture says he will take these lowly bodies of ours and transform them to be like his own glorified body (phil 3:21). but someone may ask, \"how are the dead raised? with what kind of body will they come?\" how foolish! what you sow does not come to life unless it dies. when you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. but god gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. so will it be with the resurrection of the dead. the body that is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable; it is sown in dishonor. 1 cor 15:35 - 49. yes, we shall also be taken up, assumed, and then shall be fulfilled for us the saying of job: \"i know that my redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth. and after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh i will see god. i myself will see him with my own eyes; i and not another.\" job 19:25 - 27. the assumption of our bodies, prefigured by christ in his own power and also in mary by the gift of god, will one day be our gift too. for now, it waits till that great gettin' up morning. until that day, and on that day, fare you well, fare you well. this song is an african - american spiritual and speaks of that great gettin' up morning when our bodies will rise. and if we have been faithful, they will rise to glory. i'm gonna tell you about the coming of the judgement. fare you well. there's a better day a - coming. in that great gettin' up morning, fare you well. oh preacher, fold your bible. for the last souls converted. blow your trumpet, gabriel. lord, how loud shall i blow it? blow it right, calm and easy. do not alarm all my people. tell them to come to the judgement. in that great gettin' up morning, fare you well. do you see them coffins bursting? do you see them folks is rising? do you see the world on fire? do you see the stars a - falling? filed in: homilies, uncategorized. tags: cycle a, cycle b, cycle c, feast days, homilies. comments: 23. trackback url. comments rss feed. candida eittreim says: august 14, 2013 at 2:14:00, \"mary was without blemish or stain. sinless and pure, she was assumed intact. a perfect rose for jesus.\" darwin paul says: december 16, 2013 at 22:21, \"there is no one righteous other than the son of god.\" daniel says: august 14, 2013 at 23:03, \"arise, o lord, into thy rest, thou and the ark of thy strength. ps 132:8.\" kenneth d says: august 15, 2013 at 07:40, \"ave sanctissima, ave purissima, ora pro nobis percatoribus. amen. foolishness of god is wiser than men's wisdom. mother, aid us achieve holiness in this valley of tears. amen, amen.\" kenneth j wolfe says: august 15, 2013 at 09:45, \"beautiful photo of murillo's assumption painting displayed at the hermitage in russia. here is a personal photo of another version which is in a sacristy in mexico. <url> - painting - in - sacristy.html\" heidi keene says: august 15, 2013 at 10:08, \"here's another good one that gets over - looked often. gen 22:3. if christ in the ascension entered the heavenly eden, since his physical body is somewhere and not simply only in heaven, then the inauguration of the new creation could only be completed by the first woman of the new creation joining him in the flesh. when adam says, 'at last, bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh,' he was uttering the first biblical prophesy; he was before the fall a prophet, priest and king, and this is his only prelapsarian statement. so when else could christ have fulfilled this prophecy? christ's fulfilled this prophecy at the entrance of mary.\" richardgtc says: august 15, 2013 at 13:15, \"neat observation.\" darwin paul says: december 16, 2013 at 22:24, \"it is destined for man to die once and then the resurrection. this is what jesus fulfilled in the fleshly body he lived righteously.\" donna l says: august 15, 2013 at 10:50, \"i always thought it was so interesting that there weren't any relics from mary. after all, we know where peter's and paul's are buried. but i can't understand why eusebius didn't write about this tradition of the church. he provides so many details about the apostles' lives and deaths. i wish he had written more about mary's. anyway, it's extremely reassuring to see all the scriptural support for this doctrine. thank you, monsignor. hope you're having a blessed day.\" gerard a mikula says: august 15, 2013 at 11:05",

        "text": "february 20, 2011 by shacker. the compleat guide to digitizing your lp collection. for anyone over 40 (or maybe 30), having a music collection probably means that in addition to racks of cds and ridiculous piles of mp3s, you're also sitting on bookshelves or borrowed milk crates full of vinyl lps. hundreds of pounds of space - consuming, damage - prone vinyl lps. were music you could touch, with glorious full - color 12 - inch album art, meandering liner notes, and the practical involvement of lowering needle to plastic. long - playing records represent an era when music was less disposable; we actually sat down to listen rather than treating music as a backdrop to the rest of life. dragging a rock through vinyl was not some kind of nostalgic love affair with the past; it was just the way things were. the cost of admission was pops and scratches, warped discs, having to get up in the middle of an album to flip the disc, cleaning the grooves from time to time, and getting hernias every time you moved to a new apartment. we loved our vinyl despite - and because of - its warts, but we also didn't hesitate to go digital when the time came, first with cds and then with mp3s and other file - based formats. we complained that cds lacked the warmth of vinyl, but cd technology got better over time. we complained that the typical mp3 was encoded at bitrates too low to do justice to the music, but we learned to encode at higher resolutions or to use uncompressed / lossless formats. eventually, most of us gave in to temptation and started listening only or mostly to files stored on a computer. i personally held onto around 700 records made before the 90s, in addition to a few boxes of records my parents left in my care. most of my cd purchases from the 90s and 00s had been ripped long ago, but the lps were locked in limbo; wasn't listening to them but couldn't bear to let go either. in 2011, i finally decided it was time to hunker down and digitize the stacks, to unforget all those excellent records. digitizing lps has almost nothing in common with ripping cds. it's a slow process and a lot of work. but it can be incredibly rewarding, and going through the process puts you back in touch with music the way it used to be played; i.e., it's a great nostalgia trip. in this guide, i'll cover the process of prepping your gear, cleaning your records, and capturing as much of the essence of those old lps as possible, so you can enjoy them in the context of your digital life. setting up so you want to digitize your lp collection? that's awesome, but slow down, cowboy; this isn't going to happen overnight. when you rip a cd, the whole process is pretty much automatic; stick it in, click go, and you're done in minutes (my imac's optical drive rips at around 16x). the metadata (album title, artist, track names, recording year, and album art) are often retrieved automatically, and you never give a thought to dealing with surface noise. but when you square off with a stack of lps, you find out quick that you've got some hurdles to clear. i was process a long one. it's going to take a while to get your gear in order; you've got several decisions to make, and each lp you rip is going to take actual time. fortunately, once you get a groove on, things flow pretty smoothly. you just have to forget that you've been spoiled by the ease of ripping cds, change mental gears back to analog mode, and look forward to getting hands - on with your music again. here's the general roadmap; i'll go into each of these separately below: - tune your table - make the connection - clean your vinyl - pick the right software - decide what to rip and what to toss and what to repurchase - pick an output format - establish a workflow - deal with noise - export tracks tune your table and cartridge because of the time involved, you want to go through this process exactly once. if you're going to do this thing, do it right. you need to think now about a listening picture bigger than your iphone and earbuds, bigger than your desktop computer speakers. the ultimate goal is that you can play the final result through the best amp and speakers you can find, and it'll be indistinguishable from the original (or as close to it as possible). in fact, it may even be better if you filter out pops and scratches carefully. who knows what kind of home stereo you're going to have 10 or 30 years from now? think long - term. so if the process is so time - consuming, why not just repurchase everything? if you're sitting on a lot of lps, buying a new digital copy of every album is going to be expensive, even though a lot of older lps are available at emusic.com and mp3.amazon.com for $5 - 7. sure, your time may be worth more than what it takes to digitize everything yourself, but not everything needs to be an roi - time - is - money calculation, right? if you haven't thought much about your turntable for two decades, take time out to make sure it's in top condition before beginning. it makes no sense to spend dozens or hundreds of hours digitizing if the audio quality is going to be diminished for want of a new needle or because your cartridge hums or your turntable transmits motor noise. think of yourself as an archivist creating a collection you'll be proud to pass down to your children. i was pretty happy with my old pioneer pla35, built solid and totally reliable, but i had forgotten how long it had been since i'd replaced the cartridge and needle. contacted jim at needle doctor and told him i wanted the best setup he could recommend for a benjamin or less. he suggested the ortofon m2 red, and i went for it. to blow your own mind, surf around the phono cartridges section of that site to see what you can get for 15 large (yes, 15k). to be sure i'd made a good decision, i digitized the same album both before and after installing the ortofon, and the difference in tonal range and responsiveness was very audible; a new cartridge was a worthwhile investment. if you're not sure whether your turntable is up to snuff, take it to a qualified audio shop and ask their opinion. you might want to have them do an alignment and lubrication, or let them talk you into a new turntable. hooking up the turntable - computer connection traditional turntables output audio at a level lower than standard line - level. in other words, you can't just plug a turntable's rca cables into your computer and expect it to work. you'll need either a dedicated phono preamp or a turntable with a built - in line stage or usb jack. there are a lot of turntables on the market with built - in usb connections, many of them specifically designed for digitizing old collections. but many of them are cheap pieces of lightweight junk and just not worth it, especially the inexpensive models. in most cases, you'll be better off with a well - designed traditional table and outboard analog - digital converter (adc). there are a dozen or so usb phono preamps available on amazon, ranging from $50 - 1200. my darling wife got me the nad pp3 for christmas around 200 (but no longer available). since it has both usb and rca outputs, i'll still be able to use it in the home stereo for standard lp playback once the digitization process is complete, though it'll be connected to my computer for the foreseeable future. honestly, i can't tell you what to look for in a usb adc - preamp. in general, you get what you pay for. the cheapest one of anything is almost never the right decision, but the really high - end audio stuff works in a realm of subsonic quality differences that my ears simply can't hear. once connected to my imac, i went to the system's sound preferences panel and selected the nad as the input. i did have to reboot the machine before it was recognized (surprisingly). after that, output from the turntable was available to all the audio capture software i tested. make sure the turntable is resting on a solid desk and is not overly sensitive to footsteps in the room; you don't want perceptible warbling in the audio when walking nearby. if you have kids, make sure they know to walk softly when daddy's busy ripping. you don't want to find out that some of your recordings were marred by vibrations months later, after you've finished the process and ditched some of your lps. if you're in a room with a bouncy floor, consider setting up your digistation in another room, maybe with a laptop dedicated to the process. cleaning your vinyl dust & noise the quality of my vinyl collection spans the gamut from old garage sale finds and hand - me - downs to impeccable 180 - gram vinyl from mosaic and everything in between. most records that have been in my personal care have been sleeved and played with the cover down all their lives, and so have fairly minimal dust. nonetheless, virtually all of my records turned up some dust in the cleaning process. since you're shooting for archival quality here, you want that stuff out of the grooves before encoding. in addition, depending on your environment, your records probably have collected a static electrical charge that can affect the quality of the final output. dak has a great page full of electron microscope photographs showing lp surfaces before and after cleaning with their system. if you don't think your records are dusty or that dust and static can affect recording quality, give it a read. dust in record grooves as seen with an electron microscope. check the dak page for more examples. there are a number of vinyl cleaning systems out there, from simple brushes to carbon microfibers to full - on record vacuuming systems. i wanted to clean but wasn't going to get all mad scientist about it. found my old discwasher brush from the 70s still in amazingly good shape after all this time, but the fluid bottle was dry. using fluid is important, not just for cleaning purposes but also to dampen or remove residual static charge. a bit of searching turned up dozens of homebrew fluid recipes, and i settled on this one: - 3 parts distilled water (triple distilled, deionized) - 1 part isopropyl alcohol (91% lab grade) - a few drops of photographic wetting agent if possible (triton x - 100, triton x - 110, or triton x - 115 or monolan 2000; not kodak photoflo, which is reputed to leave a residue, though used by some). recommended is 1 - 2 drops per gallon or 2 - 3 drops per litre, though some use up to 8 drops per litre. if you add too much, the fluid gets sudsy on the record. not having easy access to photoflo or its cousins, i substituted a few drops of windshield wiper fluid as recommended at another site. sounds strange, but because the dilution is so great, figured a micro - amount of what is essentially windex - soap couldn't hurt. because i had so many records to do, i made almost a quart of the stuff in advance, which i transfer to the little discwasher squirt bottle as necessary. before recording each side, i squirt two lines of fluid onto the leading edge of the brush and do a slow, steady roll from wet side to dry side. results have been great, and i've pulled visible amounts of dust out of virtually every lp side i've cleaned. everything you can do to extract all the audio goodness possible out of your lps is worth doing within reason. don't skip the cleaning process. pick the right digitizing software technically, you could use any audio software capable of digitizing two - track audio and outputting to mp3 or other formats. but there's a heck of a lot more to the process than capturing audio. digitizing lps is an entire workflow, which involves: - capturing - finding track boundariessplitting tracks - looking up metadata (album title, artist, year, genre, individual track titles, album art) - cleaning up clicks and scratches - cleaning up other noise (hum)",

        "text": "range report: springfield armory emp 4 by dave dolbee, published on may 19, 2016 in firearms range reports. i know there are a lot of fans of the 9mm, particularly after the fbi switched back to the 9mm and a ton of police departments followed suit. on the other hand, the.45 acp has its followers, led by the champions of the 1911. the solution? how about a purpose - built 1911 for the 9mm? it's sacrilege to some and perfection to others, but how it performs is all that really counts. the springfield armory emp 4 pistol is a winner and worthy of trusting your life to. the emp is not a new line for springfield. in fact, springfield launched the enhanced micro pistol (emp) about a decade ago. the intent was to offer a subcompact 9mm in a 1911 configuration. it was the perfect blend of caliber and the 1911 platform in a concealable package, thanks to the 3 - inch barrel. the emp was the perfect blend not because two popular elements were brought together, but rather because the emp was built from the ground up to be a 9mm, unlike many 1911.45 designs that are merely converted to accommodate a smaller caliber. to do this, engineers had... as was true with cell phones, tablets, and other technologies, devices keep getting smaller and smaller until they become too small to be useful for many. pocket pistols suffered from this to a degree, although there are a few pocket or micro pistols that i regularly employ as a bug (back - up gun). for me, the key is as a back - up. to ever need a defensive pistol means things have to have gone very wrong. to need a back - up to a defensive pistol means things have gone horribly wrong. that being said, bugs have their place and i... the dual - magazine holder is handy on the range or during minor competitions. enter springfield's new for 2016 emp 4. smaller than a full - frame 5 - inch 1911, but more controllable and accurate than a 3 - inch model. and because it is chambered for the 9mm, the emp 4 also enjoys a capacity advantage. speaking of capacity, in addition to the 4 - inch barrel, the emp 4's grip has been extended by.5 - inch. this provides just enough length to get all of your (my, anyway) fingers on the grip, plus it adds a round, giving the emp 4 a 10 + 1 capacity. all totaled, the emp offers a familiar manual of arms and a fine balance. the details as would be expected for a pistol of this size, the emp 4 is a single - stack, single - action, semi - auto pistol. the design is pure john browning - inspired, right down to the linked - barrel design. the slide is constructed from stainless steel, while the frame cuts the needed weight to make it a viable carry option by utilizing a matte - black, hard - anodized, lightweight aluminum frame. the result is a sleek and stylish two - tone finish. target acquisition is quick and sight alignment sure, thanks to the low - profile, dovetailed novak - style rear sight featuring dual white dots. the front sight is an orange fiber - optic - infused blade that is well placed for durability. the sight placement makes the most of the sight radius for increased accuracy potential. the emp comes standard with a lockable carry case, three 10 - round magazines, paddle holster, dual - magazine pouch, cleaning brush, rear - sight tool, and cable lock. the emp 4 features a 4 - inch stainless - steel match - grade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp. there isn't a tactile loaded - chamber indicator, but the top of the chamber has a small witness hole that serves as a visual indicator. the barrel is fitted at the muzzle with a removable barrel bushing. the recoil assembly utilizes a full - length steel guide rod, which supports a single flat - wire spring held in place by a reverse spring plug. the aluminum frame follows traditional lines, so it does not have an accessory rail. the trigger consists of a long, skeletonized aluminum match - grade trigger with a serrated face and broke cleanly at 5 pounds, 3 ounces. the front strap of the grip frame features springfield's posilok (reverse - cone), essentially a cross between dimpling and checkering that provides a solid hand purchase without requiring a flesh donation every time you fire it. adding to the posilok's grip enhancement are the thinline cocobolo wood grip panels that also feature a diamond - pattern checkering. the frame - mounted controls, including the slide stop, magazine release, hammer, and grip safety, are all constructed of matte - black 4140 - carbon steel. the thumb safety is designed to be low - profile and ambidextrous for concealed carry. the magazine release button is textured and otherwise standard fare. from the back, the emp 4 utilizes an extended beavertail grip safety with memory bump to enhance grip consistency. the emp 4 comes standard with three 10 - round blued - steel magazines that are manufactured by mecgar in italy and feature a metallic follower and slam pad polymer base plate. it also has a quality hard case. at 10 yards, the emp 4 outshot the author regularly, shooting groups such as these. overall, the fit and finish on the emp was beyond excellent. in fact, it borders custom - grade. on the range concealed carry may lead to last - line - of - defense, so many prefer self - defense loads rated as p. i am normally hesitant to shoot these from a compact pistol, so i started with a variety of loads, ranging from range ammo such as winchester white box and worked through 115, 124, and finally 147 - grain loads. the emp's balance, feel, and textured grip left little doubt when i grabbed the first of the p loads. the hotter the load, the more you are going to feel the snap of the recoil with any pistol, and the more wear you are going to... the springfield armory emp 4 pistol is a winner and worthy of trusting your life to. it is accurate enough to confidently defend yourself at the outer limits of self - defense ranges, but still small and sleek enough to comfortably conceal and carry. best of all, for a fan of the 9mm such as myself, you can afford plenty of ammunition, which will lead to longer and more frequent range sessions. however, for those looking for something that pushes a bigger pea... the emp 4 will soon be offered in.40 sw. the look and, more importantly, feel of the emp 4 is all 1911, with excellent balance and controls. specifications manufacturer: springfield armory model: emp 4 (pi9211lp) action: single -

        "text": "aug. 12. first spin: 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye and dodge challenger rt scat pack. comments written by rick cotta in coupes, dodge, engines, fastest, first spin, new review, sportyperformance cars. 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat widebody (left) and rt scat pack widebody. you had to figure this was coming. after setting the record books ablaze last year with the dodge challenger srt demon and keeping its promise that it would be a one - year - only model, dodge unveiled a more streetable version of much the same car for 2019. plus, it carried over some of the demon's drag - racing technology to a more budget - priced model aimed at, well, drag racing. certainly, there's an allure to an 800 - horsepower car that can do the 1/4 - mile in under 10 seconds, but the demon not only sacrificed some streetability to achieve those numbers, but it cost nearly $90,000 and was hard to get even for that. so dodge followed it up with a challenger sporting nearly the same power but with more of an everyday focus and a much lower price. although challengers aimed at such had long been strong performers, dodge really upped the ante for 2015 with the debut of the srt hellcat, which made great waves at the time with its 707 - horsepower supercharged engine. and though the model continued for 2018, it was somewhat overshadowed, at least in terms of press coverage, by the demon. but not only does the hellcat return for 2019 with 10 more horsepower (now 717), its price has been dropped by about $5,000 to start at $58,650 ($61,745 after destination and gas - guzzler tax), and it's offered with either a 6 - speed manual transmission or 8 - speed automatic. furthermore, it's joined by a redeye variant carrying an only slightly detuned version of the demon's engine, rated at 797 horsepower, which comes in at $11 grand more. both models get a new dual - snorkel hood reminiscent of those offered on the original early - 70s challengers, and both are available in widebody form that adds a sport suspension and fender flares covering wider wheels and tires, a combination said to cut lap times and provide a bit more traction during acceleration. both bee fender badges now face forward on the 2019 dodge challenger rt scat packs. but if your tastes run more to under - $50 - grand machines, dodge has you covered. next step down the line is the rt scat pack, and there's now more than one. the base model starts at $38,995 ($40,390 with destination, an extra $1,000 with the manual transmissions gas - guzzler tax) and features a 485 - horsepower 6.4 - liter hemi v8 (392 cubic inches for you old school sorts), offered with either a 6 - speed manual or 8 - speed automatic transmission. it's also available in widebody form with wider wheels and tires, fender flares, stiffer adaptivedamping suspension, integrated front splitter below the bumper, and a rear spoiler from the hellcat model, all for an extra $6,000. but added for 2019 is a new rt scat pack 1320 model, an upgrade that costs $3,995 that's specifically intended for grassroots drag racers. 2019 dodge challenger rt scat pack 1320 angry bee fender badge. the name plays off the fact that there's 1,320 feet in a 1/4 - mile. it comes with a host of features, many previously fitted to the likewise drag - oriented demon, including nexen 20 - inch drag radials, adaptive dampening suspension with drag mode, transbrake, torque reserve, and heavy - duty half shafts. it also gets unique angry bee badges, similar to the returning bee badges found on other scat pack models. the 1320 comes only in narrow body form for better high - speed aerodynamics with the 8 - speed automatic. furthermore, it comes standard with just a driver seat, which dodge says cuts 114 lbs off the total, though a front passenger seat and rear seat can be added for $1 each, as was the case with the demon. dodge claims these modifications cut about 3 seconds from both the 0 - 60 and 1/4 - mile times. standard interior configuration of the 2019 dodge challenger rt scat pack 1320 has drivers seat only to help reduce weight by approximately 114 pounds, front passenger seat and rear seat are available individually as $1 options. future collectibles: 2017 - 2018 chevrolet camaro zl1. the base model rt scat pack is an all - around performer with the 6.4 - liter v8 providing strong linear power. we drove both manual and automatic - transmission versions of widebody variants, and both impressed; the manual has a slick shifter and easy - to - modulate clutch, while the automatic kicked down quickly when the throttle was stabbed at speed for great passing response. from there, one can fork to either the acceleration or handling branch of the performance spectrum. the 1320 is aimed at providing optimal off - the - line grip and acceleration for drag racing, while the widebody versions lean toward higher cornering capability. indeed, we drove the widebodys on a racetrack (club motorsports in beautiful tamworth, nh), and found the car to be very grippy and balanced at speed. yet it also rode quite comfortably on the ride up there, so these are very capable yet livable performance vehicles with enough passenger and cargo space and available amenities to make them suitable for everyday. that also holds for the hellcat redeye widebodys we drove, though their extra 312 horsepower and the extra weight needed to produce it makes for a decidedly more exciting experience in more ways than one. although shrunk from 6.4 to 6.2 liters, the hellcat's engine adds a supercharger that boosts power in all speed ranges, and, unlike a turbocharger, delivers it instantly and in very linear fashion. but that means an engine that was very strong before now delivers brutal power at the touch of the throttle, and particularly if you choose to turn off the various traction - aiding nannies, that can lead you into some dicey situations. indeed, stories abound of hellcats being wrecked during their first day of ownership by people who didn't respect what 700 horses can do and how quickly they can. 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye fender badge. what all this means on the racetrack and curvy roads is that the hellcat redeye widebodys are touchier than the scat packs, partly because they carry more weight over their front wheels (added largely by the supercharger and its associated plumbing), while also being able to apply more power to the rears. that means corners have to be approached a bit more slowly and exited more carefully, as simply flooring the throttle if the front wheels aren't straight will send the back ones sideways in a not - so - graceful pirouette, something several black curvy lines on corner exits illustrated. but entering the... speaking of horsepower, it's simply amazing that $60 grand will buy you 717 worth, another $11 grand bringing 797. but for most folks, paring the ante down by $20,000 still nets you 485, and on the street, that should be plenty enough for anyone. which isn't to say i don't desperately want a redeye. 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye widebody, the quickest of the quick. check out our sportyperformance car best buys. follow rick on twitter. 2019 dodge challenger hellcat redeye. written by rick cotta on august 12, 2018, on august 13, 2018.",

        "text": "home growing: fence - friendly vines, dos and don'ts growing: fence - friendly vines, dos and don'ts posted on july 17, 2017 has your fence already been damaged by vegetation? are you in the market for a new one? if you live near west chester, pa, and the delaware valley, you're in luck. request a quote for professional fence installation. a structure covered in vines is one of the most classic and beautiful features you can add to your backyard. vines climbing a fence not only enhance aesthetic value but make your yard more private. unfortunately, vines can be as destructive as they are beautiful. they're resourceful plants that crawl up structures in order to soak up as much sun as they can, and sometimes they hold on tight and bring the structure down. you need to make sure your fence is suitable for vines and also that you've chosen a vine that won't cause damage. so, if your dreams, dos and don'ts to consider before growing vines on your backyard fence. vines that aren't fence - friendly the types of vines that are most likely to be unfriendly to your fence and your outdoor living space are fast - growing, woody vines and invasive species of vines. though many of these are beautiful, such as hydrangea or english ivy, they can destroy your fence and shouldn't even come near it. woody vines some woody vines are favorites of gardeners for good reason. many of them, like wisteria or trumpet vine, bloom with bright, fragrant flowers that attract hummingbirds or butterflies. however, when these vines begin to spread over your wooden fence's surface, they hold excess moisture against the wood. this opens the door for rot, as well as fungus, bugs, and other hazards that can wreak havoc on your fence. the wood part of the woody vines' anatomy can also cause a problem; the vines' strong wooden roots can get between the slats of a wooden fence or into existing cracks. invasive species many a hapless homeowner has introduced a beautiful vine to their fence, and a short time later, they ended up fighting an ongoing war with a vine that turned out to be a member of an invasive species. invasive species of vines are often related to native species, like american bittersweets' relative, oriental bittersweet. these unwelcome cousins of naturally - occurring vines have been known to overtake entire geographic regions, choking out ecosystems and individual gardens alike. invasive species like chocolate vine, english ivy, wintercreeper, and japanese honeysuckle pose a hazard not only to the environment but to the appearance of your. all of the problems that come with growing woody vines on your fence - the moisture and accompanying structural damage - are compounded by invasive species' tendencies to grow rapidly on every inch of available space. this includes your fence, lawn, other plants and trees, and even your house if left completely unchecked. once they take hold of your yard, it's likely that the only way to get rid of an invasive species is with a series of controlled burns and applications of vine - killing chemicals, both of which are likely to damage to the beloved plants and trees you actually want to. fence - friendly vines the type of fence you own determines the type of vine you can safely grow on it. even the gentlest vines hold moisture against the parts of your wooden fence they touch. however, aluminum and vinyl fences respond well to most types of vines since they are more durable and less vulnerable to environmental damage than wooden fences. for wooden fences if you have a wooden fence, most species of vines are likely to be treacherous to your fence's longevity. the rotting, cracking, twisting, and other structural damage that vines can cause to your wooden fence mean that most species should be kept away. the safest vines for wooden fences are annual, herbaceous, non - woody vines. these vines' stems can wrap around your wooden fence but won't cause the types of structural damage that woody vines will. you can guide these vines to grow around fence posts or along your fence's upper support beams, which will provide them with plenty of light while keeping them away from your fence's more vulnerable slats. though they should be removed at the end of the growing season, annual vines like morning glory, moonflower, sweet pea, and climbing nasturtium all work well with wooden fences. these plants are airier than most woody vines, which minimizes any moisture trapped between the plant and the fence. these vines grow readily from seed and can reach lengths of 10 to 15 feet at the peak of the season. they do not provide much privacy, but they do produce flowers that are vibrant in color and sweet in fragrance, brightening up your summer garden and attracting butterflies and birds. gardeners who like to vary their planting from year to year will enjoy the opportunity to plant new herbaceous vines each growing season. for vinyl fences vinyl fences, which are made of hardy, weather - resistant material, can withstand almost anything, so the structural concerns that wooden fence owners have about growing vines on their fences mostly do not apply to vinyl fences. because of their durability, vinyl fences are ideal for homeowners who want their climbing vines to enhance the privacy of their spaces. coral honeysuckle or clematis are perennial vines that climb vinyl fences readily. these plants provide a lot of coverage in a short period of time, and they can usually span the height of your fence within a single growing season. though even the strong - man - type woody vines will have little structural effect on your vinyl fence, the plant can still trap moisture against your fence, and with moisture comes a whole host of organisms from algae to bugs. thankfully, algae growth on your vinyl fence is no big deal. vinyl is a non - porous surface that does not permit staining, making it easy to clean your vinyl fence. bugs, on the other hand, could pose a problem. the moisture, delicious plant matter, and tough structure of a bushy vine may seem like a courteous invitation for bugs looking to homestead, placing the other members of your garden in danger. make sure to check on what bugs, if any, are fans of your chosen vine and take the proper steps against bug infestation to keep the rest of your outdoor space safe. for aluminum fences aluminum fences are perhaps the most readily - beautified of all fences. their durability and open - lattice framework provide an excellent foundation for a living fence. wisteria, climbing hydrangea, rambling roses, and other heavy, strong, woody vines that might overwhelm other fences are no match for aluminum, which withstands moisture and resists rust. even grapevines grow enthusiastically on aluminum fences. these plants can provide full coverage within a few growing seasons, adding intense color and aroma to your space. the thorny stalks of some vines, like bougainvillea, might even further discourage intruders. quick tips for growing vines visit a plant nursery. taking cuttings of random, pretty vines from wooded areas may leave you quickly rueing your decision and even your very existence if the vines turn out to be invasive. plant nurseries do not frequently cultivate invasive species since they're often banned from sale by state governments. however, even vines not considered invasive can overwhelm you and your garden. nursery staff can provide you with a wealth of information about how you can ensure your chosen vine stays under control. your vines have needs too. carefully research your vines' sunlight, space, and soil requirements. while some vines are relatively low - maintenance, it's often said that some vines sleep, then creep, then leap - an apt descriptor of how it may take several growing seasons of work to help your vine reach its fullest potential. consider your alternatives. if you have a wooden fence but are dead - set on filling your garden with climbing hydrangea or wisteria, look into other methods of introducing these plants into your space without destroying your fence. arbors and trellises often provide a good structure for flowering vines to cling to and allow you to keep your vines' growth in check. strategically placing these structures can also help you enhance privacy. many people place a series of posts a few feet inside their fence line and a string, wire, or other supports between each post, then guide their vines along these wires. doing so. categories: fences",

producing organisms and study their distribution. they also study the ways that the organisms enter the bodies of humans and animals, establish themselves, and cause disease. immunologists, for example, study the body's defensive responses to microorganisms. other medical microbiologists study the effects of antibiotics on bacteria. some are concerned with the role of viruses in cancer. others help to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease. microbiologists are also employed in the related field of public health. they work to combat problems such as outbreaks of epidemics, food poisoning, and the pollution of air and water. for example, public health microbiologists test blood samples sent in by physicians to see whether patients have a communicable disease. they also test drinking water, milk supplies, and other substances that can affect the health of the general public. other fields in which microbiologists work include agriculture, marine microbiology, and industry. agricultural microbiologists study the microorganisms found in soil and their effects on plant growth. marine microbiologists seek ways to control the growth of harmful bacteria in oceans and rivers. industrial microbiologists work in a variety of industries, including food processing, chemicals, and drugs. they may work to control the activities of microorganisms in such processes as the tanning of leather and the fermentation of wine. education and training requirements. you generally need a doctoral degree to become a microbiologist. you can major in microbiology or any of the other biological sciences as an undergraduate. although those who have bachelor's degrees can find jobs in the field, they are technicians, and their opportunities for advancement are limited. they are usually assigned such tasks as doing diagnostic or quality control testing in laboratories or in industry. those who have earned master's degrees in microbiology or in related fields such as bacteriology are qualified for many jobs in industry, teaching, and applied research. you need a doctoral degree to obtain most teaching. a combination of academic courses and laboratory experience is required for a clinical laboratory license, which is a prerequisite for admission to the certification examinations for some state departments of health. many employers encourage and assist microbiologists who want to further their education in this field. in order to keep up with new findings in their field, microbiologists must continue studying throughout their careers. getting the job. your college instructors or placement office may be able to help you find a job in the field of microbiology. some companies send recruiters to college job fairs. you may find job openings in newspaper classifieds, job banks on the internet, or professional journals. you can also apply directly to colleges and universities, medical centers, private firms, and government agencies that hire microbiologists. you may need to pass a civil service examination to get a government job. advancement possibilities and employment outlook. there are many possible avenues of advancement for microbiologists, especially for those with a doctoral degree. microbiologists can become directors of research in medical centers, private firms, or government agencies. those who hold a teaching and research position in a university can advance to the rank of full professor. they can also make significant discoveries in their research and gain the recognition of other microbiologists. many scientists consider this to be the highest form of advancement. the number of job opportunities for microbiologists will increase at a rate as fast as the average for all occupations through the year 2014. however, the federal government has recently increased its budget and increased the number of grants awarded to researchers. at the same time, the number of advanced degrees awarded has continued to increase. as a result, there will be considerable competition for research positions. colleges and universities will add only a few positions each year. nonetheless, increased public awareness in preserving the environment, providing sanitary food production and storage, and finding cures for such diseases as aids. opportunities for those with bachelor's or master's degrees in microbiology are expected to be better than the opportunities for those with doctoral degrees. these workers can fill jobs in science - related sales and marketing and can take on technician roles. some can become high school teachers. working conditions. working conditions for microbiologists vary. most spend at least part of their time in clean, well - lighted laboratories. some microbiologists have to collect samples of soil, seawater, and other substances that contain microorganisms. some microbiologists spend part of their time in classrooms and offices. the workweek for many microbiologists in medical centers and private industry is generally forty hours. those who work in universities and other research centers may have more flexible hours, but their workweeks generally total more than forty hours. some overtime or shift work may be necessary when a project must be completed or when an experiment must be done. microbiologists must take precautions to prevent specimens from being contaminated and to keep harmful microorganisms from reproducing uncontrollably. they should have skill in scientific experimentation and mathematics and be willing to do the precise, detailed work required in microbiology. microbiologists should be able to work either independently or as part of a team. they must be able to keep careful records and to communicate their ideas and findings to others. where to go for more information. american institute of biological sciences, 1444 i st nw, ste 200, washington, dc 20005; 202 -

related work outside of the classroom. an equivalent amount of work is expected in lab, studio, independent study, and online courses. the academic year typically consists of two semesters that are 15 weeks, including a one - week exam period and a five - week winter session. 414. in a 15 - week term, one lecture, taught seminar, discussion, or online taken credit hour represents 1 hour per week of scheduled class/seminar time and two hours of student preparation time outside of class. a lecture, seminar, or online course awarded three credit hours represents 45 hours of class time and at least 90 hours of student preparation time over the term. summer, winter, and online program terms are typically less than 15 weeks but adhere to the. one 15 - week laboratory credit hour represents one hour per week of lecture or discussion time plus 12 hours per week of scheduled, supervised, or independent laboratory work and two hours of student preparation time. one credit hour for 15 weeks of visual or performing arts studio, supervised student teaching, supervised clinical rounds, field work, independent study, etc. represents 3 - 4 hours per week of supervised and/or independent practice. this in turn represents between 45 and 60 hours of work per 15 - week semester. calculation of credit hours. calculation of credit hours at the university of delaware are consistent with the following us department of education's definition of a credit hour. these guidelines are also in compliance with policies set forth by the middle states commission on higher education. credit hour. except as provided in 34 cfr 668.8(k) and (l), a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than. one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out - of - class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or. at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph 1 of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. the faculty senate has a yearly course approval process. the approval process includes the course detail, term, credit which must be assigned to each proposed or revised course. credits are assigned in accordance with the above us department of education's definition of a credit hour. approved courses are sent to the office of the university registrar for inclusion in the ud academic catalog. the registrar's office reviews the class schedules prior to the start of each semester to ensure that all classes are scheduled for the minimum number of minutes corresponding to the credits assigned. what year are you? a student's year (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) is based on the number of earned credit hours at the time of admission. students with 27 or fewer credits earned toward the degree will be classified as freshmen. those with 28 to 59 credits will be classified as sophomores. those with 60 to 89 credits will be classified as juniors, and those with 90 or more credits will be classified as seniors. your advisor can help you plan which courses to take each semester so that you can graduate in a timely manner. take on the right course load. full - time undergraduates. students who are enrolled for 12 credit hours or more during the fall or spring semesters are considered full - time, although 15 credit hours is a normal load. students who are enrolled for 6 credit hours or more during the winter or summer sessions are considered full - time. a normal schedule consists of four or five major courses, subject to the following credit limitations. for freshmen, a normal load should not exceed 17 credits, excluding skil - mod, military science, and activity courses in music and physical education. a reduced schedule of four academic courses plus skil - mod may be suggested for some freshmen by faculty advisors. for upperclass students not on probation, a normal load should not exceed 18 credits unless prescribed by the curriculum. an additional fee at the per - credit - hour rate applies to each credit in excess of 17. students on academic probation may be enrolled in a maximum of 14 credits. in determining course load for university purposes, registration as an auditor or pass - fail is included. zero - level courses (eg math 010) also determine course load, although they do not count toward credit for graduation. part - time undergraduates. any student registered or enrolled for fewer than 12 credits during the fall or spring semesters is classified as a part - time student. part - time students admitted to the university's undergraduate division are also considered degree candidates. all other students attending on a part - time basis are classified as professional and continuing studies (cend) students (ie not pursuing a formal degree). for purposes of determining course load, registration as an auditor or pass - fail is included. overload. the assistant dean's office of the student's college may approve a course and credit load greater than those defined above if the student has a cumulative grade - point index of at least 2.5 and an index of at least 3.0 for the preceding semester. students are never allowed to register for more than 22 credits, even if some courses are completed on a pass - fail or auditor basis. additional fees must be paid when registering for more than 17 credits. special note. the definitions of full and part - time stated above are those generally used by the university. other organizations or agencies may use different definitions. determinations of full or part - time status for other purposes, such as federal financial aid eligibility, for athletic participation under ncaa rules, scholarship eligibility, etc. are made using the guidelines of the governing organizations or agencies. for example, for federal financial aid reporting purposes, credit hours in courses a student is auditing or has withdrawn from do not count towards full - time status. transfer course work from other institutions. the university of delaware accepts credits from higher education degree - granting institutions that are regionally - accredited by the appropriate body and at the appropriate higher educational level. institutions outside the us must have comparable recognition by the national ministry of education of that country. college - level coursework completed at degree - granting colleges/universities with other accreditation may be eligible for transfer credit. contact the office of the university registrar (<email>) for additional information. to transfer credits from approved institutions, students must submit official transcripts and official test scores from acceptable sources. coursework will only transfer for grades of c or better in college - level courses. remedial coursework, clep scores, pass - fail grades, and life experiences are not accepted for transfer of credit. course content not aligning with the university's curriculum may not transfer. additionally, academic departments may require students to repeat outdated courses and/or coursework completed more than seven calendar years earlier. courses taken under a different credit system will be converted to ud semester hours (ex. quarter hours x 2/3 or 6/7 semester hours). the office of the university registrar will complete a preliminary evaluation of transfer credit for students offered admission to the university of delaware. at times, courses that received a preliminary evaluation of general elective credit may prove to be directly equivalent to a ud course if re - evaluated by the appropriate academic department. only admitted students that have earned and transferred credits to ud may pursue re - evaluation (third - parties, parents, etc. may not pursue re - evaluation of coursework). students pursuing re - evaluation of departmental elective credits will need to provide course descriptions for faculty review. the final determination regarding equivalent coursework and the number of credit hours applicable to the program at the university of delaware rests with the academic departments. the university of delaware awards limited credit for military service. students may receive physical education credit and either military science credit or air force science credit with completion of basic training and leadership training. students must submit official documents (either the joint services transcript or community college of the air force transcript) for evaluation by the appropriate departments. students may earn up to six credits as follows: up to two credits of bhan 120 and up to four credits of either afsc 150, afsc 151, afsc 250, and afsc 251 or mlsc 105, mlsc 106, mlsc 205, and mlsc 206. see <url> for additional information. students enrolled at the university of delaware who wish to complete coursework for credit at another institution must complete a transfer credit evaluation form and obtain their assistant dean's approval prior to enrolling in such courses in order to assure transferability of coursework. credits and quality points for work completed elsewhere will not be included in the student's university of delaware cumulative grade - point index. for more detailed instructions regarding approval procedures, visit the office of the university registrar's transfer credit website. students who want to know whether the courses they are taking or plan to take will transfer to the university of delaware may consult the transfer credit matrix. the transfer credit matrix is designed to be a resource to identify potential transfer credit and associated university of delaware course equivalents from completed course work at other academic institutions. students taking coursework at other institutions should be aware of the university's residency policy. to receive a university of delaware baccalaureate degree, admitted students must complete 90% of the first 100 credits or 30% of the last 36 credits (full or part - time) at the university of delaware. to receive an associate degree, at least 31% of the required 60 credits must be earned at the university of delaware. additional baccalaureate residency requirements may be required within individual majors and minors. students with questions about meeting this requirement should consult the assistant dean of their college. sometimes exceptions to requirements are possible. specific degree requirements may be modified with permission and approval from the department chair and/or deans office upon petition by the student and presentation of a compelling case. any approved exemptions, waivers, or course substitutions need to be submitted via the course substitution webform (see here for assistance) so that the modification will be reflected in the students' degree audit. courses can be revised in future cycles to include or remove university or college - level designations (breadth, multicultural, capstone, etc.). these courses are not applicable for exceptions or substitutions if taken when it did not have a designation and was revised to include the designation. exemption. a student may request to be excused from a course requirement, receiving no credit for the course and no reduction in the total number of credits required for the degree. waiver. a student may request to be excused from a course requirement, thereby reducing the total number of credits required for the degree by the amount of credit for the course requirement being waived. substitution -

nope. still here. still alive and kicking, still in beijing. perhaps you will excuse my absence if i let you in on the reason for my loa. i've been holed up working on a whole new chinese reading practice. this site design, as you may have noticed, is a shambling mummified fossil and looks horrific on mobile devices. opening it gives me the sadz. and as i do not like having the sadz, i decided it was time for a refresh. plus, i keep opening these emails from you guys demanding more, more, more posts. truth is, i can't afford to devote the time to writing those posts unless i'm charging a little bit for it. i'm a freelancer; every time i update crp, it eats into my billable hours. on the other hand, i kind of love that crp is a free resource for casual learners. my favorite thing about the internet is that it represents so much collective good will. you ever heard that term cognitive surplus? neither had i until i watched this rad talk by professor clay shirky. in it, shirky basically defines cognitive surplus as the way we use our mental downtime. look at wikipedia, right? most of the contributors to wikipedia are volunteers. they use their mental downtime, their cognitive surplus, to edit articles about like the lifecycle of jellyfish and the population of singapore. they get nothing tangible out of this, so why do they do it? what is the root of that compulsion? i don't have the answer to that question, but i do know that that's the spirit of the digital age. i have some pretty strong feelings about how important it is. that being the case, i'm gonna do a little experiment here. i'm gonna try to do both. the new crp shall feature a new free post every darn week for you sunday - morning - over - coffee readers. there shall also be reasonably - priced memberships for you chinese reading diehards, with a members library and new members only posts daily. we'll see how that pans out. i'm looking at a feb 27, 2017 launch date or thereabouts. until then, enjoy the archive here and my friends. comments 23 may 2016 beginner children's stories beginner. yayzors, horsies! i know that when you first start reading, it's hard to hold a narrative thread through a longer post, but give this one a try. 6 short paragraphs, all of them very straightforward. this one has mostly very beginner language, with a couple of intermediate or upper - intermediate words. the grammar, rather than the vocab, is probably the hard part of this post, which is an great survey of every basic chinese sentence structure. if you can read this, your foundation in chinese grammar is very solid. comments 112 apr 2016 advanced advanced poems rhymes. hey guys. been a while. i'm studying chinese irl, so i've got less reason to focus on the blog, but i have been getting all the letters, thank you all. i've also received two guest posts that i'm embarrassed to say i haven't put up yet. apologies; it may be a while, but they're coming. right on with the poetry. kinda kills me how little information is available on the modern chinese writers, you know? a few of the most famous works have been translated, but most have only cursory mentions. even the wikipedia pages don't have nearly the amount of content that the chinese encyclopedias offer. dai wangshu, for example, is relatively unknown in the west. so who is this guy? dai wangshu () was a famously - depressed modern chinese symbolist poet, born in 1905, died from an accidental overdose of asthma medication in 1950, asthma which he contracted when he was thrown in jail by the japanese for advocating revolution. seriously, this guy spent his entire life having the sadz. he threatened to kill himself a couple of times, once to force his girlfriend to marry him (she agreed but then ran off with a refrigerator salesman cuz i guess refrigerators were a big deal at the time) and once when his first wife fell in love with another man and... comments 6 sep 2015 children's stories intermediate intermediate. feels like it's been a hundred years since i threw something up here. rest assured, i carry the shame of an unupdated blog around with me constantly, so yay guilt. i'm actually taking intensive classes in chinese yet again to push my reading level higher, hence the lack of posts. i'm more active on here when i'm not studying anywhere else. anyhoo, this is another one i nabbed from sina user zifenglings personal blog. i tried to convince myself that this was beginner, but i just couldn't. the words are mostly ok, but there are one too many wibble - wobbly sentence configurations. comments 32 mar 2015 beginner children's stories beginner. a fairly simple read for newbies about a self - hating rabbit. comments 183 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 last advanced 40 advanced poems rhymes 1 advanced story behind the idiom 2 advertisements 1 around the internet 2 books movies music advanced 11 essays 6 food recipes 5 news items advanced 10 short fiction 1 beginner 41 beginner story behind the idiom 1 children's stories beginner 14 essays beginner 13 jokes and riddles beginner 6 songs poems and rhymes 3 textbook passages 3 crp updates news 5 reading practice site written by chinese teachers. modern, contemporary and useful topics. tons of great short stories with translations, many with audio. mdbg offers a downloadable real - time dictionary program; download, install and any chinese text will be translated on hover. blog collector",

        "text": "ancient mesopotamia: this history, our history. <url> university of chicago oriental institute museum. printer - friendly version. reviewed by nancy l. stockdale, university of north texas, october 2006. this website is a treasure trove of information and imagery, beautifully presented and expertly organized. established to guide educators in presenting clearly - conceived and meaningful information about ancient mesopotamia, the project is successful in making relevant connections between the ancients and our own world. for, the site's designers consciously remind visitors that ancient mesopotamia is modern iraq. the site presents four sections: a fine collection of teaching materials, including 16 full lesson plans; a learning collection of 142 artifacts and photographs of archeological sites; an interactives section that presents interviews with three archeologists and detailed analyses of 13 artifacts; and a section entitled life in mesopotamia, presenting details on 14 topics surrounding daily life in ancient mesopotamia. all of these areas provide vital materials that will help students and educators alike in studying the lives of everyday people in ancient iraq. a central theme of the site, presented most prominently in the section devoted to everyday life, is the connection between the innovative inventions of mesopotamians and their essential role in creating key features of civilization still central to our world today. mesopotamian inventions such as large - scale agriculture, urbanization, centralized government, and writing are taken for granted by students. however, by learning the history of these and many other innovations that made civilization possible, students walk away with a more well - defined notion of how the study of ancient history relates to their own societies. such linkages between the past and the present are always a welcome aspect in any presentation of remote history, and in this case are doubly welcome because they provide a proud and important history of iraq that may counter the violent images students gain from media coverage of the now - war - torn nation. fourteen topics are explored in depth in the life in mesopotamia section, including religion, the first farmers, the role of women, and the invention of writing. each topic is presented with an introductory essay, a variety of images and artifacts from the oriental institute's collection, and links to lesson plans and related classroom activities. these plans are provided in easy - to - use pdf - formatted files and include contact information for experts at the chicago historical society. although it may be that only teachers in the chicago area may take full advantage of field trip information, educators everywhere may utilize these online resources, giving the oriental institute far greater reach than possible prior to the internet. another fantastic element of this website that brings the museum experience a bit closer to the computer - savvy classroom is the interactives section. to use this section, educators and students must have shockwave flash and quicktime plugins installed on their computers. by doing so, they have access to a wide range of interviews with the oriental institute's director, its conservator, and prominent assyriologist dr. martha roth. topics include the significance of the code of hammurabi and a comparison between its laws and the laws of modern societies, the methods museum curators use to preserve and display ancient artifacts, and the real - life application of archeological pursuits in reference to ancient mesopotamian sites such as lamassu. there are 13 interactive artifact explorations as well. for example, an ancient pull toy allows website visitors to explore the usages of children's toys in mesopotamia in ways that simulate their original usage, an invaluable tool for making the artifact come alive for modern students. teachers of world history will definitely appreciate the learning collection unit of the website. the 142 artifacts and photographs of archeological sites have been expertly presented, cross - referenced, and explained for educators and students to easily access and study. visitors may search by name or browse the collection by the material used, the type of object, the time period, cultural themes, or the location where the object in question was found. for instance, a search for \"clay tablet\" calls up 76 results, including cuneiform tablets and stellae, various pieces of pottery, children's toys, school homework assignments, and religious figurines, all made from clay. each object is then accessible by zoomable photos, cross - referenced to related artifacts, pinpointed on a map revealing the location of its discovery, and presented alongside suggested supplementary reading. discussion questions are also provided, allowing teachers to use ready - made inquiries to get students engaged in class conversations. these questions could also be useful as homework assignments. finally, the site presents a fantastic teaching materials section. with clear directions on how to use the resources, teachers may choose from 16 well - conceived lesson plans that inspire maximum usage of the resources on the site. the lesson plans also provide fine assignments for inside and outside the classroom, such as having students write about their opinions regarding the greatest contributions of the mesopotamians to our world's heritage, helping students do research on the way mesopotamian innovations compare with modern ones, such as ancient and modern brain surgery, record - keeping, and the status of women in society, and watching films that boldly illustrate mesopotamian life, such as the the glassmakers of herat. one of the most relevant lesson plans for the purpose of the site, that is, linking the history of ancient mesopotamia to the modern world, is a symbols from history assignment that prompts students to research the use of ancient symbols in modern iraq using newspapers articles, library visits, and the internet. such assignments not only assist student learning about the ancient past but heighten awareness about current events as well. finally, a detailed list of how each lesson plan synchronizes with the national council for the social studies curriculum standards is a welcome addition for k - 12 educators. this website is a welcome addition for scholars, educators, and students of world history. the interactive archeological dig and enhanced flash presentations on ancient sites in iraq make this site especially useful as a teaching tool. by providing visual, written, and interactive information about ancient mesopotamia and modern iraq, as well as making the linkages between the ancient past and contemporary life, the designers of this website have given world history educators a fantastic gift that will surely be appreciated and copied.",

        "text": "in buildings, army, resources, clan castle. comments 423. share. the clan castle houses your treasury and any reinforcement troops or spells sent by your clanmates. ruin: level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4, level 5, level 6, level 7, level 8. summary: a clan castle is needed for creating or joining a clan. it houses troops which can either be placed as reinforcements during an attack or used as defenders when the player's base is under attack. players begin the game with a ruined clan castle. while it is in ruins, it is surrounded by obstacles, plants, and stones and can not be moved. rebuilding a clan castle requires 10,000 gold but does not require a free builder and its reconstruction happens instantly. once it is rebuilt, players are able to create a clan or join an existing one. the clan castle can also be moved once it is rebuilt; you do not need to join a clan first or remove any surrounding obstacles. once players join a clan, they have the ability to request once every 20 minutes or faster if the clan has a donation request wait time perk or if they bypass this wait time by using gems. also, players can add a message to tell other players what troops they would like. other clan members will see the request in the clan chat and can donate a certain number of troops, spells, or siege machines to the clan castle depending on the clan level and the player's clan castle level. starting at level 4, players can request for one housing spaces worth of spells from their clan mates; level 7 clan castles or higher allows them to hold two housing space worth of spells. starting at level 6, players can request for siege machines from their clan mates. players can use clan castle reinforcements during battle and any troops housed inside the clan castle can defend the player's village whenever he/she is offline. players can choose to toggle the defense status of defending clan castle troops to either guard mode or sleep mode. in guard mode, troops housed inside will defend the player's village from attacks whilst in sleep mode, troops housed inside will not do so. the latter mode can be useful to save clan castle troops for attacking, especially in clan wars. players receive experience points for each troop they donate. 1 experience point is earned for every housing space of troops donated; for example, donating 1 archer earns 1 experience point, whereas a giant will earn 5 experience points and a dragon 20 experience points. players can normally donate a maximum of 5 troops per request, though up to 8 can be donated in a higher level clan with the donation limit perk. every housing unit of troops donated counts towards the friend in need achievement. players receive 5 experience for each housing space of spells donated, so each dark spell or freeze spell yields 5 experience while 10 experience is gained for each 2 - space elixir spell donated. each spell donated will count towards the sharing is caring achievement. only one spell can be donated to each request at a time and this is independent of clan perks. this is regardless of whether or not that one spell takes up 1 or 2 housing space. players receive 30 experience for each siege machine donated. the clan castle is home to the treasury, which receives loot earned from star bonuses, clan wars, and clan games. this replaces the previous war loot storage space and is not dependent on the actual level of the clan castle itself. attackers can only steal a very small percentage (3%) of the loot stored within the treasury. defensive strategy: the clan castle troops are very important up in higher leagues. this is because they can distract and possibly kill attacking troops, reducing the attacking army size and wasting precious seconds. if your clan castle is in guard mode and enemy troops come within a 12 - tile radius of your clan castle, any troops donated by your clanmates will file out to attack. while defending, troops from your clan castle are able to jump over walls. this is also true for heroes. when the clan castle is selected, the activation radius can be seen like the range of a defense. it is the only building other than defenses and hero altars that demonstrates this behavior. if the clan castle is destroyed when defending, any troops remaining inside will not be able to deploy until it regenerates completely, although they are perfectly safe and will remain there until the next battle. this can happen when only air troops are used to destroy it and some or all of the troops inside can only target ground troops and thus will not deploy. try to place the clan castle somewhere near the center of the village so that the troops within will respond to attacks quickly from any direction. this will also make the clan castle hard to trigger, allowing the reinforcements to maximize damage inflicted on attacking troops. keep in mind that once enemy troops that have no favorite target become aware of defending clan castle troops, they will target those clan castle troops before they target any buildings. this urge will even prompt them to break through a wall if necessary to get to the defending troops. as such, placement of a clan castle full of archers behind an interior wall will force attacking troops to break the walls before attacking surrounding buildings, whether this is desired or not. this building has a lot of hitpoints, generally third only to the town hall and eagle artillery, making it a very good building for absorbing damage while your defenses attack. although the clan castle is a very useful building for defensive purposes, troops which target defenses (giants, hog riders, balloons, and golems) will not attack it or any of its defensive troops unless all of the defenses in the base have been destroyed. defensive units that survive an attack, regardless of their health level, will return to the clan castle at full health; if deployed offensively, they will need to be replaced regardless of whether they survive or not. if a base gets attacked by air units only, the troops that can attack air units (archers, wizards, dragons, baby dragons, minions, and witches in that order) will come and defend. all other troops will stay inside the clan castle until ground units are deployed. archers are great entry - level clan castle troops as they offer a substantial defense against both air and ground troops for little cost. their primary advantage is their ability to shoot from behind walls. however, an attacker with a poison spell will be able to quickly kill them. dragons are a very commonly used clan castle troop at town hall level 7 and above, especially in clan wars. they are resistant to single poison spells and do high splash damage against both ground and air troops. however, they have come to be expected by many players who will likely have a strategy to eliminate them. offensive strategy: it is crucial to try to lure the troops out of the defending clan castle when attacking. players can do this by deploying a single unit within the range of the enemy's clan castle. this is to prevent a situation where players are forced to fight these troops within range of the enemy's defenses. it's also useful to know what type of defending troops are in the clan castle before deploying the whole army, e.g., you don't want to deploy mass barbarians when the enemy has balloons defending his base. if you can not reach the castle's radius from the outside of the base, then use 1 - 2 hog riders as they can get closer by jumping over walls. once the enemy troops are fully lured out, if your luring troops die before all enemy units are deployed, you will need another lure, then take them out with a lightning spell or poison spell, or lure them out further and dispatch them with whatever troops you have. after luring the troops out, a player can choose to surrender the battle if you decide these troops put you in a disadvantageous position; ignore them (not recommended); kill them with a lightning spell or poison spell; or lure them farther away from the defensive buildings before battling them with your own troops. note that once deployed, clan castle troops no longer have a trigger radius and will travel the entire length of the map to attack any enemy units. use this to your advantage to draw them as far away from the defensive buildings as possible. an easy way of handling strong troops is to lure them far away from the base. place one giant at a far side, wait for the troops to come close, and then deploy archers in a circle around them; they should be taken down easily. this technique also works on heroes, although it is harder and heroes can't be lured far away from their trigger radius. when weaker troops come out of a clan castle, use a lightning spell or poison spell to get rid of them. these two spells only damage defending troops, not your own troops, so you may use it while the defenders have engaged your attacking troops without fear of friendly fire. another way to deal with a large number of weaker troops is to draw them out and deploy wizards if a lightning spell or poison spell is not available. the wizard's high splash damage can one - shot entire groups of low - health troops. remember that even if a clan castle has no clan shield, it can still have troops in it from previous clans. upgrade differences: the clan castle undergoes significant visual changes when it is initially repaired (level 1) and when it is upgraded to level 2, 5, and 8. much of the detail of the top of the clan castle is obscured by your clan symbol once you create or join a clan, however. when it first appears, it is ruined; it looks like the top has collapsed or the building has been damaged by an explosion. when you initially rebuild it to level 1, it appears as a square stone structure with sloped sides. it is adorned with a single window, two grey metal doors, and a wooden roof. at level 2, a battlemented platform is added to the wooden roof of the clan castle, resembling that of a level 8 town hall. a second window appears as well. at level 3, four corners of the clan castle receive wooden supports and shields are added to each corner of the battlemented platform; the small mat - sized paths right next to the doors change to steel as well. at level 4, the wooden supports are replaced with stone supports. the wooden roof is opened, revealing a ladder leading down inside the castle itself. the exterior of the clan castle receives gold embellishment on the doors, between the windows, and on the shields. at level 5, the clan castle is painted the same as the level 9 town hall. the walls become vertical and the doors receive stone trim. the ladder is now changed to grey steps and black shields are added to the corners of the castle. at level 6, the clan castle still has the same grey - black coloring; however, the shields are changed to gold, the roof is completely enclosed, and the doors gain yellow stripes. the roof is now fully closed once again. at level 7, the clan castle retains its gray - black coloring but its doors are much larger, plated with three golden stripes with the keyhole on the middle stripe. the shields on the corners are changed, being gold with grey borders and they are further reinforced with a golden stripe. between these shields, there is one golden ring resembling a door knocker for each wall. at level 8, the clan castle takes on a new blue - gray color scheme. the giant gold - plated doors are replaced with giant gray doors with dark gray edges with a golden keyhole in the middle. the shields are now replaced with spiked corner guards with bolts in the middle between the",

        "text": "painting by ivan shishkin. how to write a pantoum with example. the society, september 19, 2016. beauty for educators, poetry, poetry forms. 12 comments. by carol smallwood. the pantoum is a poetry form that originated in 15th - century malaysia and drifted west in the 19th century with french writer victor hugo among others. while it never quite took off like the haiku, it never fully went away either and has been steadily blossoming among english poets. unlike the 14 - line sonnet, pantoums do not have to be a certain length. the challenge comes with the repetition of two lines from the first stanza in the following stanza. additionally, in the traditional pantoum form that i prefer, the first line becomes the last line and the third line becomes the third from last. the payoff of a well - executed pantoum is a picture - like poem that seems to dance in circles outside the boundaries of time. this is the format i use: stanza 1: 4 lines, abab rhyme scheme. stanza 2: line 5: repeat of line 2 in stanza 1. line 6: new line. line 7: repeat of line 4 in stanza 1. line 8: new line. stanza 3 (last stanza): this is the format for the last stanza, regardless of how many preceding stanzas exist. line 9: line 2 of the previous stanza. line 10: line 3 of the first stanza. line 11: line 4 of the previous stanza. line 12: line 1 of the first stanza. as with other formal poems, one must not let the form drive the poem and select topics carefully, like when goldilocks is looking for a bed in three bears' house; it must be just right. other types of pantoums can be found here. my example pantoum: near the porch rails began when i noticed a red weed growing i hadn't seen before. curious, i looked at it closely and smiled as it seemed like beads and tried to find the name of it but couldn't online. however, names of others were delightful and decided to write about them as summer progressed. near the porch rails. new weeds bring surpriselike one with red

to essays on classical forms are quite popular with my poetry groups. the pantoum, due to its strong cyclic repetition, suits many subjects and i loved the way you spun a trip through the weeds into a nice circular web. nothing thrills me quite like seeing different themes explored using classic metering and form. i too prefer to create a crown from my pantoums and use the reverse of lines 1, 3 from the first stanza as 2, 4 in the final one. i find that this refrain style reinforces that opening line and provides the best closure. i have written several pantoums in this style as part of my new classic poetry collection and would love to share and get your opinion on a couple. these two are both written in iambic pentameter since the subject matter in both cases was enhanced by the soft edges that iambs give and the cadence falls nicely into a repetitive form. clouds clouds drift across the peaceful azure sky. as i sit quietly under this tree. i think of life's big questions and i sigh. i wonder if someday i'll truly see. as i sit quietly under this tree, the sun is warm shining upon my face. i wonder if someday i'll truly see the beauty hidden deep inside this place. the sun is warm shining upon my face, i stretch out gladly soaking up the light. the beauty hidden deep inside this place as arms of golden warmth embrace me tight. i stretch out gladly soaking up the light, i think of life's big questions and i sigh. as arms of golden warmth embrace me tight, clouds drift across the peaceful azure sky. dustygrein first kiss i floated home on clouds the day we met. that first great kiss changed everything and more. my life was full of \"haven't done that yet\". i'd never tasted someone's tongue before. that first great kiss changed everything and more, you taught me what it was to fall in love. i'd never tasted someone's tongue before, but kissing for you just wasn't enough. you taught me what it was to fall in love, my virgin hands were unsure what to do. but kissing for you just wasn't enough, you made me want to learn the rest from you. my virgin hands were unsure what to do, my life was full of \"haven't done that yet\". you made me want to learn the rest from you, i floated home on clouds the day we met. dustygrein carol smallwood, september 21, 2016. thank you for asking my opinion, dusty. i admire your skill with meter, which i rather not tackle but hopefully will. you sounded like you enjoyed writing them and hope you will continue and encouraged me to try meter again. carol smallwood, september 19, 2016. thank you for the painting to accompany the poem. classical art and formal poetry go well together and deserve more followers. betty bellous, september 19, 2016. i am not a poet but these pantoums are delightful and so much fun to find the lines that are repeated in a subsequent verse. thank you for introducing me to a form of poetry that i can enjoy. carol smallwood, september 21, 2016. thank you, betty, for reading the pantoum. i bet you could easily write one and enjoy, share the results. chris swanberg, september 19, 2016. carol, your attention to history and structure in this piece is admirable. thanks for sharing the interesting morphology and architecture of this unusual and very structured formal poetry. interesting reading and food for future poems. chris swanberg. carol smallwood, september 21, 2016. thank you, chris. when i first looked at the format i never thought i'd try one, but bit by bit it fall into place and now it is my favorite kind because it offers surprise at the end and not too much repetition of lines. i've run across many that are written using different rules than those i gave, modern versions perhaps you could say. i started with villanelles but now pantoums are the most fun for me. carole mertz, september 19, 2016. carol, i liked your description of the pantoum as being outside the boundaries of time. your example, near the porch rails, so well portrays the pantoum's circular dance. your listing of bull thistle after mouseear made me smile. thanks for your clear explanation of the pantoum's form. sorry to tease out a pantoum from me in response would put me so far outside the boundaries of time there'd be no return. carol smallwood, september 21, 2016. thank you, carole. you caught the essential magic of the pantoum when you mentioned boundaries of time. yes, i used the names of the weeds you mention because they were funny and the scientific names made them sound so serious. i've had to struggle getting the last stanza to work and ended up tossing the poems out sometimes, adding another stanza worked. lorna davis, september 20, 2016. carol, thank you for taking the time to write this. pantoums are new to me. what an interesting form. yes, i love the way it circles back around and finishes neatly at its beginning. dusty grein, i especially love your clouds. dusty grein, september 20, 2016. thank you, lorna. clouds was actually the first pantoum i ever wrote and is still one of my favorites as well. it almost became the lead - off poem in my forthcoming collection but was overridden by a terza rima that touched me deeply when i wrote it. carol smallwood, september 21, 2016. thank you, lorna, for reading and sending a comment. yes, the circling back round is the challenging thing, as often i've had to either add, remove a stanza or two, or toss the poem out when it made no sense. this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed.",

contact. i know this from personal experience. canned biscuits: as long as they haven't exploded, use them. in my younger day (ie young, always broke and a single mom working and going to school), i even used one can that had already exploded, and we are still alive to tell the story. martha, if the pie shell was one you made and then froze, i think i would pitch it. if it was one manufactured and bought, it contains preservatives, so thaw and sniff. it may be ok. by the way, if it was store - bought, i want you to run over to my house and i'll show you how to make one super fast and at a fraction of the cost. it always turns out great. ok, i declare to you that woman must not depend upon the protection of man, but must be taught to protect herself, and there i take my stand. susan b. anthony. wed dec 21, 2011 12:53 pm. in reply to karen k. joined on tue feb 24, 2009. new york mills, mn. posts: 1327. re: canned biscuits, how long will they keep?

life experiences. hence, many of the literary works of costa rica focus more on lighter subject matters such as hope, peace, celebration, and cooperation. this lack of subject matter has also given costa rica the reputation for being limited in its prose. this is not to say that. the 1950s gave way to new trends in incorporating psychology into literature as a new element. many writers took a deeper look into regional matters and day - to - day people. then the 1970s and 1980s gave costa rica a reason to write again with the struggles of an economic crisis and mass unemployment. to everyone's surprise, costa ricans, unlike other latin american countries, chose not to write about socialist ideals. instead, authors wanted to take a closer look at identity and how each person could ambitiously overcome their circumstances through social protest. mainly, literature has been used as a cultural. famous writers costa rica has always been under the influence of the most famous latin american writers who have become household names, such as gabriel garcia marquez, octavio paz, jorge amado, pablo neruda, isabel allende, or jorge luis borge. some of costa rica's most well -

style vinyl consists of two parts. first, there is the vinyl part, and then there was a fairly thick paper backing. the paper, and sometimes the vinyl, is attached to the floor with some type of special. removing the vinyl itself is going to require some kind of scraper, and more than likely some brute force. there are videos showing some kind of burner to burn the vinyl off. i can not see doing this for several reasons. first, it would be impossible for me with the wood floors. second, burning pvc creates a very bad gas, and it guarantees you will be sick. third, it will probably smoke up the rest of the house. the other options i have seen are using a hand scraper, a scraping attachment on an oscillating tool such as the dremel, heat gun method: how to remove old linoleum, dremel method: removing stubborn linoleum the easy way with the dremal, hand scraping method: how to scrape off linoleum flooring, home improvement tips. i chose primarily the hand scraping method with some of the dremel method to start lifting the vinyl. i chose to score my flooring in about 2 x 2 squares. that seemed to me to be an area i could handle, and not continually having to start at an edge. the following video shows me doing a particularly hard part of the floor. for some reason, the glue stuck extra tight there. all of the tools i used are shown on my page: tools, scraping and cleaning. once the vinyl layer was removed, then came the really fun part: removing the paper and glue. at first, i just used a scraper, but it was very hard to not create gashes in the luan plywood underlayment. eventually, i went to using a steam iron to force the steam through the paper and weaken the glue. i was concerned about what this would do to the plywood, but the steam evaporated quickly, and there was no detectable damage to the plywood. i worked in small areas the size of a wash cloth, and used a razor blade scraper instead. the hot iron method: removing gluempg. this is what you don't want to do unless you can't avoid it. the next picture shows some of the damage i did to the plywood. this was the part of the floor where the old vinyl seemed to be glued the best, and this is also before i started using the steam iron. i was able to fill the gashes, so everything will be alright with the new floor. there is another way all this can be done. if i was going to a completely different type of flooring, it would have been the only way. that is to rip up the vinyl and the luan plywood at the same time. scraping the paper before i started using the steam iron and razor scraper. after all the paper and glue was removed, it was necessary to fill in the floor. this would have been necessary even if i had not created the gashes, because there were dimples from the nails and the seams between the sheets of plywood. repairing the gashes made this all the more important. the type of vinyl i installed is sheet vinyl, but it is very thick and has a fibreglass backing. it can be left floating, in other words, not glued down. however, i had a minor problem during the installation day. the weather was hot, and the air - conditioner came on. i initially had not cut out the floor vent hole, and the blower trapped air under the floor. the waves were so great it would just about make you seasick. even after cutting the vent hole and installing the register, enough air leaked under the flooring that i had some bubbles. filling the floor so the vinyl was over a smooth surface. all in all, the project went well, but it was very time - consuming. sheet vinyl was good for that floor, because the room dimensions in one direction is less than 12, and 12 is the standard width for roll vinyl. i have another room to do with much larger dimensions. i am looking at a newer form of flooring for it called floating plank vinyl. it will still mean having to remove the existing flooring, because it is in very bad shape. as always, i hope you got something from this post, although it is not typical of the types of posts i normally do. gary. removing old glued -

        "text": "miami dolphins retooling qb brock osweiler's mechanics in offseason work. jason lieser, june 5, 2018. 2018 offseason. jason lieser. 3. brock osweiler's mechanics are getting a makeover this offseason. allen eyestone/the post. davie - the dolphins didn't bring beleaguered quarterback brock osweiler on as a favor or to be merely a camp arm. there is belief in the organization that they can salvage a player who's been discarded by houston, cleveland and denver in the last two years, and they're already seeing some strides. osweiler is just 27 and has made 25 starts, leaving room to be optimistic that he's not fully formed as a quarterback yet. the first step for miami has been to rework his form. \"we're doing some things mechanically with him to kind of make everything consistent, which he's doing a really good job,\" quarterbacks coach bo hardegree said. \"i think he's throwing the ball really well and he's really fun to be around. it's a good that we have right now that we're working with this offseason.\" if the dolphins can turn him into a viable backup, it'll be an impressive accomplishment. osweiler overlapped with coach adam gase in denver from 2012 through 14 and filled in extensively for peyton manning in the 2015 season. he posted an 86.4 passer rating and had 10 touchdowns against six interceptions, and it didn't hurt that the broncos went 5 - 2 in his starts. that run earned him a four - year, $72 million contract with the texans, but he was a disaster in his lone season with them. after watching osweiler throw more interceptions than touchdowns, complete under 60 percent of his passes and put up a passer rating in the low 70s (even 2017 jay cutler cracked 80 for comparison), houston gave up a second - round pick just to get cleveland to take the contract. the browns hoped osweiler would give them something as a backup but ultimately cut him before the season began. he returned to denver and had five touchdowns, five interceptions and a 72.5 passer rating in six games (four starts). he lingered on the free - agent market long enough for the dolphins to consider adding him to a quarterback corps headlined by ryan tannehill and featuring david fales as the likely backup. to osweiler's credit, he's shown humility and been realistic about where he's at in his career at this point. battling fales for the backup job wasn't beneath him. \"i probably took longer than everybody else,\" gase said. \"when we started the free agency process, guys were talking about the fact that he's 27 - years - old. he's played for you before and you were part of the guys that drafted him. you know him well. he wants to be here. they were almost selling me. i really had to go through things and just make sure that he was good getting back with me and understanding the situation we were in and kind of what he was going to be competing for. hearing him and where he was mentally and what he wanted to accomplish and how he kind of wanted to get his career rolling again, after we had that conversation and we got him in the building, everybody really liked him. i felt good about it. we ended up making that move and ever since then i'm seeing the same guy that i saw in his younger years.\" hardegree worked with osweiler in denver too. he was an offensive quality control assistant when gase was there in 2014, went on to the bears as one of gase's assistants in 2015, and got hired as the dolphins quarterbacks coach in 2016. what he's seen right away from osweiler is a good grasp of gase's offense and, equally important, an ability to make sure everyone else knows how the plays are supposed to work. \"he's really strong with it,\" hardegree said. \"he understands what we're looking for. he gets the ball out of his hands and he's a good communicator as far as for a coach too. he'll come right back to you and say, 'i should've done this' or 'what do you think about this?' he wants to learn on every play and you love that as a coach.\" tannehill is the unquestioned starter and the dolphins did not draft a quarterback this year. fales, whose history with gase goes back to chicago, played some due to injuries last season. gase's comments about him have hinted that he's the man to beat for the no. 2 job. osweiler will get his shot but also must compete with new york jets castoff bryce petty. petty was a fourth - round pick in 2015 and has 10 career nfl appearances. he struggled tremendously for the jets (53.1 percent completions, four touchdowns, 10 interceptions) and was waived after they drafted sam darnold. kenny stills is exactly what the nfl needs, so why is it alienating him?

        "text": "traveling student post, 12 sep 2011. global business undergraduate 0. a few facts about santiago, chile. by nicole winjum foster, undergraduate. i have been working on this blog post for awhile, making note of differences and simple facts of life i have seen while living in santiago, chile. it's certainly not a complete list, and i am sure i'm forgetting something, but here are a few of the things i've noticed. pda. there is a lot of it, and not just the hand - holding, brief kiss on the lips kind. i'm talking making out on the subway, literally lying on top of each other in the park, openly groping each other in the street kind. in the united states, pda is usually frowned upon, and while you might see the occasional couple going at it, those sightings are few and far between. but not here. if you are young and in love in santiago, you are all for displaying that love for everybody to see. seeing couples being so touchy - feely in public has... dogs. they are everywhere. not only does just about every chilean family seem to own a dog or three, but there is an abundance of street dogs with no apparent home. you can always hear dogs barking at all hours of the day and night, and everywhere you look there are dogs laying about in the sun. and the truly surprising thing is that, unlike the half - starved, mangy dogs in costa rica, these dogs all seem to be fairly well fed. streets. nobody cleans them. i mean, not every street is covered in stuff, but many are. this was most noticeable in valparaiso, but it's true in santiago too. the other day when i was riding the micro (that's the bus system), we passed by a street that looked like an entire farmers market worth of vegetables got thrown about. it was crazy. and it isn't just vegetables and pieces of plastic. due to the abundance of dogs i mentioned earlier, there is dog crap everywhere. you have to constantly be on the lookout so you don't accidentally step in something gross. bread. eaten with every meal. which is actually something i am quite thrilled with. i love bread, and due to my somewhat finicky eating habits, it is often the only food i can eat while traveling to foreign countries. but the chileans eat bread as often as the french. it's primarily sold in these funny little 4 - roll loaves (see photo). for breakfast, you might have one or two rolls slathered in butter and jam with a cup of tea. for lunch and dinner, you may use a roll to clean your plate or as an appetizer. for dessert, a little bit... smoking. everybody does it. i'm no stranger to smoking. my mom smokes, and i know a lot of people who might smoke a cigarette or two while drinking, but most of the people i know back home really do not smoke. which is not that surprising, considering the ad campaigns and research studies we are inundated with telling us that smoking kills. but here, it is as if nobody is getting those messages. i have heard about places like france having a lot of smokers, but i just was not really expecting it here. the most surprising is the number of lemons. they love them. seriously. i never knew people could like lemons so much; they put it on everything. you ordered a salad? squeeze some lemon juice on it. you're eating some fish? it'll taste better with some lemon juice on it. you want a snack? just snack on a lemon. i have literally seen people on the bus just sucking on a lemon. with dinner every night, we usually have a side salad, which is iceberg lettuce with lemon juice, oil, and salt. sometime we will have a carrot salad or a broccoli salad or a cauliflower salad. which just... a few other things to note. the typical greeting is the one - cheek kiss, and it can get awkward if you go for the handshake and they go for your face. they are big fans of avocado here, which surprised me for some reason, but i love avocado, so it's okay with me. there is a sad lack of cheese here, and the few types they have are pretty expensive. i want to eat more or less like a local, so it isn't so bad, but i am definitely missing cheese. names can get a bit confusing. in my 25 - person marketing class, there are 7 girls named maria. this isn't the spanish you have been learning in class. yes, the words are more or less the same, but their vocab is a little different, and some phrases have different connotations. they also speak very fast here, and sometimes drop the \"s\". the youth say \"cachai\" after almost every sentence, which basically means \"you know, understand\". \"ciao\" is the customary goodbye around here. i know i lot of countries use \"ciao\" as a goodbye, but i still associate it with europe, so it caught me a bit off guard. chile exchange, pontificia catolica, south america. undergrads go global.",

aimed and difficult to dodge out in the open, but because they are slow - acting, dodging by chance is made easier by observing their actions. wizards can also summon a dark sphere of energy, which is frequently done when their shield is taken down. hive that stand within are healed, but such energy is a poison to guardians. it inflicts damage, dulls your perception, and slows you down. wizards are protected by a solar shield. when this shield is destroyed, the wizard is vulnerable, but their ability to levitate makes them nimble targets in the air. they are also capable of a short teleport, though they do not use it often. on higher difficulty tiers, a wizard's basic darkness blast becomes faster and more deadly, increasing their lethality. wizards are intelligent, unlike other enemies. if the player draws their attention and damages them, they will hide behind a wall to heal quickly. they will also have another enemy protect them while they are healing up. tactics wizards are dangerous opponents, and it is best to dispatch them as swiftly as possible. wizards hover around the battle zone while you are fighting other hive units, healing them and pelting you with darkness blasts, increasing the difficulty. in terms of wasted time and efficiency, wizards are a major annoyance. heavy machine gun fire or sniper shots work well to quickly take them down. a fusion rifle blast from medium range is quite effective too. like all hive, the head is the wizard's weak point. because they are nimble aerial units, they are difficult to target with grenades or rockets, unlike other hive units. when targeting a wizard, avoid using these weapons unless the rocket launcher fires homing rockets. a fireteam can damage a wizard from several angles, keeping her in an offensive position and making for an easier kill. variants ascendant wizard, brood mother, chosen wizard, hallowed wizard, siphon witch. notable wizards alzok dal, balwur, gornuk dal, gotra, eir spawn, heart of crota, ir anuk deathsinger, ir halak deathsinger, ir yut the deathsinger, lokaar, mormu, xol spawn, omnigul the will of crota, rakta the mournful, vurok eir spawn, xyor the unwed, zyrok dal. gallery animated render of omnigul. add a photo to this gallery. references 10, 11, 12. miller, matt. january 2014 print edition. a player's journey, destiny. game informer. retrieved 31 dec. 2013. 20, 21, <phone>. youtube.com. official destiny gameplay trailer: the moon. 127. retrieved 2 jan. 2014. list of grimoire cards: wizard. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. september 2014 print edition. first look inside the strategy guide. planetdestiny.com. retrieved 6 sept. 2014. v d e classes. categories: hive classes. destiny wiki. discord. 117 members online. destiny general. members online. iirs_ . destiny 2 . allennotalan, aporia, warframe, archifel, arthas menethil, europa universalis iv, auntjomama, destiny 2 autopatch, bchaos, bred savage, spotify, buwsr, camil, cheese, chriszippodelu, cia391, cocidius, fortnite, codybye, commanderbreen, crankr, creaton, daffyduck254, gummy, ghost, deasert, death, deathhymn, deeply, desolite, donis, dovahkiin, drfitking117, forza horizon 4, ducklife, nioh complete edition, erg_apollo, evilmanmark, eziokenway7, filthycasual, warframe, fisherman69, foxburton99, ghostassasin105, fallout 76, god, hero, , gutuye, hardison, league of legends, harry heinz, getz ze ketchupz, destiny 2, hermes, home fries, dcs world, iamvenom, int, ishamael1337, jaguarrevere, jesselless, destiny 2, jiaasjen1313, julnya, junpei, kamen rider stronger, kennethreitz, kesha, dont starve together, kingdiablo, call of duty black ops 4, kohones, lancerfodder, lewd, lvluffinstation, destiny 2, maxicheese273, fortnite, me pica to el pokepito, smite, melange396, mootjester, playerunknowns battlegrounds, mordekai007, mosolmen, mrwafflefish, muki, nersty_, netofficialyt, new am1sh, nfsinternational, nyros, obeseonion, call of duty black ops 4, ok, so basically its 2019, ozzy, pickos, destiny 2, pingu, punkforeveryone, pw99, ranger, evga precision xoc, ravenbiker, forza horizon 4, ravenson, rhyq, fivem, sd379, sapper, scrublordsama, shaxie, destiny 2, siika, tinder, silwn, skugg_sjo, , destiny 2, skukuza, smashingjab, spoogebob squarehead, squishie, destiny 2, supermonkey, synblackout, tankmaster, destiny 2, teampls, atlas, terrorspy, destiny 2, the gentle giant, the warden, fallout 4, theglitchedchef, thunda, tigersnake, totallymysterious, trowl42, wallpaper engine, v4h33d, destiny 2, verdigris, weiner, wilkie 1a, destiny 2, xemphas, xizorblacksun, your_waifu, , warframe. free voice chat from discord. recent wiki activity reef wars. obey. golden. 3 hours ago. hidden swarm. m67pattonzippo. 13 hours ago. m67pattonzippo. 13 hours ago. taken. grunty89. 13 hours ago. help us grow destiny wiki. get started.",

it was available for a relatively short amount of time. shortly after the us theatrical run, it was reedited yet again for a two - part presentation on disney's television series in the 1970s, simply omitting the middle segment. the original three - part miniseries version was first shown on disney's wonderful world of color on february 9, 16, and 23, 1964, and shown again there a few times, included in a late 1980s wonderful world of disney syndicated rerun package, and cablecast in 1990s on the disney channel. this version generally followed the storyline of the further adventures of doctor syn and made it clear that syn did not die or stage his own death at the film's end;

built and designed with the utmost security and fidelity principles in mind. how advanced? the facility in plattekloof is about 28,000m of floor space, housing about 500 staff members, two - thirds of whom are forensic scientists working in laboratories containing pieces of equipment valued at up to r4 million each, capable of accurately analysing evidence, be it dna, bullet casings and cartridges, documents, signatures or drugs and alcohol. the police forensic laboratory was built at an estimated cost of r600m and doesn't fit the mould of traditional government buildings, which are often retrofitted to suit the purpose of the departments they house. brigadier deon meintjes, who runs the facility, explains that the lab was built by the department of public works to the unit's requirements and was designed without too much external input or influence from other labs around the world. \"we designed and built it to suit our needs. you'll notice all of the various departments have the same kind of layout; the offices are situated around the outskirts of a central core, the labs. this is so that all of the fitments run centrally, from the nederman arms (adjustable ventilation ducts to keep harmful or toxic fumes away from lab technicians) to the water and gas pipes and the rail cart system.\" to continue reading the full article, please click here. source: this article was first published online by iol news on the 13th of june 2016. posted in crime scenes, dna act, forensic career. comments off on inside the saps forensics lab. on the graveyard shift, this is what it's like to collect south africa's dead. fri apr 8th 2016. selby cindi from johannesburg forensic pathology services and a johannesburg metro police officer lift the body of an accident victim from a street in the johannesburg cbd. image alon skuy. the following article published by the sunday times takes a fascinating look at south africa's forensic pathology services. five nights, four bodies. reporter graeme hosken and photographer alon skuy spent the graveyard shift with the men and women who collect south africa's dead. body 38 lies on a steel gurney in carletonville forensic pathology service's new fridge. the government -

is called a querystring. traditionally, the querystring is used to contextualize the url by passing a set of key - value pairs. the format for those pairs is key = value. each pair being separated by a & character. notice how we have to convert the given length value to an integer. indeed, values are sent out from the client to our server as strings. much like cherrypy maps url path segments to exposed functions, querystring keys are mapped to those exposed function parameters. tutorial 4: submit this form cherrypy is a web framework upon which you build web applications. the most traditional shape taken by applications is through an html user - interface speaking to your cherrypy server. let's see how to handle html forms via the following example. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator: cherrypy.expose def index(self): return \"\"\"<html><head></head><body><form method = \"get\" action = \"generate\"><input type = \"text\" value = \"8\" name = \"length\"><button type = \"submit\">give it now</button></form></body></html>\"\"\" cherrypy.expose def generate(self, length = 8): return ''.join(random.sample(string.hexdigits, int(length))) if __name__ == \"__main__\": cherrypy.quickstart(stringgenerator) save this into a file named tut04.py and run it as follows: python tut04.py go now to <url> and your browser and this will display a simple input field to indicate the length of the string you want to generate. notice that in this example, the form uses the get method and when you pressed the button, the form is sent using the same url as in the previous tutorial. html forms also support the post method. in that case, the querystring is not appended to the url but it sent as the body of the client's request to the server. however, this would not change your application's exposed method because cherrypy handles both the same way and uses the exposed's handler parameters to deal with the querystring key - value pairs. tutorial 5: track my end - users activity it's not uncommon that an application needs to follow the users' activity for a while. the usual mechanism is to use a session identifier that is carried during the conversation between the user and your application. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator: cherrypy.expose def index(self): return \"\"\"<html><head></head><body><form method = \"get\" action = \"generate\"><input type = \"text\" value = \"8\" name = \"length\"><button type = \"submit\">give it now</button></form></body></html>\"\"\" cherrypy.expose def generate(self, length = 8): some_string = ''.join(random.sample(string.hexdigits, int(length))) cherrypy.session['mystring'] = some_string return some_string cherrypy.expose def display(self): return cherrypy.session['mystring'] if __name__ == \"__main__\": conf = {'tools.sessions.on': true} cherrypy.quickstart(stringgenerator, conf = conf) save this into a file named tut05.py and run it as follows: python tut05.py in this example, we generate the string as in the previous tutorial but also store it in the current session. if you go to <url> a random string, then go to <url> you will see the string you just generated. the lines 30 - 34 show you how to enable the session support in your cherrypy application. by default, cherrypy will save sessions in the process's memory. it supports more persistent backends as well. tutorial 6: what about my javascripts, css and images? web applications are usually also made of static content such as javascript, css files or images. cherrypy provides support to serve static content to end - users. let's assume you want to associate a stylesheet with your application to display a blue background color (why not?). first, save the following stylesheet into a file named style.css and stored into a local directory public/css: 1. 2. 3. body { background - color: blue; } now let's update the html code so that we link to the stylesheet using the <url> url. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. 36. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. import os import os.path import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator: cherrypy.expose def index(self): return \"\"\"<html><head><link href = \"static/css/style.css\" rel = \"stylesheet\"></head><body><form method = \"get\" action = \"generate\"><input type = \"text\" value = \"8\" name = \"length\"><button type = \"submit\">give it now</button></form></body></html>\"\"\" cherrypy.expose def generate(self, length = 8): some_string = ''.join(random.sample(string.hexdigits, int(length))) cherrypy.session['mystring'] = some_string return some_string cherrypy.expose def display(self): return cherrypy.session['mystring'] if __name__ == \"__main__\": conf = {'tools.sessions.on': true, 'tools.staticdir.root': os.path.abspath(os.getcwd() + \"/static\"), 'tools.staticdir.on': true, 'tools.staticdir.dir': \"public\"} cherrypy.quickstart(stringgenerator, conf = conf) save this into a file named tut06.py and run it as follows: python tut06.py going to <url> you should be greeted by a flashy blue color. cherrypy provides support to serve a single file or a complete directory structure. most of the time this is what you'll end up doing so this is what the code above demonstrates. first, we indicate the root directory of all of our static content. this must be an absolute path for security reason. cherrypy will complain if you provide only relative paths when looking for a match to your urls. then we indicate that all urls which path segment starts with static will be served as static content. we map that url to the public directory, a direct child of the root directory. the entire subtree of the public directory will be served as static content. cherrypy will map urls to path within that directory. this is why static/css/style.css is found in public/css/style.css. tutorial 7: give us a rest it's not unusual nowadays that web applications expose some sort of data - model or computation functions. without going into its details, one strategy is to follow the rest principles edicted by roy t. fielding. roughly speaking, it assumes that you can identify a resource and that you can address that resource through that identifier. what for you may ask? well, mostly these principles are there to ensure that you decouple as best as you can the entities your application expose from the way they are manipulated or consumed. to embrace this point of view, developers will usually design a web api that expose pairs of url, http method, data constraints. note: you will often hear rest and web api together. the former is one strategy to provide the latter. this tutorial will not go deeper in that whole web api concept as it's a much more engaging subject, but you ought to read more about it online. let's go through a small example of a very basic web api mildly following rest principles. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35. import random import string import cherrypy cherrypy.expose class stringgeneratorwebservice: cherrypy.tools.accept(media = 'text/plain') def get(self): return cherrypy.session['mystring'] def post(self, length = 8): some_string = ''.join(random.sample(string.hexdigits, int(length))) cherrypy.session['mystring'] = some_string return some_string def put(self, another_string): cherrypy.session['mystring'] = another_string def delete(self): cherrypy.session.pop('mystring', none) if __name__ == \"__main__\": conf = {'request.dispatch': cherrypy.dispatch.methoddispatcher, 'tools.sessions.on': true, 'tools.response_headers.on': true, 'tools.response_headers.headers': {'contenttype': 'text/plain'}} cherrypy.quickstart(stringgeneratorwebservice, conf = conf) save this into a file named tut07.py and run it as follows: python tut07.py before we see it in action, let's explain a few things. until now, cherrypy was creating a tree of exposed methods that were used to match urls. in the case of",

disables dual stack mode: uv_udp_ipv6only (1). - indicates message was truncated because read buffer was too small. the remainder was discarded by the os. used in uv_udp_recv_cb: uv_udp_partial (2). - indicates if so_reuseaddr will be set when binding the handle in uv_udp_bind. this sets the so_reuseport socket flag on the bsds and os x. on other unix platforms it sets the so_reuseaddr flag. what that means is that multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error provided they all set the flag, but only the last one to bind will receive any traffic, in effect stealing the port from the previous listener: uv_udp_reuseaddr (4). void uv_udp_send_cb(uv_udp_send_t req, int status): type definition for callback passed to uv_udp_send, which is called after the data was sent. void uv_udp_recv_cb(uv_udp_t handle, ssize_t nread, const uv_buf_t buf, const struct sockaddr addr, unsigned flags): type definition for callback passed to uv_udp_recv_start, which is called when the endpoint receives data. - handle: udp handle. - nread: number of bytes that have been received (0 if there is no more data to read. you may discard or repurpose the read buffer. note that 0 may also mean that an empty datagram was received, in this case addr is not null; 0 if a transmission error was detected). - buf: uv_buf_t with the received data. - addr: struct sockaddr containing the address of the sender. can be null. valid for the duration of the callback only. - flags: one or more ored uv_udp_ constants. right now only uv_udp_partial is used. note: the receive callback will be called with nread = 0 and addr = null when there is nothing to read and with nread = 0 and addr = null when an empty udp packet is received. uv_membership: membership type for a multicast address. typedef enum { uv_leave_group = 0, uv_join_group } uv_membership; public members: - size_t uv_udp_tsend_queue_size: number of bytes queued for sending. this field strictly shows how much information is currently queued. - size_t uv_udp_tsend_queue_count: number of send requests currently in the queue awaiting to be processed. - uv_udp_t uv_udp_send_thandle: udp handle where this send request is taking place. see also: the uv_handle_t members also apply. api: - int uv_udp_init(uv_loop_t loop, uv_udp_t handle): initialize a new udp handle. the actual socket is created lazily. returns 0 on success. - int uv_udp_init_ex(uv_loop_t loop, uv_udp_t handle, unsigned int flags): initialize the handle with the specified flags. at the moment, the lower 8 bits of the flags parameter are used as the socket domain. a socket will be created for the given domain. if the specified domain is af_unspec, no socket is created, just like uv_udp_init. new in version 1.7.0. - int uv_udp_open(uv_udp_t handle, uv_os_sock_t sock): opens an existing file descriptor or windows socket as a udp handle (unix only). the only requirement of the sock argument is that it follows the datagram contract (works in unconnected mode, supports sendmsg/recvmsg etc). in other words, other datagram - type sockets like raw sockets or netlink sockets can also be passed to this function. changed in version 1.2.1, the file descriptor is set to non - blocking mode. note: the passed file descriptor or socket is not checked for its type, but it's required that it represents a valid datagram socket. - int uv_udp_bind(uv_udp_t handle, const struct sockaddr addr, unsigned int flags): bind the udp handle to an ip address and port. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - addr: struct sockaddr_in or struct sockaddr_in6 with the address and port to bind to. - flags: indicate how the socket will be bound. uv_udp_ipv6only and uv_udp_reuseaddr are supported. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_getsockname(const uv_udp_t handle, struct sockaddr name, int namelen): get the local ip and port of the udp handle. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init and bound. - name: pointer to the structure to be filled with the address data. in order to support ipv4 and ipv6, struct sockaddr_storage should be used. - namelen: on input it indicates the size of the name field. on output it indicates how much of it was filled. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_membership(uv_udp_t handle, const char multicast_addr, const char interface_addr, uv_membership membership): set membership for a multicast address. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - multicast_addr: multicast address to set membership for. - interface_addr: interface address. - membership: should be uv_join_group or uv_leave_group. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_multicast_loop(uv_udp_t handle, int on): set ip multicast loop flag. makes multicast packets loop back to local sockets. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - on: 1 for on, 0 for off. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_multicast_ttl(uv_udp_t handle, int ttl): set the multicast ttl. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - ttl: 1 through 255. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_multicast_interface(uv_udp_t handle, const char interface_addr): set the multicast interface to send or receive data on. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - interface_addr: interface address. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_broadcast(uv_udp_t handle, int on): set broadcast on or off. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - on: 1 for on, 0 for off. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_set_ttl(uv_udp_t handle, int ttl): set the time to live. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - ttl: 1 through 255. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_send(uv_udp_send_t req, uv_udp_t handle, const uv_buf_t bufs, unsigned int nbufs, const struct sockaddr addr, uv_udp_send_cb send_cb): send data over the udp socket. if the socket has not previously been bound with uv_udp_bind, it will be bound to 0.0.0.0 (the all interfaces ipv4 address) and a random port number. on windows, if the addr is initialized to point to an unspecified address (0.0.0.0), it will be changed to point to localhost. this is done to match the behavior of linux systems. parameters: - req: udp request handle. need not be initialized. - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - bufs: list of buffers to send. - nbufs: number of buffers in bufs. - addr: struct sockaddr_in or struct sockaddr_in6 with the address and port of the remote peer. - send_cb: callback to invoke when the data has been sent out. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). changed in version 1.19.0: added 0.0.0.0 and to localhost mapping. - int uv_udp_try_send(uv_udp_t handle, const uv_buf_t bufs, unsigned int nbufs, const struct sockaddr addr): same as uv_udp_send but won't queue a send request if it can't be completed immediately. returns: - 0: number of bytes sent (it matches the given buffer size). - 0 negative: error code. uv_eagain is returned when the message can't be sent immediately. - int uv_udp_recv_start(uv_udp_t handle, uv_alloc_cb alloc_cb, uv_udp_recv_cb recv_cb): prepare for receiving data. if the socket has not previously been bound with uv_udp_bind, it is bound to 0.0.0.0 (the all interfaces ipv4 address) and a random port number. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. - alloc_cb: callback to invoke when temporary storage is needed. - recv_cb: callback to invoke with received data. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - int uv_udp_recv_stop(uv_udp_t handle): stop listening for incoming datagrams. parameters: - handle: udp handle. should have been initialized with uv_udp_init. returns 0 on success or an error code (0 on failure). - size_t uv_udp_get_send_queue_size(const uv_udp_t handle): returns handle->send_queue_size. new in version 1.19.0. - size_t uv_udp_get_send_queue_count(const uv_udp_t handle): returns handle->send_queue_count. new in version 1.19.0. see also: the uv_handle_t api functions also apply.",

initialization configuration changes. the main configuration changes that you can safely perform on your own post - initialization are the ad hoc search settings. there are two of these, one for specifying whether a particular member should run ad hoc searches only, and another for specifying whether the member currently functioning as the captain should run ad hoc searches only. the captain will not assign scheduled searches to ad hoc members. see configure a cluster member to run ad hoc searches only. you can also temporarily switch to a static captain as a work - around for disaster recovery. see use static captain to recover from loss of majority. caution. do not edit the id attribute in the shclustering stanza. the system sets it automatically. this attribute must conform to the requirements for a valid guid. set the search head cluster label. you usually set the cluster label with the splunk init command when you deploy the cluster. if you did not set it during deployment, you can later set it for the cluster by running this command on any one member: splunk edit shclusterconfig shcluster_label label. you do not need to restart the member after setting the label. note. if you set the label on a cluster member, you must also set it on the deployer. see configure the deployer. the shcluster_label parameter is useful for identifying the cluster in the monitoring console. see set cluster labels in monitoring splunk enterprise. maintain the same configuration settings across all members. the serverconf attributes for search head clustering must have the same values across all members, with these exceptions: mgmt_uri, adhoc_searchhead, replication_portport. if any configuration values other than these ones vary from member to member, then the behavior of the cluster will change depending on which member is currently serving as captain. you do not want that to occur. configuration methods. most of the configuration occurs during initial cluster deployment through the cli splunk init command. to perform further configuration later, you have two choices. use the cli splunk edit shclusterconfig command. edit the shclustering stanza in serverconf directly. it is generally simpler to use the cli. caution. you must make the same configuration changes on all members and then restart them all at approximately the same time. because of the importance of maintaining identical settings across all members, do not use the splunk rollingrestart command to restart, except when changing the captain_is_adhoc_searchhead attribute as described in configure a cluster member to run ad hoc searches only. instead, run the splunk restart command on each member. configure search head clustering with the cli. you can use the cli splunk edit shclusterconfig command to make edits to the shclustering stanza in serverconf. specify each attribute and its configured value as a key - value pair. for example, to edit the adhoc_searchhead attribute: splunk edit shclusterconfig adhoc_searchhead true auth usernamepassword. the cli confirms that the operation was successful and instructs you to restart splunkd. note the following. you can use this command to edit any attribute in the shclustering stanza except the disabled attribute, which turns search head clustering on and off. you can only use this command on a member that has already been initialized. for initial configuration, use splunk init shclusterconfig. configure search head clustering by editing serverconf. you can also change attributes by directly editing serverconf. the search head clustering attributes are located in the shclustering stanza, with one exception. to modify the replication port, use the replication_port stanza. use rolling upgrade. choose the replication factor for the search head cluster. this documentation applies to the following versions of splunk enterprise: 6.50, 6.51, 6.51.612, splunk cloud only 6.52, 6.53, 6.54, 6.55, 6.56, 6.57, 6.58, 6.59, 6.60, 6.61, 6.62, 6.63, 6.64, 6.65, 6.66, 6.67, 6.68, 6.69, 6.610, 6.611, 7.00, 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, 7.04, 7.05, 7.06, 7.07, 7.08, 7.10, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13, 7.14, 7.20, 7.21. configure the search head cluster. key information. initialization -

        "text": "the doubled die variety is one of the most popular die varieties for collectors. because doubled dies are so popular, there is a lot of information out there about these varieties, and they are often seen for sale on internet auction sites such as ebay. unfortunately, not all of the information out there is correct. a frequent misconception about doubled dies is that they are produced when coins are struck twice by the dies. this is definitely not the case. all us coins made for circulation are only struck once, unless there is a mishap in the coining press. even then, the resulting error coins will not be doubled dies. only proof coins are struck more than once, with the number of times that they are struck depending on the alloy of the planchets that will be struck into coins. but even here, the number of times that a proof coin is struck will have. the key to doubled dies lies in the name doubled die. as we have seen, coins are struck by steel rods that bear the design images for the coins that they will be striking. these steel rods are called dies. for a doubled die coin to be produced, the doubled image must be on the die itself, hence the term doubled die. doubled dies occur when there are mishaps in making the dies that will be used to strike the coins. on the how dies are made page of this website, we saw that for most of the mints die - making history, the master design for a coin was transferred to a master hub in a reduction lathe. these have recently been replaced by cnc (computer numerical control) milling machines, but the principal is still the same. the master hub is then used in a hubbing press to create master dies. the master dies are used in a hubbing press to create working hubs, and the working hubs are then used in a hubbing press to create working dies. it is the working dies that are then used to strike the coins in the coining presses. in the wexler die variety files, we define doubled die doubling as doubling produced on hubs or dies as a result of a misalignment of the images on the hub and die at some point during the hubbing process. a more accurate term would be hubbing doubling, but the term doubled die is clearly fixed in our culture and here to stay. the misalignment of the design images may have been when the master hub was squeezing an image onto a master die, when a master die was squeezing an image onto a working hub, or when a working hub. doubled master hubs, reduction lathe doubling, doubled master dies, doubled working hubs. since the vast majority of doubled die varieties that are reported to us are on coins from doubled working dies, that is where we will focus our attention here. because of changes in mint technology for making hubs and dies, the process of making a working die can be divided into two eras. these would be the multiple - squeeze hubbing era and the single - squeeze hubbing era. prior to the use of single - squeeze hubbing presses, which could impress the complete design with a single - squeeze hubbing, the working dies were made in multiple - squeeze hubbing presses. for the first hubbing, a die blank was placed on the bottom of the hubbing chamber. a working hub was locked into the top of the hubbing chamber directly above the die blank. here we see the hubbing chamber of a multiple - squeeze hubbing press. arrows point to the working hub, which is locked into the top of the hubbing chamber. a die blank with the cone - shaped die face is positioned directly below the working hub. this photo is courtesy of arnold margolis and error trends coin magazine. when the press was activated, the working hub was lowered into the die blank with hundreds of tons of pressure. the multiple - squeeze hubbing presses did not allow a deep enough penetration into the working die to make a satisfactory impression in the working die with just one hubbing. the working die had to be removed from the hubbing press and taken to an annealing oven, where it was heat - treated to relax the molecular structure and soften the working die so that it could receive another impression from the working hub. this is an annealing oven that was in use at the philadelphia mint during a coin world - sponsored tour of the philadelphia mint in 1998. when the annealing process was completed, the working die was returned to the hubbing press to receive the next impression. for the second and later hubbings, the setup in the hubbing press was different than that used for the first hubbing. the working die was positioned on the bottom of the hubbing chamber, with the working hub sitting directly on top of it. when activated, the top of the hubbing chamber lowered and again squeezed the working hub into the working die. this photo shows a working die bottom and a working hub top positioned in the hubbing press for the second hubbing. if additional hubbings were needed, the setup between the hub and die in the hubbing press was the same. this photo is courtesy of arnold margolis and error trends coin magazine. the hubbing and annealing processes were repeated until it was determined that a satisfactory image was on the working die. for some of the larger denominations, it may have taken as many as nine or ten hubbings to leave a satisfactory image on the working die. since the working hub and working die were placed into the hubbing chamber manually, there was the possibility that the working hub would not be placed on top of the working die accurately. if there was any kind of misalignment of images between the working hub and the partially completed working die, doubled images would appear on the working die wherever these misalignments occurred. at this point, a doubled die was born, and if that doubled die was put into use to strike coins, all coins struck by that die would show exactly the same doubling. after the production of the famous 1955 lincoln cent die 1 doubled die variety with an extremely strong spread to the doubling, the mint took measures to prevent such widespread doubled dies from ever happening again. they placed lugs around the rim of the dies and hubs so that the images on the hub and partially completed working die would align properly when they were placed in the hubbing chamber. these lugs were raised on the working die, and they were depressed indentations on the working hub. this photo illustrates a working hub that was created for the lincoln cent reverse. if you look carefully, you can see that the images on the face of the working hub are raised and look just like they will appear on the struck coins. the arrows point to grooves along the edge of the hub. the lugs on the working die will fit into these grooves to allow proper alignment of the working hub and the working die when more than one hubbing is needed to complete a satisfactory image on the hub or die being made. this is a working die left for the reverse of the lincoln cent as it appears after being hubbed. notice that the design is reversed from what you will see on the struck coins. though difficult to see in the photo, the design is depressed incuse in the working die. arrows point to the raised areas (lugs) around the rim that align to the grooves of the working hub. to the right of the working die, we can see some more blank steel rods that can be used to make master dies, working hubs, or working dies. in 1969, the mint modified the obverse design for the lincoln cent. as a result of those changes, they experienced difficulty in getting satisfactory impressions in the working dies. to remedy the problem, they removed the lugs from the hubs and dies to allow for deeper penetration of the hub into the die. this did fix the problem and allowed the deeper penetration of the hub into the die, but it opened up the possibility of doubled dies again being created with strong spreads. it didn't take long for the consequences of this decision to be felt. in 1969, a major doubled die was produced for the 1969s lincoln cents. another major doubled die was produced for the 1970s lincoln cents. several doubled dies found their way into production for the 1971 lincoln cents, with two major varieties known for the 1971s proof cents. the dam broke in 1972, and several doubled die varieties were produced for the lincoln cents from all three mints, including a major doubled die for the obverse of the p - mint cents. during this period of time, significant doubled dies. over the years, it has been found that different types of misalignments between the images on the hub and the images on the die could occur. the various types of misalignments produced unique characteristics to the doubling found on the dies. each identifiable type of misalignment of images produced one of the classes of doubled die varieties. all but one of the leading die variety attributers recognize eight distinct classes of doubled die varieties. coppercoins also uses a class ix for doubled die varieties produced on the new single - squeeze hubbing presses. all of the other attributers feel that the doubled die. for more information on the various classes of doubled die varieties, you can click on the following links: class i doubled dies, class ii doubled dies, class iii doubled dies, class iv doubled dies, class v doubled dies, class vi doubled dies, class vii doubled dies, class viii doubled dies. when the mint introduced the single - squeeze hubbing presses on a trial basis around 1985, and then to produce working dies at denver and philadelphia in 1996 and 1997, it had hoped to eliminate doubling produced during the hubbing process. unfortunately for the mint, this did not result, and minor doubled dies are actually being produced more frequently on the new single - squeeze hubbing presses than they were on the older multiple - squeeze hubbing presses. we believe that we know the reason for this. in the older multiple - squeeze hubbing presses, the hub was fixed to the top of the hubbing chamber for the first hubbing. when it descended down into the face of the die, it couldn't move as it made contact with the die as it was locked into the top of the hubbing chamber. in the single - squeeze hubbing presses, the set up is different. the die blank is placed into the well of a collar placed in the bottom of the hubbing chamber. the hub is also placed into the well of the collar so that the face of the hub is resting on the conical point of the top of the die blank. since the diameter of the well in the collar has to exceed the diameter of the die blank and the hub so that the die blank and hub can be inserted into and removed from the collar, and so that. since the hub is slightly tilted at the time the hubbing begins, as it is pushed down into the collar well and into the die blank, it will be forced into a more vertical alignment in the collar well. if there is some resistance to the vertical realignment when the hubbing begins, it may snap back into proper alignment at some point as the hubbing proceeds. hubbing press operators have described a clunking sound that is heard when the hub snaps back into proper alignment. when this happens, there will be a misalignment between the image formed prior to the. this is a photo of a single - squeeze hubbing press in use at the philadelphia mint in 1998. the hubbing press operator is placing one of the collars into the hubbing press. the die blank and working hub will be manually placed into the well of the collar prior to that start of the hubbing. the working die will be inserted first, with the cone - shaped top pointing.",

watching season in the dr starts 14 january and continues through 15 march. sometimes the season extends itself through the end of march. ken de pree, dr1's whale expert, reports on the arrival of the humpback whales and whale - watching season. thousands of humpback whales from the north atlantic migrate to the waters of the dominican republic each winter to mate and give birth. their most popular winter rendezvous is silver bank, the 3,000 - square - kilometer reef system approximately 70 miles north - east of puerto plata. but from there many circulate to other popular areas like humans do at singles bars. one of these gathering places is samana bay. more than 1,500 humpbacks visit the bay, with as many as 300 present at any given time during mating season. the world wildlife fund considers samana bay one of the best places in the world to watch whales. it offers something for everyone - the outer bay is where you might find aggressive males competing for the favors of willing females, and the sheltered inner bay is one of the most important humpback nurseries in the world. mid - january to the end of march is the usual whale - watching season in samana bay; however, the excursions continue as long as enough whales remain. the rest of the year the whales feed in the cold, fish - rich waters of the north atlantic between massachusetts bay and iceland and greenland. summer whale - watching excursions are offered in those areas, but there is no better time than the winter mating season when the male humpbacks, eager to impress the females, are most animated and when newborn calves can be seen swimming alongside their mothers. humpback whales have been wintering near samana for centuries. cave drawings made by the aboriginal inhabitants of los haitises national park, long before columbus arrived, depict the spouting whales. and columbus saw them too, as the log of his travels along the north coast in 1493 makes clear. about humpback whales. humpbacks are air - breathing mammals belonging to the group known as great whales. adults measure 40 - 50 ft (12 - 15 m) and weigh 30 - 40 tons. babies measure 10 - 15 ft (3 - 4.5 m) and weigh 1.5 - 2 tons. when born, they have little blubber (fat) to protect them from the cold water awaiting them in the north, but grow quickly on the rich milk provided by their mother. each day they drink 50 gallons of milk that is 50 - 60% fat and gain 100 pounds, much of which is blubber. by comparison, the milk of a human mother is 2% fat. adult humpbacks are black or dark gray with white patches on the flippers, the belly, and the underside of the tail. at first glance all look alike, but there are differences. the black and white pigmentation on the underside of the tail flukes is the most common means of distinguishing one from another. no two have the same markings, enabling whale scientists to identify humpbacks in the same way humans are by their fingerprints. permanent scars, dorsal fin shape, and other unique markings also help distinguish one from another. no whale species is more active than the humpback, causing herman melville in moby dick to call them the most lighthearted and gamesome of all the whales. and the breeding season is when they are the most animated. among the behaviors that delight whale watchers are: - breaching: whale builds momentum swimming underwater, then launches itself into the air, exposing some or all of its body before crashing back onto the waters surface. - flippering: whale rolls on its side or back, raises one or both flippers, then slaps it/them against the surface. - rolling: horizontal on the surface, the whale rolls between 45 and 60 degrees, perhaps slapping the water with its flippers. - surface active group: two to 20 rowdy males compete aggressively to mate with a fertile female. they may breach, slam heads and bodies, and even draw blood. the humpback whale is also known for its haunting melody, a variety of chirps, yups, grunts, and eooooos that form a song. jacques cousteau called them the carusos of the deep. whales can hear the songs for up to 20 miles; humans can eavesdrop with an underwater listening device called a hydrophone. whale - watching excursions in samana bay. whale - watching excursions can be booked from most hotels in samana or at the city dock area. the boat trip and government fees to enter the whale sanctuary are included in the price and a meal. the excursion can also be booked through a number of tour companies with offices located in all tourist areas. traveling to samana on your own isn't difficult. one option is to rent a car and drive to samana from puerto plata on the north coast, about a four - hour drive. or if you're coming from the south coast (santo domingo), take advantage of the new toll road that will put you in samana in about two hours. the alternative non - toll road from santo domingo to san francisco de macoris, nagua, and sanchez - samana takes about four hours. another option is to drive to sabana de la mar and take a ferry across the bay to samana. both routes. bus travel to samana is another good alternative and much less expensive. from the south coast, caribe tours and metro offer daily bus service from santo domingo to samana. from the north coast, caribe tours has service from puerto plata and sosua. the buses of both companies are large, modern, and air - conditioned. charter flights to samana can also be arranged from any airport and can fly into el catey - arroyo barril (best for samana city) or portillo (best for las terrenas). once in samana, there are many boats to choose from, ranging from 2 - 3 yolas (local fishing boats with no protection from weather or waves, single gasoline outboard motor) to fast launches (largely uncovered, inboard diesel engine or twin outboard motors) to large twin - diesel engine vessels capable of handling 50 - 80 passengers, bathroom, protection from weather. no matter how calm the inner bay looks from the dock, the outer bay - where the whales usually are - is often rough during the winter months. so choice of boat is very important. considerations include boat construction, protection from the weather and wind - blown spray, and height above sea level for visibility at the distances required by whale - watching regulations. the three companies listed below are the recommended choices based on boat size, type of engines, services provided, and adherence to the whale - watching regulations: - victoria marine - whale samana. victoria ii, 50 - 80 passengers, always a whale expert on board (usually kim beddall, founder of whale watching in samana bay), excursions of 3 - 4 hours. 809 538 - 2494. - transporte maritimo minadiel. several vessels all 50 - 80 passengers, occasionally a whale expert on board, excursions of 3 - 4 hours. 809 538 - 2556. - moto marina. fast launches, excursions of 2 hours, rarely a whale expert on board. 809 538 - 2302. samana bay is a marine sanctuary by decree of the dominican government. whale watching tours must by law protect the whales within this sanctuary. among the rules are limits on the number of vessels that can observe a whale at the same time, the minimum distance that must be maintained between vessels and whales (unless a curious whale approaches the boat), speed of travel through the whale area, and the length of time a vessel may spend watching an individual whale. additionally, no vessel may permit passengers to swim with the whales. because captains sometimes violate the regulations, thinking their... what else is going on in samana? as explained above, it is possible to make a day trip to see the whales if staying at another dominican destination. but it is always best to overnight in samana and stay on to enjoy one or two other attractions of this province. lodging is available in samana at a variety of hotels of varying sizes and degrees of luxury. you'll find hotels in the city of samana, las galeras beach, las terrenas, portillo, playa popy, cozon, and playa bonita on the north coast of the peninsula. note that this is a big peninsula. samana is about half an hour from las galeras - playa rincon, while las terrenas is about half an hour from samana and an hour's drive from las galeras. cozon, playa bonita, portillo, and las terrenas are within a 20 - minute range. restaurants are also readily available. to get a feel for samana, see the dr1 samana travel page. while in samana, a visit to the cebse whale - watching museum is well worth the time. on display are the skeleton of a humpback whale, films, recordings of whale songs, and many exhibits. entrance is only rd1000 per person. hours are daily from 9 - 11 am and 2 - 5 pm. additionally, consider booking an excursion to los haitises national park for the second day of your visit. it's a popular day trip. indians inhabited the caves in this park long before the arrival of columbus. as mentioned earlier, drawings on the cave walls in los haitises are testimony that the whales have been wintering here for centuries. trips can be arranged through the same samana companies offering whale watching. for more information on the samana whales, ken de pree is the author of whales of samana available in english, german, french, and spanish. the booklet has 22 pages and more than 30 photos, nearly all taken in the bay of samana. to purchase the booklet, email samana_whales@yahoocom. for further information on travel in samana, samana bay, and whale watching in the bay, see <url> <url> - june_1997/0597feat1_sb2.html, <url> <url> http://whalewheelockedu/movies, <url> <url> ken de pree is also available to answer questions on whales in samana on the travel forum of dr1 at forums.",

        "text": "in techniques, offensive techniques, energy sphere attacks, supernova. english directory: techniques, offensive techniques, energy sphere. frieza has destroyed whole planets with one of these attacks. a huge ki blast. dragon ball xenoverse skill description: supernova (, supanova). alternate names: countdown to the destruction, death blaster, energy sword, sun ball, supernova death ball, supernova sphere, supernova ball. debut: anime - dragon ball z: bardock - the father of goku; manga - the ultimate battle begins. inventor: frieza, future frieza. users: frieza, future frieza, cooler, future cooler, meta - coolers, cell, chilled, ultimate tenkaichi hero, future warrior, future warrior (color or class: energy sphere). similar techniques: 100 death ball, destroy the planet, flaming wahaha no ha, holy wrath, omega blaster, planet burst, repeating death beams, sphere of destruction, god of destructions clever scheme. supernova () is a powerful death ball technique used by frieza and cooler. contents show: overview: the user raises his finger and gathers their energy in the form of a giant yellow - orange sun - like energy sphere. once it is ready, the user launches the attack against the target. like the normal death ball, it is mostly used to destroy planets or as a last - ditch - effort to kill an enemy. usage: frieza fires his supernova. frieza had learned of the saiyans' rapidly growing strength and decided to eradicate them out of fear that they would have the power to become super saiyans and defeat him. when bardock attempts to kill frieza with his final spirit cannon for the murder of his comrades because of frieza's betrayal, the tyrant counters with his supernova. frieza's supernova approaches planet vegeta. the attack destroyed planet vegeta as well as the entire saiyan race and a large percentage of his own soldiers, yet a few saiyans had survived / escaped. the supernova also somehow sent bardock back in time to the time when chilled (frieza's ancestor) ran the frieza force. in the manga version of episode of bardock, frieza and chilled both utilize the regular death ball technique (frieza to destroy planet vegeta and chilled to try to defeat bardock). in the anime version, frieza and chilled use the supernova instead, with chilled using a version of supernova that uses both hands to charge. after future trunks easily blocked mecha frieza's attacks, mecha frieza flies in the air and launches a supernova, attempting to destroy planet earth the same way he previously destroyed planet namek. king kai describes the supernova that frieza uses against future trunks as 10x greater than the death ball used to destroy namek, but the super saiyan catches the attack without harm. annoyed at this act, the cybernetic tyrant fires a blast at the supernova which causes it to explode, but future trunks dodges the blast and while frieza is caught off - guard, future trunks kills him with his shining sword attack. during the tournament of power in dragon ball super, frieza tried using this attack on top, but it was effortlessly disintegrated with a small speck of energy of destruction. film appearances: meta - cooler's supernova in the return of cooler. in dragon ball z: the return of cooler, the first meta - cooler seen on new namek outclassed goku due to his regenerative ability. wanting to end the fight, meta - cooler launched a supernova to kill goku, but goku at the last second teleported away from the blast via instant transmission. variations: coolieza's supernova death blaster: a much smaller variant of the supernova utilized by meta - cooler in video games. countdown to the destruction: a blue variant of the supernova used by frieza. it will explode when it hits anything other than frieza himself. dual supernova (1st form frieza's two - person team attack version of supernova): in which two users attack as a pair with supernova (1st form frieza's dual ultimate attack skill after the 109.00 update in xenoverse 2). supernova cooler: cooler's variant of the supernova utilized with the full hand instead of a single finger and charges faster. dual supernova cooler: cooler's variant of dual supernova which is a two - person team attack version of supernova cooler (final form cooler's dual ultimate attack skill after the 109.00 update in xenoverse 2). super big nova: used by meta - cooler core in dragon ball heroes as his super attack. golden supernova: the most powerful variation of the supernova used by cooler in his golden form. z - assist supernova: used by the future warrior in dragon ball xenoverse when using the supernova while frieza is their current master. during the z - assist, frieza's soul, which appears as an astral projection of first form frieza performing the technique, which overshadows the warrior's body, will go into the warrior and increase the power of their supernova. video game appearances: a meta - cooler prepares a supernova in battle of z. the supernova appears as an ultimate attack for cooler and the meta - coolers in many dragon ball video games such as dragon ball z budokai 3, dragon ball z shin budokai, dragon ball z shin budokai - another road, the budokai tenkaichi series, the raging blast series, dragon ball heroes and dragon ball z battle of z. the attack is frieza's ultimate attack in his first form in dragon ball z ultimate tenkaichi. it also appears as one of frieza's ultimate skills in dragon ball xenoverse and dragon ball xenoverse 2. it appears as mecha frieza's ultimate blast in dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi 3 and the raging blast series. cooler usually announces \"the entire planet will be vaporized\" before launching and detonating it with \"i am the strongest in the universe\", giving heavy damage. frieza uses the supernova in xenoverse. named death blaster, it is a super attack for the meta - coolers in dragon ball z supersonic warriors 2. metal cooler nucleus has his own version of supernova in dragon ball heroes. the supernova appears in the dragon ball collectible card game called energy sword; it either gives 1 damage to the opposing warrior or moves the opposing warrior to its owners deployment area. if used by a cooler family card, the user gets thrash 1 until the end of the turn. the one used by frieza to destroy planet vegeta appears colored white and blue under the name countdown to the destruction in the dragon ball collectible card game; the sphere detonates when it hits anything other than frieza and it allows the user to search for one technique in the top 5 cards of their planet and then shuffle their planet. in dragon ball xenoverse, it is first form frieza's ultimate skill. cell can also perform the supernova as an ultimate skill and the future warrior can learn it from frieza by completing frieza's training as their master. if frieza is the future warrior's current master and they use the supernova, it will receive a z - assist making it more powerful. in dragon ball z dokkan battle, supernova appears as first form frieza's super attack when he is in his hoverchair. it is also used by final form cooler, meta - cooler and coolieza. in dragon ball xenoverse 2, the supernova returns as an ultimate skill used by 1st form frieza in all three of his skillsets and by cell (perfect) in his perfect 2 skillset. it can also be obtained by the future warrior as a reward in expert mission 06: the depths of despair. additionally, cooler has his own version which can be used by cooler in all his forms including meta - cooler. as part of the masters pack dlc, future warrior can learn supernova cooler by completing school quest lesson 3 of cooler's training. bardock throwing his riot javelin as frieza creates his supernova in the opening prologue of xenoverse 2. in the opening prologue, a altered timeline of age 737 where bardock has visions of frieza's revenge in age 779 before frieza starts creating his supernova, bardock tries to destroy frieza with his riot javelin, but it is consumed by frieza's supernova and bardock is seemingly killed. however, in the masked saiyan saga, it is revealed that towa and mira abducted bardock from age 737 using a wormhole as he was about to be consumed. however, bardock escaped and fled into the past were before he was recaptured and turned into the masked saiyan. an ultimate attack requires the ultimate partner. attack as a pair with a supernova. dragon ball xenoverse 2 dual supernova skill description. after the 109.00 update, two new team attack variations of supernova appear, each as a dual ultimate attack skill for 1st form frieza and final form cooler. frieza's appears as dual supernova, a team attack version of frieza's supernova. cooler's appears as dual supernova cooler, a team attack version of supernova cooler. both skills can be learned by the future warrior after achieving partner level maximum friendship with frieza for dual supernova and cooler for dual supernova cooler as instructors, then speak to them to learn their specific dual ultimate. \"it appears you have mastered the skills necessary to fight as my subordinate. but i do not require the simple service of an underling. no, you must be capable of fighting at my side. indeed, right at my side. mm. now why don't we give that a try. heh heh heh, it should make for quite the amusing little game.\" frieza before teaching his dual ultimate in dragon ball xenoverse 2. frieza will notice they have mastered the skills necessary to fight as his subordinate though admits he does not need them to be his underling and instead wishes to have them fight by his side which he thinks will be an amusing little game causing him to teach them dual supernova. both frieza and cooler can equip their dual ultimate via partner customization, but only require it to be in their skillset in order to initiate it as they can perform their dual ultimates' secondary assist attack regardless of the skills they have equipped, though frieza can only perform his. in dragon ball fighterz, as part of the bardock pack dlc, if bardock kos frieza with a neutral heavy attack on the space stage, a dramatic finish will trigger where frieza will retaliate with a supernova which causes a reenactment of bardock's death scene from the tv special where he has a vision of goku facing frieza on namek and smiles as he is about to be consumed. however, bardock manages to wake up from the vision, refusing to die and powers up, destroying the supernova completely instead of bring consumed before swearing he will avenge the saiyans, transforming into a super saiyan and firing a final spirit cannon. if frieza kos bardock with a vanish as his neutral heavy attack, is incapable of the knockback necessary to trigger it on the space stage, a dramatic finish will trigger where bardock will retaliate with final spirit cannon which causes a reenactment of bardock's death scene from the tv special where his attack is consumed by frieza's supernova and he has a vision of goku facing frieza on namek and smiles as he is about to be consumed by the attack screaming \"kakarot\" as he dies. the only differences are that frieza is in his final form both when he. trivia: the supernova featured in the episode the end of vegeta is not as big as the one in the tv special dragon ball z: bardock - the father of goku. when preformed by perfect cell in xenoverse and xenoverse 2, he will say \"this one's a little frieza ditty. take this.\" gallery: frieza uses his supernova in the manga. frieza prepares his supernova. frieza prepares his supernova. frieza's supernova. frieza launches his supernova. frieza's supernova approaches bardock. frieza's supernova hits soldiers. frieza's supernova destroys planet vegeta. frieza fires his supernova (trailer version). mecha frieza charging a supernova. meta -

        "text": "technology acceptance model navigation. based on the theory of reasoned action (davis, 1986), developed the technology acceptance model, which deals more specifically with the prediction of the acceptability of an information system. the purpose of this model is to predict the acceptability of a tool and to identify the modifications which must be brought to the system in order to make it acceptable to users. this model suggests that the acceptability of an information system is determined by two main factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. perceived usefulness is defined as being the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will improve his performance. perceived ease of use refers to the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will be effortless. several factorial analyses demonstrated that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use can be considered as two different dimensions (hauser et shugan, 1980; larcker et lessig, 1980; swanson, 1987). as demonstrated in the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model postulates that the use of an information system is determined by the behavioral intention, but on the other hand, that the behavioral intention is determined by the person's attitude towards the use of the system and also by his perception of its utility. according to davis, the attitude of an individual is not the only factor that determines his use of a system, but is also based on the impact which it may have on his performance. therefore, even if an employee does not welcome an information system. technology acceptance model from davis, bagozzi et warshaw (1989). according to davis (1986), perceived ease of use also influences in a significant way the attitude of an individual through two main mechanisms: self - efficacy and instrumentality. self - efficacy is a concept developed by bandura (1982), which explains that the more a system is easy to use, the greater should be the user's sense of efficacy. moreover, a tool that is easy to use will make the user feel that he has a control over what he is doing (lepper, 1985). efficacy is one of the main factors underlying intrinsic motivation (bandura, 1982; lepper, 1985), and it is what illustrates here the direct link between perceived ease of use and attitude. perceived ease of use can also contribute in an instrumental way in improving a person's. it is however interesting to note that the research presented by davis (1989) to validate his model demonstrates that the link between the intention to use an information system and perceived usefulness is stronger than perceived ease of use. according to this model, we can therefore expect that the factor which influences the most a user is the perceived usefulness of a tool. although the initial tam model was empirically validated, it explained only a fraction of the variance of the outcome variable it usage (from 4 to 45 according to mcfarland and hamilton, 2006). therefore, many authors have refined the initial model, trying to find the latent factors underlying perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in tam2. venkatesh, davis (2000) showed that social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntarity, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demontrability) affected perceived usefulness and intention to use. a notable refinment of the tam model is proposed by mc farland and hamilton (2006) (figure 2. adding contextual specificity to the technology acceptance model from mcfarland, hamilton, 2006). the results comforted the research model, showing that system usage was directly and significantly affected by task structure, prior experience, others' use, organizational support, anxiety and system quality. mediation effect were also shown as predicted. thus, however, for some relations, the effect went in the opposite direction from expected, like others' use lowering computer efficacy or high - quality systems linked to low frequency of use. in sum, the initial model or its extension does not completely accounts for the observed variance in system usage. however, the models all agree that computer efficacy affects perceived ease of use, which in turns is strongly related to perceived usefulness. see also: theory of reasoned action; theory of planned behaviour; usability and user experience surveys. references: bandura, a.

white. maormers' skin is entirely pale and colorless, as though their flesh is made of white limpid jelly. their skin also has strange chameleon - like properties, comparable to that of the forest - coupling skills of the wood elves. culture king orgnum is the maormer ruler of pyandonea. orgnum is a deathless wizard who, it seems, is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century, and he is said to be the serpent god satakal. the maormer practice a powerful form of snake magic, and with this they have tamed the sea serpents of their island for use as steeds and warbeasts. these sea serpents serve as king orgnum's guards and occasional mounts. maormeri ships are described as insectoid in appearance, with membranous sails and a rugged chitin hull, flying a markedly alien flag. waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the maormers' own ships in the uncharted waters of pyandonea. history origins like the high elves, the sea elves also came from old aldmeris. but where the altmer settled in the paradise of summerset, the maormer ended up in low, marshy, and insect - infested pyandonea, and the sea elves have never forgiven the high elves for it. stormwarden undercroft loading screen src. translations of tapestries in the crystal tower are the most reliable origin story for the maormer, and tell the tale of how the maormer were likely separated in their original homeland of aldmeris. according to this story, orgnum was a massively rich aldmer nobleman who used his wealth to rebel against the governments and powers of aldmeris. he and his followers were exilled from aldmeris to a place where they could not take such actions again via impenetrable mist, pyandonea, the veil of mist. this proved successful as they never assaulted aldmeris again and became the maormer. first second era the maormer were relentless in their drive to conquer summerset, and there is scarcely a year throughout the first or second era when they did not ravage the coastlines of the altmer. every attack launched by the maormer against summerset has been led by orgnum himself, and despite the number of wars and strategies employed by the maormer, each of these attacks has proved to be an ultimate failure. in the year 2e 486, a small maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of alinor, and king hidellith ordered his navy to give chase. the navy followed the ships through uncharted waters into an ambush in pyandonea itself. most of the alinori navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to summerset, a testament to the maritime genius of the altmer. during the three banners war in 2e 582, the maormer had some form of control over the elsweyr island khenarthis roost under a treaty they agreed to with the city of mistral. ulondil, the maormer ambassador of the island, along with his followers, later went on to betray the agreement. the sea vipers, a powerful faction of maormer, was known to have also led attacks against the first aldmeri dominion throughout many of its controlled territories. the second aldmeri dominion made allies of the maormer, although the dominion allowed the kings of colovia to eliminate maormer outposts that had been established along the western coast of the mainland. third era the last documented appearance of the maormer was the war of the isle in the year 3e 110. the united alliance of the kings of summerset, antiochus septim, and the psijic order, combining the imperial fleet, the royal navies of summerset, and the psijics' magical powers, succeeded in destroying the pyandonean invading armada. it was said that the storm brewed by the psijic of artaeum so annihilated orgnum's fleet that he was never again able to muster together enough of a force to dare another battle. known maormer angalmo, a respected geographer who detailed tempest island. arstul, irinwe, sea viper captain. chryseis, aryaamo, embassy clerk. despina, heculon, admiral who wrote the maormer memo. iphidamas, ohmanil, commodore on tempest island. orgnum, king of the maormer and pyandonea. pelius, uldor, powerful centuries -

        "text": "home networking: lan switching - first step, layer 2 switching methods. lan switches are characterized by the forwarding method that they support, such as a store - and - forward switch, cut - through switch, or fragment - free switch. in the store - and - forward switching method, error checking is performed against the frame, and any frame with errors is discarded. with the cut - through switching method, no error checking is performed against the frame, which makes forwarding the frame through the switch faster than store - and - forward switches. store - and - forward switching store - and - forward switching means that the lan switch copies each complete frame into the switch memory buffers and computes a cyclic redundancy check (crc) for errors. crc is an error - checking method that uses a mathematical formula based on the number of bits (1s) in the frame to determine whether the received frame is errored. if a crc error is found, the frame is discarded. if the frame is error - free, the switch forwards the frame out the appropriate interface port, as illustrated in figure 67. figure 67: store - and - forward switch discarding a frame with a bad crc. view full - size image. an ethernet frame is discarded if it is smaller than 64 bytes in length (a runt) or if the frame is larger than 1518 bytes in length (a giant), as illustrated in figure 68. figure 68: runts and giants in the switch. view full - size image. note: some switches can be configured to carry giant or jumbo frames. if the frame does not contain any errors and is not a runt or a giant, the lan switch looks up the destination address in its forwarding or switching table and determines the outgoing interface. it then forwards the frame toward its intended destination. store - and - forward switching operation store - and - forward switches store the entire frame in internal memory and check the frame for errors before forwarding the frame to its destination. store - and - forward switch operation ensures a high level of error - free network traffic because bad data frames are discarded rather than forwarded across the network, as illustrated in figure 69. figure 69: store - and - forward switch examining each frame for errors before forwarding to destination network segment. view full - size image. the store - and - forward switch shown in figure 69 inspects each received frame for errors before forwarding it on to the frame's destination network segment. if a frame fails this inspection, the switch drops the frame from its buffers, and the frame is thrown into the proverbial bit bucket. a drawback to the store - and - forward switching method is one of performance because the switch has to store the entire data frame before checking for errors and forwarding. this error checking results in high switch latency (delay). if multiple switches are connected with the data being checked at each switch point, total network performance can suffer as a result. another drawback to store - and - forward switching is that the switch requires more memory and processor (central processing unit, cpu) cycles to perform the detailed inspection of each frame than that of cut - through or fragment - free switching. cut - through switching with cut - through switching, the lan switch copies into its memory only the destination mac address, which is located in the first 6 bytes of the frame following the preamble. the switch looks up the destination mac address in its switching table, determines the outgoing interface port, and forwards the frame on to its destination through the designated switch port. a cut - through switch reduces delay because the switch begins to forward the frame as soon as it reads the destination mac address and determines the outgoing switch port, as illustrated in figure 610. figure 610: cut - through switch examining each frame header before forwarding to destination network segment. view full - size image. the cut - through switch shown in figure 610 inspects each received frame's header to determine the destination before forwarding on to the frame's destination network segment. frames with and without errors are forwarded in cut - through switching operations, leaving the error detection of the frame to the intended recipient. if the receiving switch determines the frame is errored, the frame is thrown out to the bit bucket, where the frame is subsequently discarded from the network. cut - through switching was developed to reduce the delay in the switch processing frames as they arrive at the switch and are forwarded on to the destination switch port. the switch pulls the frame header into its port buffer. when the destination mac address is determined by the switch, the switch forwards the frame out the correct interface port to the frame's intended destination. cut - through switching reduces latency inside the switch. if the frame was corrupted in transit, however, the switch still forwards the bad frame. the destination receives this bad frame, checks the frame's crc, and discards it, forcing the source to resend the frame. this process wastes bandwidth, and if it occurs too often, network users experience a significant slowdown on the network. in contrast, store - and - forward switching prevents errored frames from being forwarded across the network and provides for quality of service (qos), managing network traffic flow. note: today's switches don't suffer the network latency that older, legacy switches labored under. this minimizes the effect switch latency has on your traffic. today's switches are better suited for a store - and - forward environment. cut - through switching operation cut - through switches do not perform any error checking of the frame because the switch looks only for the frame's destination mac address and forwards the frame out the appropriate switch port. cut - through switching results in low switch latency. the drawback, however, is that bad data frames as well as good frames are sent to their destinations. at first blush, this might not sound bad because most network cards do their own frame checking by default to ensure good data is received. you might find that if your network is broken down into workgroups, the likelihood of bad frames or collisions. fragment - free switching fragment - free switching is also known as runt - less switching and is a hybrid of cut - through and store - and - forward switching. fragment - free switching was developed to solve the late - collision problem. note: recall that when two systems' transmissions occur at the same time, the result is a collision. collisions are a part of ethernet communications and do not imply any error condition. a late collision is similar to an ethernet collision except that it occurs after all hosts on the network should have been able to notice that a host was already transmitting. a late collision indicates that another system attempted to transmit after a host has transmitted at least the first 60 bytes of its frame. late collisions are often caused by an ethernet lan being too large and therefore needing to be segmented. late collisions can also be caused by faulty network devices on the segment and duplex (for example, half - duplex/full - duplex mismatches) between connected devices. fragment - free switching operation fragment - free switching works like cut - through switching with the exception that a switch in fragment - free mode stores the first 64 bytes of the frame before forwarding. fragment - free switching can be viewed as a compromise between store - and - forward switching and cut - through switching. the reason fragment - free switching stores only the first 64 bytes of the frame is that most network errors and collisions occur during the first 64 bytes of a frame. note: different methods work better at different points in the network. for example, cut - through switching is best for the network core where errors are fewer and speed is of utmost importance. store - and - forward is best at the network access layer where most network problems and users are located. layer 3 switching layer 3 switching is another example of fragment - free switching. up to now, this discussion has concentrated on switching and bridging at the data link layer (layer 2) of the open system interconnection (osi) model. when bridge technology was first developed, it was not practical to build wire - speed bridges with large numbers of high - speed ports because of the manufacturing cost involved. with improved technology, many functions previously implemented in software were moved into the hardware, increasing performance and enabling manufacturers to build reasonably priced wire - speed switches. whereas bridges and switches work at the data link layer (osi layer 2), routers work at the network layer (osi layer 3). routers provide functionality beyond that offered by bridges or switches. as a result, however, routers entail greater complexity. like early bridges, routers were often implemented in software running on a special - purpose processing platform, such as a personal computer (pc) with two network interface cards (nics) and software to route data between each nic, as illustrated in figure 611. figure 611: pc routing with two nics. view full - size image. the early days of routing involved a computer and two nic cards, not unlike two people having a conversation but having to go through a third person to do so. the workstation would send its traffic across the wire, and the routing computer would receive it on one nic, determine that the traffic would have to be sent out the other nic, and then resend the traffic out this other nic. note: in the same way that a layer 2 switch is another name for a bridge, a layer 3 switch is another name for a router. this is not to say that a layer 3 switch and a router operate the same way. layer 3 switches make decisions based on the port - level internet protocol (ip) addresses, whereas routers make decisions based on a map of the layer 3 network maintained in a routing table. multilayer switching is a switching technique that switches at both the data link (osi layer 2) and network (osi layer 3) layers. to enable multilayer switching, lan switches must use store - and - forward techniques because the switch must receive the entire frame before it performs any protocol layer operations, as illustrated in figure 612. figure 612: layer 3 multilayer switch examining each frame for error before determining the destination network segment based on the network address. view full - size image. similar to a store - and - forward switch, with multilayer switching, the switch pulls the entire received frame into its memory and calculates its crc. it then determines whether the frame is good or bad. if the crc calculated on the packet matches the crc calculated by the switch, the destination address is read, and the frame is forwarded out the correct switch port. if the crc does not match the frame, the frame is discarded. because this type of switching waits for the entire frame to be received before forwarding, port latency times can become high, which can result in some latency. layer 3 switching operation you might be asking yourself, \"what's the difference between a layer 3 switch and a router?\" the fundamental difference between a layer 3 switch and a router is that layer 3 switches have optimized hardware, passing data traffic as fast as layer 2 switches. however, layer 3 switches make decisions regarding how to transmit traffic at layer 3, just as a router does. note: within the lan environment, a layer 3 switch is usually faster than a router because it is built on switching hardware. bear in mind that the layer 3 switch is not as versatile as a router, so do not discount the use of a router in your lan without first examining your lan requirements, such as the use of network address translation (nat). before going forward with this discussion, recall the following points: a switch is a layer 2 data link device with physical ports, and that the switch communicates via frames that are placed on to the wire at layer 1 (physical). a router is a layer 3 network device that communicates with other routers with the use of packets, which in turn are encapsulated inside frames. routers have interfaces for connection into the network medium. for a router to route data over the ethernet, for instance, the router requires an ethernet interface, as illustrated in figure 613. figure 613: router interfaces. a serial interface is required for the router connecting to a wide - area network (wan), and a token ring interface is required for the router connecting to a token ring network. a simple network made up of two network segments and an internetworking device (in this case, a router) is shown in figure 614. figure 614: two - segment network with a layer 3 router. the router in figure 614 has two ethernet interfaces labeled e0 and e1. the primary function of the router is determining the...",

resistant varieties; eliminate competition from weeds; keep the plant growing vigorously with proper water and nutrients; keep the garden clean of plant debris; rotate crops; space plants for maximum air circulation; monitor for pests. failure to follow one or more of these steps can lead to pest problems. to manage pests, identify the source of the problem by assessing the symptoms. the key in table 1 will help you narrow down the cause. it is organized by affected plant parts (leaves, stems, roots and fruit). figure 1 phosphorous deficiency. figure 2 psyllid damage. figure 3 evidence of flea beetles. figure 4 tomato hornworm. figure 5 symptoms of early blight. figure 6 aphids. common tomato problems. phosphorus deficiencies (figure 1) occur early in the growing season when soil is still cool. phosphorus is abundant in our soils but may be unavailable to the plant when the soil is too cold. don't plant tomatoes too early in the season. use plastic mulch to warm the soil. once soil temperatures rise, the problem usually corrects itself. curly top virus is transmitted by the beet leafhopper. this problem is common in western colorado but seldom found in eastern colorado. infected plants turn yellow and stop growing. upper leaflets roll and develop a purplish color, especially along the veins. leaves and stems become stiff, fruit ripens prematurely. it is difficult to control because leafhoppers migrate from southern areas. hot, dry springs with predominantly southwest winds usually indicate increased problems with this disease. no chemical controls are effective. use row covers to protect tomato plants from the leafhopper. psyllids (figure 2) are more commonly found in eastern colorado and are seldom a problem in western colorado. they feed on tomato or potato plant sap and inject a toxic saliva that causes the characteristic psyllid yellows. leaves turn yellow, veins often turn purple. stems may become distorted, giving the bush a zigzag appearance. to confirm psyllids, check the undersides of leaves for nymphs. nymphs are about the size of an aphid. at first they are yellow, then they turn green. they are sedentary while feeding and secrete small white granules that resemble sugar. for best control, dust the foliage, especially potato and tomato psyllids. flea beetles (figure 3) are small, black or brown beetles that jump when disturbed. the adults chew small holes or pits in leaves. wounded tissue may be more susceptible to diseases such as early blight. most plants outgrow flea beetle damage. insecticides such as cabaryl or permethrin are effective controls if needed. see 5592 flea beetles. tomato or tobacco hornworms (figure 4) are large, green or gray - green caterpillars with white to tan v - shaped or dashed markings on their sides. a green to reddish horn protrudes from the hind end. they are voracious feeders, stripping leaves from stems and even eating unripe fruit. pick them off by hand. the caterpillars are susceptible to bacillus thuringiensis (bt) as well as to many common vegetable insecticides. early blight (alternaria leaf spot, figure 5) is caused by the fungus alternaria solani. symptoms become prevalent during the hotter months. this disease produces brown to black, target - like spots on older leaves. if severe, the fungus also attacks stems and fruit. affected leaves may turn yellow, then drop, leaving the fruit exposed to sunburn. sanitation is the best control. remove all diseased plant tissue on the ground as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris. do not plant tomatoes in the same place next year. space plants farther apart to improve air circulation. avoid overhead irrigation. if the infestation is heavy, sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection. septoria leaf spot is less common in colorado than early blight. it too is a fungal disease. characteristic symptoms are white or gray spots on leaves surrounded by a black or brown margin. control is similar to early blight. whiteflies and aphids (figure 6) both cause leaf yellowing and leave a characteristic sticky excrement called honeydew. leaves appear shiny and are somewhat sticky when honeydew is present. damage usually is minimal on tomatoes and often can be ignored. if aphids become a problem, some applications of insecticidal soap are quite effective. cucumber mosaic virus and herbicide injury are almost impossible to tell apart without previous knowledge of chemicals applied or laboratory confirmation. cucumber mosaic virus causes tomato plants to yellow and become bushy and stunted. leaves may be mottled. the virus most often is carried in tomato seeds. mechanical transmission by workers touching plants and movement by aphid carriers can occur, but this is much less common in tomatoes than in cucurbits. remove and destroy plants. there are no chemical controls. figure 7 fusarium wilt. fusarium wilt and fusarium crown rot symptoms (figure 7) begin as yellowing of older leaves. with fusarium crown rot, the leaves often turn brown or black and eventually wilt. with fusarium wilt, the yellow leaves turn downward and droop. fusarium oxysporum, the cause of both diseases, is a common tomato fungus that lives in the plants' vascular system, which carries water from the roots to the leaves. to see if either of these diseases is present: check watering practices. both over - and underwatering can mimic disease symptoms. check the roots. discolored roots indicate root rot. cut the lower or main stem and look inside at the vascular tissue. fusarium wilt causes a dark brown discoloration within the vascular tissue. fusarium crown rot causes a rot or canker at the base of the stem and possibly a root rot. most tomato seeds or transplants are labeled with a code such as vfn, vfna, vfnt, etc. this indicates that the plants are resistant to verticillium wilt (v), fusarium wilt (f), southern root - knot nematode (n), early blight (a) or tobacco tomato mosaic virus (t). verticillim wilt and root knot nematodes rarely cause a problem in colorado, but if you have had a fusarium wilt problem in the past, it would be a good idea to choose a variety labeled f. do not plant tomatoes, potatoes or eggplant in the affected area for two or three years. no fungicides are labeled for. figure 8 bacterial canker. figure 9 tomato spotted wilt - impatiens necrotic spot. bacterial canker (figure 8) occurs sporadically in colorado. symptoms begin with lower leaves turning downward. dark to light brown streaks may develop on the leaf midribs and eventually extend down the petiole to form a canker on the stem. there may be vascular discoloration. symptoms on fruit are small, white, scabby, raised lesions, often described as birds - eye. this disease is difficult to distinguish from other tomato diseases and may need laboratory confirmation. if identified, destroy the plants. do not compost plant material. do not plant tomatoes, potatoes or eggplant in the same soil for two to three years. tomato spotted wilt - impatiens necrotic spot (tospoviruses tswv or insv, figure 9) has traditionally been a problem in commercial tomato production. recently, however, the disease has increasingly been found in home gardens. symptoms begin as dark brown to purple spots on leaves. the dark areas spread to stems, forming cankers. stem streaking also may be noticed. wilting symptoms gradually develop as the disease spreads. however, the leaf tissue is stiff, not limp. the most noticeable symptoms are yellow rings or spots on fruit. fruit may be distorted. tswv and insv are moved from plant to plant by western flower thrips. the only way to manage the disease. greenhouse plant viruses. tswv/insv. root rot can be caused by several fungi. however, poor soil drainage and overwatering are always involved. for home gardeners, control of a potential root - rotting fungus is almost impossible. therefore, management of root rot requires soil improvement, proper watering and rotation of tomatoes. plant tomatoes and related species in the same garden spot only once every three years. figure 10 catfacing. figure 11 blossom end rot. figure 12 sunscald on tomato fruit. catfacing (figure 10) is a term that describes tomato fruit that is misshapen with scars and holes in the blossom end. the cause is thought to be cold weather during blossoming and perhaps high levels of nitrogen. to manage it, avoid setting out transplants too early in the season. blossom end rot (figure 11) begins as light tan, water - soaked lesions on the blossom end of the fruit. these lesions enlarge and turn black and leathery. the cause is thought to be a combination of cold temperatures or excessive heat during blossom set and fluctuations in water supply. when these two factors occur simultaneously, calcium often becomes unavailable to the plant. hence, a calcium deficiency occurs during fruit formation. to manage the problem, fertilize and water properly. avoid setting out transplants too early in the season. use mulch to help reduce fluctuations in moisture levels. stink bugs cause spots and internal damage to tomato fruit by their feeding. adults are shield - shaped and brown or green with red, pink or yellow markings. they release an offensive odor when handled. control weeds around the tomato patch as these insects overwinter in such areas. stink bug damage on green fruit appears as dark pinpricks surrounded by a light discolored area. as fruit ripens, these spots may remain green or turn yellow. the tissue underneath is white and spongy. cavities may form under the damaged skin. sunscald (figure 12) is common on fruit exposed to too much sun. this problem often occurs when infestations of hornworms are high and defoliation or pruning of leaves is heavy. to help control sunscald, shade the plant and reduce the fruits' exposure to the sun. green - yellow shoulders develop on ripening fruit, possibly due to high temperatures. chlorophyll in this area is slow to break down and results in a patch that remains green or turns yellow but not red. this problem may affect the entire shoulder or only a small, irregular patch. shade the plant and take other precautions to reduce the fruits' exposure to the sun. table 1 key to the identification of tomato problems. leaves. purple leaves. leaves with purple veins and overall purplish tint. early season, cool temperatures. no insects present. phosphorus deficiency. leaflets roll upward and develop a purplish color, especially along the veins. curly top virus. yellowed leaves. slight distortion, purpling of veins. zigzag stem and branching pattern. check underside of leaves for insects. psyllids, infected plants turn yellow and soon stop growing. curly top virus. small holes, approximately 0.5 mm. flea beetle. chewing injury on leaves. tomato -

        "text": "lifes blood class notes rh system history in 1939, hemolytic disease of the newborn was first described by levine and stetson. the cause of hemolytic disease of the cause was not specifically identified, but maternal antibody suspected. a year later (1940), karl landsteiner and alexander wiener injected animals with rhesus monkey cells to produce an antibody which reacted with 85% of human red cells, which they named anti - rh. within a year, levine made connection between maternal antibody causing hdn and anti - rh. between 1943 - 45, the other common antigens of the rh system were identified. for many years, the exact inheritance of the rh factors were debated. weiner promoting rh and hr terminology and fisher - race utilizing dccee for the various rh antigens. in 1993, tippett discovered true mode of rh inheritance using molecular diagnostics. rh antigens d (rh o) is the most important antigen after a and b antigens. unlike the anti - a and anti - b antibodies, anti - d antibodies are only seen if a patient lacking d antigen is exposed to d cells. the exposure of d cells usually occurs through pregnancy or transfusion. there are 5 principle antigens that may be found in most individuals. they are: d (found in 85% of the population), c (found in 70% of the population), e (found in 30% of the population), c (found in 80% of the population), e (found in 98% of the population), d (which has never been identified but refers to the 15% of the population who has no d antigen). there are at over 50 rh antigens that have been identified, including those that are either combinations of these antigens or weak expressions of the above antigens, but most rh problems are due to d, c, e, c or e. alleles the common alleles are: c and c are alleles with c w occasionally seen as a weaker expression of c; e and e are alleles, although e is seen only a third as often as e. the e antigen is referred to as a high - incidence antigen since it is found in 98% of the population. d and the lack of d or d are alleles. characteristics of rh antigens the rh antigens together are proteins of 417 amino acids. these proteins cross the red cell membrane 12 times. there are only small loops of the protein on the exterior of the cell membrane. therefore, the rh antigens are not as available to react with their specific antibodies and there are fewer antigen sites than abo. unlike the abo system, the rh antigens are not soluble and are not expressed on the tissues. they are well developed at birth and therefore can easily cause hemolytic disease of the newborn if the baby has a rh antigen that the mother lacks. besides the antigens being well - developed at birth, they are very good immunogens. this is especially true to d which if the most immunogenic after a and b antigens. rh antibodies unlike the abo antibodies that are mainly igm, the rh antibodies are commonly igg. they are not naturally occurring and therefore are formed by immune stimulus due to transfusions or baby's red blood cells during pregnancy. the most common antibody to form is anti - d in rh negative individuals. since rh antibodies are igg, they bind best at 37 o c and their reactions will be observed with the indirect antiglobulin technique. agglutination reactions are enhanced by high protein albumin, low - ionic strength saline (liss), proteolytic enzymes (ficin) and polytheylene glycol (peg). rh antibodies will react more strongly with homozygous cells than with heterozygous cells. for example, an anti - e will react with strongly with ee cells and more weakly with ee cells. this is called dosage. both hemolytic disease of the newborn and hemolytic transfusion reactions can occur due the various rh antibodies. anti - d has been the biggest concern since it was recognized in the 1940s as being the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn. since the d antigen is so immunogenic, we screen all donor units for the d antigen. therefore, if an individual is a +, it means both the a and the d antigens are present. on the other hand, if an individual is a -, the a antigen is present and the d antigen is absent. to prevent problems due to anti - d, we try to always give rh - negative individuals rh - negative blood and we give rh o immune globulin to rh - negative mothers to prevent the formation of anti - d during pregnancy. the incidence of rh antibodies - anti - d most common antibody seen in rhd negative people. - anti - e most common antibody seen in rh pos people since only 30% of the population have the antigen. - anti - c or anti - c less common, most people have the antigen. - anti - e often seen as autoantibody and will make it difficult to find compatible blood since 98% of the population have the e antigen. - anti - ce or anti - ce often seen in combination. if a patient lacks both a c and e and has made an anti - c, then enhancement techniques should be done to make sure that an anti - e is not also present. rh system inheritance from the 1940s to the 1990s, the mechanism for inheritance of the rh blood group system was in question. the terminology that is part of the fisher - race theory is most commonly used even today. fisher - race theory the fisher - race theory involved the presence of 3 separate genes d, c and e and their alleles c and e and the absence of d (since an anti - d has never been found). these three genes are closely linked on the same chromosome and are inherited as a group of 3. the most common group of 3 genes inherited is cde and ce. d negative is the second most common. weiner theory weiner believed there was one gene complex with a number of alleles resulting in the presence of various rh antigens. according to weiner, there were 8 alleles (r o, r 1, r 2, r z, r, r', r\", r y) which ended up with different antigens on the red cells that he called rh o, rh, rh', hr, hr'. weiner terminology is not use as often today, but you will often see rh o (d) when a person considered to be rh - positive. at times, the gene terms are easier to use than fisher - race. if a person has the fisher - race genotype of dcedce, it is easier to refer to that type as r 1 r 1. 2 made up of combinations of genetic products tippett theory in 1986, tippett predicted that there are two closely - linked genes rhd and rhce. the rhd gene determines whether the d antigen that spans the membrane is present. caucasians who are d negative have no gene at that gene loci. in the japanese, chinese and blacks of african descent have an inactive or partial gene at this site. the rhce gene determines c, c, e, e antigens produced from the alleles rhce, rhce, rhce, rhce. rh gene complexes antigens, possible combinations and percentages haplotypes, genes present, antigens present, phenotype, percentage r 1: rhd, rhce, dce, r 1, 42% r: rhce, dce, r, 37% r 2: rhd, rhce, dce, r 2, 14% r o: rhd, rhce (more common in blacks), dce, r o, 4% r': rhce, dce, r', 2% r\": rhce, dce, r\", 1% r z: rhd, rhce, dce, r z, 1% r y: rhce, dce, r y, 1% translating from wiener to fisher - race there are times when you will need to convert weiner to fisher - race or vice versa. it will be easier to do these conversions if you remember the following: r always refers to d whether it is r o, r 1, r 2 or the very rare r z; r always refers to the lack of d; o refers to having no c or e; 1 or always refers to c; 2 or always refers to e. the very rare haplotypes that have both a c and e are given letters from the end of the alphabet (z and y). determining genotypes from phenotypes the following steps will be helpful in determining from the individuals phenotype. these rules are based on probability, so the least likely genotypes will involve r z or r y. - type patient for the five rh antigens (d, c, c, e, e). - start with d, is it positive or negative? if negative, the individual will be homozygous d. if positive for d, you can't tell yet whether the individual is homozygous or heterozygous for d. therefore, put d on just one chromosome. - look at c, is it positive or negative? if negative, put c on each chromosome. if positive, look at c result to determine if the c is homozygous or heterozygous. if there is no c present, there would be two c and it would be homozygous. if a c is present as well as c, they are heterozygous. if homozygous, then put c on each chromosome. if heterozygous, put c on same chromosome as d, put c on other. - look at e, is it positive or negative? if negative, put e on each chromosome. if positive, look at e result to determine if homozygous or heterozygous. if homozygous, put e on each chromosome. if heterozygous, put e on same chromosome as the d unless the d already has a c, put e on other chromosome. dce is more common than dce and dce is extremely rare. put c and e together on same chromosome only if no other possible combinations. most common genotypes the following genotypes are listed as the most common, with 1 being the most common in whites and 7 the least common. r z and r y are so rare they are not included in the following table. incidence of the most common genotypes antigens present, genotype, incidence (dce weiner haplotypes), whites, blacks 1: d, c, c, e, dcece, r 1 r, 31.1%, 8.8% dcedce, r 1 r o, 3.4%, 1.5% dcece, r o r, 0.2%, 1.8% 2: d, c, e, dcedce, r 1 r 1, 17.6%, 2.9% dcece, r 1 r, 1.7%, 0.7% 3: c, e, cece, rr, 1.5%, 7% 4: dccee, dcedce, r 1 r 2, 11.8%, 3.7% dcece, r 1 r, 0.8%, 0.1% dcece, r 2 r, 0.6%, 0.4% 5: dcee, dcece, r 2 r, 10.4%, 5.7% dcedce, r 2 r o, 1.1%, 9.7% 6: dce, dcece, r o r, 3.0%, 22.9% dcedce, r o r o, 0.2%, 19.4% 7: dce, dcedce, r 2 r 2, 2.0%, 1.3% dcece, r 2 r, 0.3%, 0.1% applications of rh genotyping - paternity testing of the blood group antigens is based on a process of exclusion. since the rhd and rhce are closely linked and ce, ce, ce are produced by a single gene, there are limited combinations that the father can provide. - hdn predictability by testing the father's rh genotype. this helps predict likelihood of hdn due to d when mom has anti - d. the most common rh genotype of the father will indicate whether the baby has 0, 50 or 100 probability of being d positive. if the father is also d negative (cece), the baby will be d negative as well and there is a 0 probability of the baby suffering from rh o hdn. if the father's rh genotype appears to be either r 1 r, r 2 r or r o r, the baby has a 50 probability of being d positive and suffering from rh o hdn. on the other hand, if a father's rh genotype appears to be any of the following: r 1 r 1, r 2 r 2, r 1 r 2, r o r o, r 1 r o or r 2 r o, the baby has a 100 probably of getting a d gene from his father and therefore being d positive and suffering from rh o hdn. variants weak d (d u) weak d is a weakly expressed d antigen that will only be demonstrated after incubation at 35 - 37 o c followed with antiglobulin testing (ie being demonstrated only by coombs technique). an rh control must always be run along with the weak d test. always consult the product insert to determine if rh control needs to be run when performing the immediate spin d testing. the following results could be obtained when performing the d testing: immediate spin, 37 o",

woolum, and wilfred bergman. the company worked in defense solutions and research for the military. jon elwood became the director of the facility and was married to ericka woolum. the company had been working on a new piece of power armor before the bombs fell. they were on a military contract to produce this power armor for soldiers fighting in the war. when the bombs were dropped, jon elwood was told by the military that only essential personnel would be given a military escort to safety. because of this, he locked the scientists, including his wife, into their labs until the project was completed. if the team was able to complete the project, elwood would have reached out to his contact in the military and received a safe escape. unfortunately, he kept every scientist besides his wife out of the loop with what had truly transpired above them, fearing that it would send them into a panic and they would be unable. this act of deception widened conflicts between the scientists and ultimately led to the deaths of a portion of the research team and the ghoulification of the remainder. - layout - main lobby when first entering the polymer labs, directly to the left is the orientation room, where molly briefs the sole survivor on a job acquired in the quest cambridge polymer labs. before entering the orientation room, the male and female restrooms are located to the right. to the right lies a passage that brings the player character to the clean room and allows access to the rest of the facility. behind the service desk is a storage area and a door to the right of the player character. this door brings the player character upstairs to more storage areas to the immediate right of the top of the staircase as well as an office location to the far left of the second floor. in the center of the 2nd floor is research area. the research area has a layout like a vault. on the first floor as well as the second floor, the sole survivor will find several numbered samples containers for the cambridge polymer labs quest. a glowing one can be found in a highly irradiated area near the northernmost section of the first floor. this is also the location of the u238, also needed for the quest cambridge polymer labs. there is a polymer coating applicator machine that can combine polymers and isotopes on the first floor after radioactive decontamination. isotopes and polymers can be found throughout the area. from room c1, a passageway has been made along ventilation pipes to the other side of the labs in order to gain access to the locked room c3 holding the radioactive containment password. at the end of the pipe system, ericka elwood -

notes depending on one's answer to molly's interview, they may receive different items according to their job title. the janitor will receive a jumpsuit and a mop, sales will receive dirty tan suit and a pen, research personnel will receive a lab coat and battered clipboard, and security personnel will receive dirty army fatigues, patrolman sunglasses and a baton. if the speech check is failed, you are assigned as a lab assistant and you receive a lab coat and a battered clipboard. one will not be able to drop the samples after the quest cambridge polymer labs ends. the solution is to ask a companion to inspect the reagent in the tube, then \"inspect chemical reagent\" will appear. you can then place another reagent in the tube while the first reagent is still in the tube. keep asking your companion to inspect the tube, then place another reagent in the tube until all reagent quest items are removed from your inventory. a player character can use the computer to identify each sample by placing each sample in the tube, but despite one sample being called gold it can not be used in crafting. there is only one correct combination placed into the polymer coating applicator that produces any result: lithium hydride, gold and u238. any other combination will cause an error message on the terminal and will produce nothing. cambridge polymer labs is a good source of crystal which can be found in microscopes. an eyebot can be met in the wasteland playing recordings of recruitment ads for the labs. if one fast travels to cambridge polymer labs and runs along the road on the left until reaching a lawn mower and returns back, a random encounter will appear every time. eventually random encounters will stop spawning here as there are only a limited amount that will spawn before stopping like at every random encounter location. during the orientation, molly will state that the lab assisted in creating liberty prime which was vital in the defense of anchorage. however, in fallout 3 terminal entries state that liberty prime wasn't even ready when they were taking back anchorage meaning that liberty prime was never in anchorage. - appearances cambridge polymer labs appears only in fallout 4. - behind the scenes cambridge polymer labs does advanced research for the united states military. in real life this work would be for the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa). however, in fallout it is called the defense experimental research projects initiative or derpi. -

        "text": "tech privacy: google is now under investigation after oracle accused it of secretly tracking android users. by david meyer, may 15, 2018. the long - running feud between google and oracle has officially spilled over into the tech - privacy debate, with oracle prompting an australian investigation into google's alleged tracking of android phone users. the australian competition and privacy regulators are jointly looking into oracle's allegations that android phones quietly tell google where users are located, even if they have location services turned off, and even if there is no sim card in the device. these allegations first surfaced in november media reports. while the source of the information was not disclosed at the time, security expert ashkan soltani - formerly the federal trade commission's chief technologist - claimed oracle had disseminated the story and had been trying to do so for months. oracle has now openly repeated the allegations in a presentation to the australian competition and consumer commission (accc), which is probing google and facebook's impact on the advertising market - spoiler: they own it. oracle also said android devices sent google detailed information on people's searches and surfing. crucially, oracle claimed all of these surreptitious data transfers add up to about a gigabyte per month, for which the user has to pay. \"we are exploring how much consumers know about the use of location data and are working closely with the privacy commissioner,\" the accc said in a statement. the office of the australian information commissioner said it was making inquiries with google. google, which has been fighting oracle in court for years over the code used in android, hit back at its nemesis by pointing out that oracle is a major player in the behind - the - scenes trafficking in people's data. \"google is completely focused on protecting our users' data while making the products they love work better for them. users can see what data is collected and how it's used in one easy place - my account - and control it all from there,\" google said. \"like many of oracle's corporate tactics, this presentation is sleight of hand, not facts, and given that oracle markets itself as the world's biggest data broker, they know it. any location data that is sent back to google location servers is anonymized and is not tied or traceable to a specific user,\" the company added. oracle declined to respond to google's parry. sponsored financial content. you may like. read more.",

        "text": "frogman's guide to silver in world of tanks - popular. first, if the moderators feel this should be located in another forum location, please feel free to move it. over the past few months, i have seen many, many, many people post both here as well as on my clan forums with comments about having a lack of silver. many people seem to have troubles with silver management. i would like to share my own personal thoughts and strategies on the subject in hopes that my personal strategies will benefit someone. in this thread, i will be discussing both the incredibly obvious and well as some of the not so obvious ways in which people, previously myself included, burn through silver without noticing and then wonder why they are always broke. i am not an english major, so there may be some spelling errors or perhaps a few long - winded sentences as well as a liberal injection of my own personal brand of witticisms and humor. i realize some of my humor may not be appreciated by some, but i ask that you stick with me and try to pick up nuggets of wisdom attempting to be imparted. if there are those who wish to comment or provide some helpful criticism that would assist in readability, please feel free to comment and your thoughts will be considered. and with that, i - silver production - the mechanics. joining a battle. yes, you get a small amount of silver just by the act of entering a battle. this is a small flat bonus which scales by tank tier and should really be seen as icing on the cake, i.e., if this is your only action, you will be very broke for a long time. spotting a tank for the first time. yep, you get a bit of silver just for being the first to see an enemy tank. double the amount if it's an artillery piece. however, this amount is very small, so again it can not be counted on as your primary income source. base capture. this method of earning silver provides a very small flat bonus to each person within the base when it is captured. damaging the enemy. this is your number 1 means of earning silver and should be one of your primary goals in the game. victory. the joining a battle bonus is multiplied by 1.85. this is quite a small bonus, so really is nothing that will drastically increase your silver production. again, it's just icing on the cake. tank coefficient. each tank in the game has a hidden number which affects its silver production income, i.e., the tank you are playing. so two different tier v tanks that both did 100 damage to the exact same enemy tank and no other actions have the potential to earn different silver payments. premium tanks almost always have a vastly higher coefficient compared to normal tanks. earning silver - the details. do damage as much as you can. if you want silver, you should continue to seek out enemy tanks you can shoot as long as you remain alive, with the exception of the goal of capping to win when you feel you must to secure a victory. sitting in a corner somewhere will not earn you extra silver, i promise. doing damage is the single thing that you can do within the game that will drastically increase your silver earnings. the fact is that the more damage you do, the more silver you will earn; however, as we will discuss later, there is overhead that will reduce your net. with that said, here is where it gets a bit complicated because not all damage is the equal. the current game mechanics provide different silver (and xp for that matter) amounts depending upon what you damage. so for example, if you are in a tier v tank and you do 100 damage to a tier iii tank, you will earn less silver than if you had done the exact same 100 damage to a tier vii tank. there are those who prefer capturing the enemy base as a means of winning the game; however, due to both the silver and xp potential, i will rarely capture an enemy base unless that is the only means of victory within the battle. in cases where i finish an engagement, i use the back button and plot the shortest route to the next engagement in an attempt to deal more damage and thus get more silver (and xp), even if it appears at first glance that i would not make it before the enemy is destroyed or someone might be capturing. likewise, in the case of hopeless situations, such as your team was slaughtered on the other side of the map and it's not a 7 on 1 against you, i will not suicide my tank and will continue looking for something to shoot and to which i can attempt to deal damage. it really does not matter what tank or what tier it is; the fight is not over until the enemy kills me themselves. on a side note, not giving up can be rewarded with a bit of luck and skill with a nice shiny koblanov's medal. i - purchase a premium tank. remember above when i talked about the tank coefficient? coefficient is a fancy word for multiplier; you can think of it like that, it's can be a bit more complicated in the actual formula, but this is the easiest word for most people to understand to get the general concept. and the fact is that premium tanks have a larger multiplier, though they are not all the same multiplier. premium tanks can earn you a great deal of silver income in a short amount of time. as an example, i have an is - 6 which is a tier viii premium russian tank. i typically get an average of games where i earn 75k silver per match. i have had matches where i net as much as 175k with premium time, which we will talk about in a bit. though it is possible, i rarely lose money in my is - 6, yep, i have crap games sometimes and occasionally i even get a streak of them. you have to try really, really hard to lose money in an is - 6 when played even close to correctly. with that said, the is - 6 is not a money press; it is still contingent upon you actually going out and doing damage. out of my almost 400 games in the is - 6 (392 games and 0.78 of all games played), i have been in the red approximately 10 times with premium and approximately 20 times without premium. i won't discuss which specific premium to buy as i really don't know. i will caution you, though, to not purchase a high - tier premium tank when your skills don't support play in its tier. not only are you not realizing the full benefit of the tank, but you are also being an active drain upon your fellow teammates. i realize that there are people who can't or won't spend real - world money on a free game, though, so please read on as there are plenty of other strategies that will help both you and well as those who do financially support wga. i - purchase premium time. this really depends greatly upon the amount of time spent playing wot. if you play quite infrequently, then purchasing premium time is likely not worth it for you. however, i would hazard a guess that most people who read the forums have at least some dedication to the game and play as much as they are able. one word of note here: premium time is a subscription service; you pay for a block of real - world time and it will never be paid for by time used. be warned. this is critical for someone who buys one day and then. for example, consider a tank special where you get a premium tank and 3 days of premium time. it would be exceptionally silly to purchase the tank 30 minutes before you are to leave for a week - long vacation as the premium time will run out and be used. your best value in this situation would be where you will have a substantial amount of time available to play the game and put the purchased premium time to its best possible use. note that premium time purchases are similar to many other economies of scale in today's world. the larger the block of time you purchase at a single time, the less you pay per time unit. if you have the means to purchase the largest possible unit (right around 1 year), it will provide you with the cheapest per - hour charge, so to speak. again, as mentioned above, there are plenty of people who can't or won't spend money, so please continue to read on. i provide the paid options near the top because quite frankly, they are the best possible methods. take advantage of special events. wga frequently have special events that can increase silver production. these typically take the form of something like 50% silver earned increase on german and russian tank tier i - iv, 30% silver earned increase on german and russian tank tier v - vii, 25% silver earned for upon earning the following medals xxx. check each day the news to see if there is a special event which can earn you extra silver. for example, if there is an event that increases silver gain for all tier v vehicles on a weekend, forgo playing your tier viii and play more of your tier v during the event time period. this can really help you generate more silver. likewise, many times events had discounts on certain tier tanks. if you were going to purchase a specific tank anyway, take advantage of that special. however, please make sure to carefully read below. remember, just because something is on sale that does not mean you need to buy it. on the flip side, it's very important that you do not sell any tanks that are part of the special events. when a tank is offered for purchase for a discounted price, then the sell price is reduced by the exact same amount. add to that fact that all tanks only net you 50% of the original purchase price and selling a particular tank that is discounted during the event is a want to lose massive amounts of silver, especially at the higher tier. if you are following my guide principles, you can wait a few additional days as you already have enough to purchase the new tank you just unlocked and still hold onto the old tank for a few additional days until it's not longer on sell and maximize your silver losses. spending silver - buying tanks/upgrading packages. this is why most people play the game. some want to get to specific tanks and work toward that goal. others want to have all tanks unlocked at some point, that's me. regardless, most people will at some point buy some different tanks from the one they start with. i will detail what i see as both positive and negative approaches. many people i have encountered who have issues with silver have lots of tanks in their garage and they are actively playing every single one. in my humble opinion, this is a mistaken approach if you are already having issues with silver reserves. this is made even worse by those who have purchased additional garage slots either individually or via a parking pass block. personally, i recommend having 2 - 3 tanks on which you can grind hard. i also suggest staggering these tanks by at least one tier and perhaps 2 for a less adept player. the issue is that upgrading. another thing i see people do is purchase a child tank as soon as they have completed the research on it and it's been made available. again, this is a poor strategy for someone who is already running on low silver reserves. my personal approach is to complete research on a tank and then continue to play the tank for multiple days or in a few cases weeks. i tend to play a tank for approximately 3 - 50 games more than required to get the tank to elite. there are a...",

look at what the bear guides carry and you'll find the vast majority carry rifles, generally starting at 338 win mag and going up. they are the ones that have actually had to fire close - range killing shots on bears under less than ideal situations. they have seen what works and what doesn't. about the only thing those guides seem to do over the years is move to more. something to consider. <phone> 17 fishingis4play new member join date: apr 2006 location: wasilla, alaska posts: 199 slugs. 12 ga 3 - inch brenneke black magic 600 - grain slug at 4 feet, as you can see, they work just fine. buck shot is for birds, and if you think a blind bear is better, they can still smell you. kill them fast and break them down, my theory, and it has worked so far. attached images dsc00450jpg 1303 kb 169 views <phone> 18 yukon254 member join date: aug 2007 location: yukon, canada posts: 1396 3030 told ya lots on here would tell you that 00 buck was no good. no question the big bores are better if you can shoot them, most can't. more bears, grizzly and blacks, have been killed in self - defense with the grand old 3030 and 303 than all the new wiz bangers combined. a lot of african phs carry 00 buck for leopard, guess.",

jimss, member join date: apr 2006 posts: 283 glacier water drinkable here goes another ak greenie question. i am curious if silty water coming directly out of a glacier is drinkable wout treatment. are there bugs that live in glacier ice that can screw up your digestive tract? if so, do most of you use filters to get rid of all the silt or will the silt quickly plug filters? how about using pills? 07/12/2009 2 - oakman, member join date: apr 2007 location: eagle river, alaska, united states posts: 1247 i filter just about everything that i drink. dealing with glacial silt can be done by collecting some water and allowing it to settle before filtering, or by using some sort of pre - filter. coffee filters seem to work pretty well to get the bulk of the silt out. you could also just use your filter. i'm not sure how many liters you can get out of a filter when it is getting loaded with silt. another option would be to find another source of water that is from runoff. 07/13/2009 3 - jim strutz, member join date: aug 2006 location: anchorage posts: 1449 theoretically, giardia cysts or other pests could get into water 10 from the glacier face, but chances are it's pretty safe. there are ice worms in some glaciers, but i believe they are safe to ingest. of course, the farther you get from the source, the more likely something could get into the water. so if you're 10 - 20 miles from the glacier, it's probably not that safe even though it's still cold, silty. the reality is most fresh alaska water will not make you sick, 9 times out of 10 you'll be fine. but that's not much better odds than playing russian roulette, so i don't do it. the silt won't hurt you though. you can strain it through your teeth if you want. leaves a funny grit in your mouth, but i've drunk plenty of it years ago. silty water is a pain to filter. even after sitting overnight, there is enough fine silt to clog your filter pretty quick. prefiltering helps but doesn't cure the problem, and your pre - filter clogs up quick. you could use chemical treatments, but some cysts are notorious for suviving chlorine and/or iodine. uv lights are great on the cysts but don't penetrate well enough in the silt to be effective. the only other solution is boiling. well, that and taking the bet that this is one of those 9 out of 10 safe places. i look for clean - looking sources for filtering. 07/18/2009 4 - broncoformudv, member join date: apr 2006 location: anchorage, alaska posts: 4670 there are enough clear streams in alaska that i have never contemplated dealing with glacier water. never liked having sand in my mouth and don't plan on drinking sandy water if i can help it. you can filter it out, but it will clog up your filter in no time and will even make it past a pre - filter and/or clog the pre - filter in no time. 07/18/2009 5 - brettaksci, member join date: mar 2009 location: anchorage posts: 1694 use a coffee filter over a nalgene bottle to collect the water. then use a stiry pen pump or chemicals to treat it. it would suck being out in the middle of no where with stomach issues. brett 07/19/2009 6 -

trapperbob, member join date: apr 2006 location: anchorage posts: 451 drink the water. if you are high in a valley and taking water out of a fast - moving glacial stream, just drink the water. i have for over 40 yrs, and when i was young we drank from the lakes, although i wouldn't suggest that now knowing a little more about the bugs in some water. i think high in a sheep drainage is a whole lot safer than 9 out of 10. unless it's really turbulent water, the silt is probably not even noticable. 07/21/2009 10 - alaskatrueadventure, member join date: apr 2006 location: paradise, alaska posts: 1543 clear h2o, jimss there is clear water at the airstrip/base camp location where you will be at. i forget if the canyon right behind your camp has a trickle of water of not. but most of the canyon/valleys in that country have some water somewhere some of the time. the main river will be very thickly silted with glacial silt of flour. but there are some places just 100 yards from your base camp where clear water simply oozes up out of the ground in several small but usable seeps. up high where the sheep are at, you can almost always find a clear water seep. you might have to fill your water bottle lid - full by lid - full. i seldom pass up a good water source when sheep hunting. sometimes water is everywhere. other times not. i have drank a bunch of glacial water over the years. don't look at it. it is easier to drink if you do not look at it. but i have never suffered any strange effects or is it affects? i personally drink alot of water unfiltered. i will until i get sick someday. i do have one friend who has had beaver fever three times. i strongly dislike chlorine. i do not dislike iodine tablets. i do filter all water on the guided hunts i conduct. drinkable water will not be an issue where you are going. if you have to hike out, water is a possible problem the last 8 miles after you hike up out of the valley bottom. dennis, alaska 07/27/2009 11 - northway, member join date: apr 2006 posts: 2761 i've never filtered water on a sheep hunt. have never been sick. i guess until i get sick, i will continue drinking it right from the tap. 07/30/2009 12 - erik in ak, member join date: jul 2006 location: anchorage posts: 2019 glacial silt will jam up a filter in a hurry. if you dig a hole a few feet back from the river in a spot where the bank is low so you don't have to dig too far down, the water will trickle in clear, filling the void. if you're going to be in one spot for a few days, it's worth the effort. quick navigation: alaska outdoor gear top bookmarks: digg, delicious, stumbleupon, google posting permissions: you may not post new threads. you may not post replies. you may not post attachments. you may not edit your posts. bb code is on. smilies are on. img code is on. video code is on. html code is off. forum rules contact us alaska outdoors forums archive top",

triangle, dramatic toein, slight toein. tnt95 jun 25, 2013. 1. ponkine, forum resident, location: vina del mar, chile i think i've my speakers about 30 towards the centre of the room. ponkine jun 25, 2013. 2. larry i, forum resident, location: washington dc toe in is something one has to experiment to determine what is best. toe in puts the listener more directly on axis to the drivers, which will change the tonal balance the listener hears (usually brighter sounding when toed in). toe in will also decrease the amount of signal that will bounce off the nearby side wall, and this too affects tonal balance and imaging. generally speaking, with more toe - in, the center image becomes more solid and focused, but stage width will narrow. this usually means a trade - off between the two, and one has to determine whether more width or... if one needs a very wide listening area, some chairs much nearer to one speaker than the other, sometimes extreme toe - in (the axis of the drivers crossing well in front of the center chair) will help with imaging. this is the case because the outside chair that is much closer to one speaker will also be much further off axis from that speaker, and the far speaker will be more on axis, so that closer proximity of one is somewhat compensated for by more direct and therefore louder sound by the other. larry i jun 25, 2013. 3. mike mcmann, gary and jupiterboy like this. sneaky pete, forum resident, location: nyc, usa i am constantly fiddling incrementally with toe in to strike that perfect balance. sneaky pete jun 25, 2013. 4. rickchick likes this. ashulman, forum resident, location: utica, ny sneaky pete said, \"i am constantly fiddling incrementally with toe in to strike that perfect balance.\" me too. this week i've gone with about a foot outside the ears. this has helped with a problem of too much perceived warmth. my spread is pretty wide now, so soundstage width is not really an issue. i think i'm sticking with this for a while. ashulman jun 25, 2013. 5. socalwjs, forum resident, location: near the coast in southern slo county also depends on your particular speaker and its dispersion pattern. some benefit from toe - in more than others. experiment until you are happy. socalwjs jun 25, 2013. 6. apesfan, forum resident, location: holtsville, long island, ny, usa now that my room is of a good size (15x22), i have no toe - in. i love the effects of the room like a small music hall. plus, the speakers i listen to mostly are bi - polar. john m. apesfan jun 25, 2013. 7. raferx, forum resident, location: vancouver, canada maybe two degrees of toe - in, almost not noticeable looking at speakers which are about 12 feet apart. raferx jun 25, 2013. 8. _rod_serling_, well - known member, location: florida i have dali zensor 7s and the manual recommends no toe - in due to the wide dispersion tweeters. with my older amp, i found i still needed to toe it in somewhat to make the soundstage feel cohesive. now that i have upgraded to my cronus magnum, i found that my soundstage was a bit hotter and vinyl noise was more noticeable. so this weekend i was able to rearrange and increase the space between my speakers and listening position and left them with no toe in, and it sounds much wider and the vinyl noise is now moved back. _rod_serling_ jun 25, 2013. 9. action pact, forum resident, location: lexington, massachusetts slight toe - in on my rega r1 bookshelfs, optimized for the best compromise between dynamics and imaging. action pact jun 25, 2013. 10. brewdrinkrepeat, forum resident, location: merchantville, nj pretty significant toe - in with my paradigm studio 80s. i aim them for the center of the wall behind me, but the room isn't that large, so that results in what i'm guessing is a 15 - 20 degree angle. brewdrinkrepeat jun 25, 2013. 11. ben_wood, rollin with the tide, location: in and around the lake socalwjs said, \"also depends on your particular speaker and its dispersion pattern. some benefit from toe -

in (the speakers are angled slighty mor than directly at the listening position, say about 2 feet in front of it). the toe - in is also to make the back angle sound more toward the corners instead of at the big picture window on the wall behind them. elizabethh jun 25, 2013. 13. wasatch, music lover, location: grand junction, colorado socalwjs said, \"also depends on your particular speaker and its dispersion pattern. some benefit from toe - in more than others. experiment until you are happy.\" exactly. i prefer the imaging to be dead center and deep, making the speakers disappear. wasatch jun 25, 2013. 14. hifi guy 008, forum resident, location: connecticut slight to moderate toe - in, not matter what speaker. i have a fairly large, difficult room with a sloping ceiling that goes from 8 to 18 abruptly, then slopes down to 8 ft. it's about 20 x 18 feet with a ceiling fan and wooden beams. speakers aren't near any walls, but are in front of a bookshelf which helps improve the lower freqs. was going to splurge on newer, more expensive full rangers, considered some huge duntechs (now called dunlavy) (<url> - corona - del - principe - duntech - crown - prince), but i realized i may never get the bass oomph in this room without a sub or two additional speakers in back. hifi guy 008 jun 25, 2013. 15. purplerocks, forum resident, location: in brewdrinkrepeat said, \"pretty significant toe - in with my paradigm studio 80s. i aim them for the center of the wall behind me, but the room isn't that large, so that results in what i'm guessing is a 15 - 20 degree angle.\" pretty similar for my studio 60s, aimed to hit the wall behind me, makes the soundstage decently wide with very solid center image. purplerocks jun 25, 2013. 16. bob_in_okc, forum resident, location: dallas, texas slight toe - in, just to reduce side wall interaction a bit. soundstage is still wide. bob_in_okc jun 25, 2013. 17. doctorcilantro likes this. rickchick, forum resident, location: pa sneaky pete said, \"i am constantly fiddling incrementally with toe in to strike that perfect balance.\" me too, and i got these speakers four years ago. it's ocd on my part, and happily is the only thing i am ocd about. four years and i still don't know which set up is best. my music room is rather small, and there is a lot of clutter with my software and guitars. rickchick jun 25, 2013. 18. mr class quality, 100 proof, location: dunedin, south island, new zealand mine face straight down the room (well, actually across the room as i'm set up on the long wall). no choice in the matter. i find the sound is better balanced without toe - in and too confronting with toe - in. mr class quality jun 25, 2013. 19. rickchick, forum resident, location: pa i have the studio 100s and just moved them a foot or more closer to each other and back a little closer to the back wall. listening to vans \"too late to stop now\" and it sounds great. hey, maybe i can keep this placement. rickchick jun 25, 2013. 20. bluemooze, forum resident, location: frenchtown, nj, usa toein is essential, but you can only get the best results by experimenting. if we put my speakers in your listening room, the toe - in amount that i use isn't necessarily what will work in your room. also, something else that i've found is just as essential is speaker height. makes almost as big a difference as toe - in. obviously, floor standers are extremely limited in this respect, but some of them can be slightly adjusted if they have screwin spikes. if you don't have floor standers, then use a bunch of books to find out what the best speaker height is for you. do this after you've adjusted toe - in. once you've got the correct height dialed in for your listening position, then you can purchase speaker stands that match the correct height. i think speaker height adjustment is more important based on how far away from the speakers you are. if you're listening near - field, then it makes a huge difference. bluemooze jun 26, 2013. 21. ellsworth likes this. mwheelerk, \"if you fly a flag of hate you aint no kin to me\", location: my country tis of thee i don't think there is a hard and fast rule with the variance in rooms, speakers and positioning, but more times than not, i have the speaker toe - in. i use the center line of the tweeter, and i think some use the inside edge of the cabinet, crossing just behind my head. i use a laser level to make the adjustment. mwheelerk jun 26, 2013. 22. chazz, music addict, location: southeastern us the amount of toe - in is effected by room treatment as well. if you have your side walls treated at the first reflection point, then toe - in should be less than untreated walls. before i had treated my side walls, i had my speakers toed in to cross about a foot behind my head. once i treated the first reflection points on both side walls, i set my speakers up straight ahead and only had to adjust them a couple inches to snap in the soundstage to my liking. chazz jun 26, 2013. 23. milmascaras, musicologist, location: los angeles, ca equilateral triangle x golden ratio x listening sweet spot fine tune adjustments. milmascaras jun 26, 2013. 24. tmsorosk, more music please, location: sprucegrove, canada the cardas web site has a great speaker set up video, great place to start, then fine tune from there. i prefer the sound from the 80 triangle method to the equilateral triangle. tmsorosk jun 26, 2013. 25. you must log in or sign up to reply here. 1. 2. thread status: not open for further replies. share this page. forums -

        "text": "insider trading: examining tipper and tippee liability by greg kramer, gc, new york, may 9, 2013 as discussed in a feb. 14, 2013 article by this author, \"insider trading: examining primary theories of liability,\" insider trading has been a top enforcement priority for the securities and exchange commission and will most likely continue to be a top priority for the foreseeable future. in fact, the sec recently released a statistic that it has instituted more insider trading actions in the last three years than during any three - year period in the agency's history. among the recent sec enforcement actions, cases involving tippers and tippees have featured prominently. this article will focus on the standards of liability for tippers and tippees. insider trading generally in brief, illegal insider trading is trading while in possession of material non - public information in breach of a duty arising out of a fiduciary relationship or other relationship of trust and confidence. there are two primary theories of insider trading liability: the classical theory and misappropriation theory. the classical theory, which applies to insiders of a corporation, provides that an insider breaches his or her duty of trust and confidence to the corporation and its shareholders when the insider trades on material non - public information learned by reason of his or her position with the corporation. the misappropriation theory is a complement to the classical theory that applies to market participants other than corporate insiders. under the misappropriation theory, a person engages in illegal insider trading when he or she trades while in possession of material non - public information in breach of a duty owed to the source of information. for purposes of the misappropriation theory, such a duty may arise as a result of a fiduciary relationship, such as an attorney - client relationship, or a result of an agreement. one who has a fiduciary duty of trust and confidence to a corporation and its shareholders (classical theory) or to a source of confidential information (misappropriation theory) and is in receipt of material non - public information has a duty to abstain from trading in the absence of public disclosure of such information. standards of liability under both the classical and misappropriation theories of insider trading, tippers and tippees of material non - public information may face liability for insider trading. the standards for liability under both theories generally overlap. tipper liability requires that: 1. the tipper had a duty to keep the material non - public information confidential, and the tipper knew that the information was non - public and material, or the tipper acted with reckless disregard of the nature of the information; 2. the tipper breached that duty by intentionally or recklessly relaying the information to a tippee who could use the information in connection with securities trading; and 3. the tipper received a personal benefit with respect to the tipping. tippee liability requires that: 1. the tipper breached a duty by tipping confidential information; 2. the tippee knew or had reason to know that the tippee improperly obtained the information (i.e., that the information was obtained through the tipper's breach); and 3. the tippee, while in possession of the material non - public information, used the information by trading or by tipping for a personal benefit. the existence of the personal benefit mentioned above is a fact - specific inquiry, but it is broadly construed and is not limited to pecuniary benefit. improvement of one's reputation with the tippee, the positive emotions that result from helping out a friend or relative, and the expectation of a continued business relationship have all been found to satisfy the personal benefit requirement. also, a tippee need not know definitively that the tipper disclosed the material non - public information in breach of a duty. insider trading liability will attach if the tippee should have known of the tipper's breach. whether a tippee should have known of the tipper's breach is a fact - specific inquiry, and an important factor may be the sophistication of the tippee. financial professionals may be viewed as being particularly sophisticated. tipping chains the analysis of tipper - tippee liability in tipping chains follows the same basic outline set forth above. in a tipping chain, the first tippee communicates the material non - public information to a second tippee - the so - called remote tippee - and so on. a tipper will be liable if he tips material non - public information in breach of a fiduciary duty to someone he knows will likely: 1. trade on the information; or 2. disseminate the information further for the first tippee's own benefit. the first tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained and transmitted through a breach of a fiduciary duty and intentionally or recklessly tip the information further for his or her own benefit. the final tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained through a breach of a fiduciary duty and trade while in possession of the information. in theory, a tippee removed from the primary tipper by several links in the tipping chain could face insider trading liability. tender offers the sec's rule 14e - 3 governs insider trading in the context of tender offers. rule 14e - 3(a) provides that if a bidder has taken a substantial step to commence a tender offer, no other person who possesses material non - public information relating to the tender offer that was acquired directly or indirectly from the bidder, the target company, or any insider or other person acting on behalf of the bidder or the target company can buy or sell the target company's securities unless the material non - public information is publicly disclosed. note that there is no requirement under rule 14e - 3 that the trader be. rule 14e - 3(d) also prohibits tipping of material non - public information regarding a tender offer to third parties. the bidder, the target company, and insiders and other persons acting on behalf of the bidder or the target company are prohibited from communicating material non - public information relating to a tender offer to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such communication is likely to result in a violation of rule 14e - 3(a). in addition, any person in possession of material information relating to a tender offer that is non - public and that he or she knows or has reason to know has been acquired directly or indirectly from any of the foregoing persons is also prohibited from tipping such information. said slightly differently, a tippee who further tips violates rule 14e - 3(d). situations the need to address insider trading issues may come up in a number of different circumstances during the course of an investor's due diligence of an investment. as part of information gathering, an investor may inadvertently receive material non - public information that could expose the investor to insider trading liability as a tippee. the following are some examples of situations in which an investor may unintentionally acquire material non - public information: gathering information from company representatives directors, officers, and employees of a public company are frequently in possession of material non - public information regarding their own company and their customers, suppliers, and competitors. directors, officers, and employees of a company, as well as temporary insiders such as lawyers, accountants, and financial advisors, almost always have a duty of trust and confidence to the company. company representatives may be in breach of such duty when they share confidential information with outsiders. talking to investment bankers and sell - side firms such as brokers investment bankers and brokers are often in possession of material non - public information and other confidential information regarding their clients and may have duties of trust and confidence to their clients and the financial services firms that employ the investment bankers and brokers. talking to other market participants and representatives of buy - side investors such as analysts and portfolio managers at hedge funds information about a buy - side investor's plans to purchase or sell securities or other plans with respect to a security may constitute material non - public information. for example, information about a buy - side investor's plans to liquidate a large position. representatives of buy - side investors are usually subject to duties of trust and confidence to the firms that employ them and may not be authorized to discuss confidential information with outsiders. use of expert networks expert networks are firms that connect buy - side investors with industry experts. the industry experts may be current or former senior employees of, or consultants to, public companies or current or former government officials. these industry experts may be in possession of material non - public information and subject to duties of trust and confidence. investors should not assume that the industry experts are properly trained with respect to insider trading compliance or know that they should not share material non - public information. in general, investors should make clear to the expert that they are not seeking a tip. since the expert will be compensated, an investor should disclaim that he or she is seeking information the disclosure of which would cause the expert to violate a duty to a third party. conclusions certain recent sec enforcement actions demonstrate that even casual disclosures of material non - public information between friends risk drawing regulatory scrutiny if the recipient of the information trades or further disseminates the information to someone who does trade. individuals who are entrusted with material non - public information, such as employees and other representatives of public companies, investment bankers and brokers, as well as investors who engage in information gathering, must take care to avoid becoming inadvertent tippers and tippees. investors, financial firms, and public companies need to be aware of insider trading laws, properly train and educate employees concerning insider trading compliance. greg kramer is a partner in the corporate and securities practice areas of kleinberg kaplan wolff cohen.",

        "text": "red lionfish, june 23, 2014. alcom. more lionfish off florida and louisiana than off alabama, but there are plenty here. alex fogg was interviewed by ben raines regarding lionfish in the northern gulf. photo credit: primofish.com. scientific name: pterois volitans. common names: red lionfish, common lionfish, butterfly cod, turkey fish, fire fish. order: scorpaeniformes. family: scorpaenidae. conservation status: not evaluated by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources (iucn). considered an undesirable invasive species in the us, bahamas, and the caribbean. note: pterois volitans and pterois miles, a closely related sister species, were once thought to be a single species. it is difficult to distinguish between the two without dna analysis. pterois volitans is the more common in atlantic and caribbean waters, accounting for approximately 93% of the invasive lionfish population. description: red lionfish (photo credit: brian gratwicke). the red lionfish is a scorpionfish in the family scorpaenidae. they are conspicuous for their elongated feathery fins, bold patterning, and behavior. adults reach a length of about 18.5 inches (47 cm) and a weight of 2.6 lbs (1.2 kg). like other scorpionfish, the red lionfish has large feathery fins that protrude from the body, suggesting the mane of a male lion. spiny projections on the head and venomous spines in the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins make the fish less desirable to potential predators. numerous fleshy tabs on the head may mimic algal growth to camouflage the fish. while coloration varies, red lionfish are characterized by bold, narrow vertical bands of red, maroon or red - brown, alternating with broader white or yellowish bands. the fins are spotted. male and female red lionfish are similar in appearance and show distinct traits only during courtship and breeding. red lionfish are slow - moving and behave as if they are extremely confident or indifferent to threats. they rely on their coloration, camouflage, and poisonous spines to deter predators. adults are solitary and tend to remain in one location for long periods. they will fiercely defend their home range against other lionfish and other species. they congregate in small groups only as juveniles and during breeding season. your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. lionfish have not been widely exploited as a commercial species but are very popular as aquarium fish. releases of aquarium fish who have grown too large may account for the introduction of lionfish into new areas. in popular culture, fictional red lionfish have appeared in the aquarium of captain jean - luc picard's ready room in star trek: the next generation and in the aquarium of the villain who challenges james bond in the spy who loved me. occurrence: red lionfish (photo credit: us geological service). the native range of the red lionfish is the western pacific ocean and eastern indian ocean. the similar pterois miles occurs in area between the red sea and sumatra. typical red lionfish habitat is described as near and offshore coral and rocky reefs to depths of about 165 feet (50 meters). however, in their natural range, they also appear in shallow coastal and estuarine waters, with the highest population densities being in shallower inshore waters. large adults have also been observed at depths of 1,000 - 300 meters in the open ocean. lionfish are said to be primarily nocturnal, preferring to shelter under ledges or crevices during the day. however, daylight activity and feeding are also common. life cycle: reproduction. lionfish have a prodigious reproductive capacity. they reach sexual maturity is less than a year and spawn year - round in warmer waters. females can spawn as often as every three to four days. females produce 15 to 30 thousand eggs per batch, so that a single fish in warm waters can produce as many as two million eggs per year. during breeding, one male may associate with several females. the coloration of the male darkens and its stripes become less distinct, while females become paler. spawning occurs near the surface, with males immediately fertilizing the released eggs. the eggs hatch in about 36 hours and may spend 30 days in a pelagic stage, allowing them to disperse widely on ocean currents. this characteristic has facilitated the rapid expansion of their range in the altantic and caribbean. larval fish are good swimmers and begin feeding on small ciliate protozoa just four days after conception. juvenile fish grow rapidly as much as. the typical red lionfish is thought to live for around 10 years, though captive specimens have survived for as long as 35 years. feeding: the red lionfish is one of the apex predators in the coral reef environment and they are described as robust generalists in their feeding. they consume small fish, shrimp, crabs, and other invertebrates, typically smaller than 4 inches (10 cm) in length. lionfish feed in a solitary manner, approaching their prey slowly, finally seizing it in a lightning - quick lunge and snap of the jaws and swallowing it whole. your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. lionfish exhibit two interesting feeding behaviors. they spread their long feathery pectoral fins to form a visual barrier and herd small fish into a confined space so that they are easier to capture. even more unusual is their use of water jets in capturing prey. the lionfish approaches the prey slowly and directs jets of water at the prey. there are two potential explanations for how this might benefit the lionfish. one is that the prey attempts to align itself with the moving water and is thus easier to capture and swallow head first. the other is that the turbulence of the water jet confuses the preys sensory systems. a video of this behavior is available on the interresearch science center website. animated map of red lionfish report from 1985 through 2013. source: usgs, reef, and noaa via gulf and caribbean fisheries institute. animated version from the reef website. the lionfish invasion. dr. mark albins, who conducted a seminar on red lionfish at gcrl on october 10, 2013, described the red lionfish as the \"perfect superinvader.\" red lionfish reproduce rapidly, grow rapidly, disperse readily on ocean currents, tolerate a variety of habitats, and have few natural controls. many species of fish and invertebrates that are preyed upon by invasive lionfish do not recognize the odd - looking newcomers as threats. see the progress of the lionfish invasion from 1985 through 2013 in the animated map on the right. lionfish are thriving in their new range. they grow about one quarter larger than in their native range, and their population densities can be five times greater. it is thought that red lionfish arrived in the us waters either by releases from hobbyist aquariums or in the ballast water of ships. the earliest reported sighting occurred in south florida in 1985. they have spread at an astonishing rate along the us east and gulf coasts and throughout the caribbean. the map of reported red lionfish captures on the right shows the rapid expansion of their invasive range from 1985 through 2013. invasive lionfish populations have grown about 67% per year. field experiments have shown that lionfish can quickly displace 80% of the native fish populations on coral. the red lionfish's sister species, pterois miles, comprises about 7% of the invasive population. to date, pterois miles occurs as an invasive primarily on the eastern seaboard of the us. lionfish populations are established as far north as cape hatteras, and juvenile fish have been found in new york and rhode island. low water temperatures during winter probably prevent the fish from overwintering in northern regions. this lionfish invasion is raising major concerns about the impacts of red lionfish on native hardbottom, mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef communities, and even on estuarine habitats. the concern is not only the direct predation of the lionfish on native fishes and competition with native fish for food sources, but cascading effects throughout the entire ecosystem. for example, what effect might a significant reduction in the number of cleaner fish have on fish populations who depend on them? how will corals fare if lionfish remove a significant portion of the herbivorous fish whose feeding helps keep seaweeds and algas from. predators and natural controls: few natural predators of red lionfish have been documented, even in their natural range. it is not well understood how lionfish populations in their native range are kept in check. they appear to be less affected by external parasites than other fish, both in their native range and their invasive range. within their invasive range, it is likely that sharks and other larger piscivorous fish (eating fish) have not yet recognized lionfish as prey. however, it is encouraging that lionfish have been found in the stomachs of groupers in the bahamas. human control of invasive lionfish is not likely to provide an overall or long - term eradication or control option. however, it may be possible to control the population of lionfish in limited, selected areas by regular removal efforts. defense mechanisms: danger to humans. scorpionfishes, including the red lionfish, earn their common name with their ability to defend themselves with a sting or stab from venom delivered via spines in their fins. lionfish are among the most venomous of all fishes. the red lionfish have venomous spines in their dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. lionfish should be handled carefully; an envenomation is a serious medical issue. in humans, the venom causes intense pain and inflammation. serious systemic symptoms such as respiratory distress, abdominal pain, seizures, and loss of consciousness may also occur. a lionfish sting is rarely fatal, though some people are more susceptible to the venom than others. one source suggests that scorpionfishes as a group rank second only to stingrays in total number of envenomations, with 40,000 - 50,000 instances per year. noaa recommends treating a puncture wound by immersing the wound area in hot water. other sources suggest 113f or 45c for 30 to 90 minutes as first aid, followed by prompt attention from a medical professional. the poison help hotline at 800 - 222 - 1222 may provide further information. details on recognizing, collecting, and handling lionfish are provided in this flyer. resources, references, photos and videos. each item opens in a new window. close the new window to return here.",

        "text": "january 2, 2013. entity framework and setting primary keys on views. when using entity framework, it's important to set primary keys on table and view objects in sql server. if you skip this step, ef will define a composite primary key made of all non - nullable columns belonging to the object. that way, you can end up with some strange results and spend hours finding out what went wrong. trust me, i've been there. so, first of all, set primary keys in the database. ok, with tables, that's just it: set the primary keys and you're good to go. now, what about views? in case of views having primary keys defined in underlying tables, that should also be enough. but what to do if there are simply no columns to use as pk? well, this can be achieved by using row_number function. here is the actual example from one of my projects: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. create dbovw_action as select row_number() over (order by actiondate desc) as rowid, from user1id as userid, null as friendid, object1id, object2id, actiontype, actiondate from vw_actionbase where actiontype = 1 group by user1id, object1id, object2id, actiontype, actiondate union user1id as userid, null as friendid, object1id, object2id, actiontype, actiondate from vw_actionbase where actiontype = 2 group by user1id, object1id, object2id, actiontype, actiondate union user1id as userid, null as friendid, object1id, object2id, actiontype, actiondate from vw_actionbase where actiontype = 3 group by user1id, object1id, object2id, actiontype, object1id, actiondate x. now, here's something that made me confused. i've expected rowid column to be defined as not null. i thought that if there was a row, it should have a number. but i was wrong, as you can see. so, the column i wanted to use as primary key (rowid) was nullable, and the other (actiontype), that shouldn't be primary key, was in fact the only pk candidate for entity framework. as expected, when i performed \"update from database\" option, the result in edmx file was: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. entitytype name = vw_action key propertyref name = actiontype key property name = userid, type = int property name = friendid, type = int property name = object1id, type = int property name = object2id, type = int property name = actiontype, type = int, nullable = false property name = actiondate, type = datetime property name = rowid, type = bigint entitytype. if you get tempted to set keys manually in ef, don't. you will run into errors similar to these: efmodelmodel.msl(266,10) error 3002: problem in mapping fragment starting at line 266. potential runtime violation of table vw_actions keys. vw_actionactiontype columns vw_actionactiontype are mapped to entityset vw_actions properties vw_actionactiontype on the conceptual side, but they do not form the entitysets key properties vw_actionrowid. efmodelmodel.msl(266,10) error 3003: problem in mapping fragment starting at line 266. all the key properties vw_actionrowid of the entityset vw_action must be mapped to all the key properties vw_actionactiontype of table vw_action. also, changes will be lost on next update from database. so, what's the solution? the solution is to explicitly define columns you want for pk in sql server as non - nullable using isnull function. similary, if there is an actual non - nullable column that you want excluded from the pk, use nullif like this: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. create dbovw_action as select userid, friendid, object1id, object2id, nullif(actiontype, 1) as actiontype, actiondate, isnull(row_number() over (order by actiondate desc), 1) as rowid from x. what will be the result of this code? sql server will understand that rowid could never be null; it will be set to 1 in case of null value (although this will never happen in my case anyway). on the other hand, actiontype column that can actually never be null (since it has values 1, 2 and 3) will be interpreted as nullable. here is how it all looks in the end. after updating model from the database, the right column will be set as entity primary key in edmx file. edit: related post: a quick note on coalesce and isnull. written by ana mrvos. posted in how - to, programming. tagged with asp.net, c#, entity framework, sql server 2013, google charts, asp.net, jquery, ajax. quick, easy. tweets by aancheee. tags io15, perfmatters, serbiaflooding, bosniaflooding, croatiaflooding, 1994 - 2015, ajax, april, arabic, asp.net, barbie, bosnia, c, chrome, conference, croatia, crystal reports, day, devtools, entity framework, example, extnet, ext js, fear, filmstrip, flooding, fools, gamification, gmail, godaddy, google, gregorian, happiness, herzegovina, io, infinite, java, javascript, jcrop, jenkins, jquery, life, microsoft, nikola tesla, optimization, performance, persian, philosophy, plugin, problem, scala, scroll, serbia, sexism, sf, shamsi, society, software, sql server, ted, tools, transformation, webpagetest, women, xml, xslt. find me on facebook. archives july 2015, june 2015, may 2015, november 2014, september 2014, august 2014, may 2014, october 2013, july 2013, june 2013, may 2013, april 2013, march 2013, february 2013, january 2013, december 2012, november 2012. categories blogging, general, how - to, humor, programming, rambling, troubleshooting.",

        "text": "home for consumers. education and prevention. mental health publications. risk and protective factors. the approaches considered so far generally take a singular emphasis for intervention. for example, interventions to improve compliance with medication prioritise a medical approach; a cognitive view is adopted in the case of cbt interventions; and social and educational viewpoints are emphasised for self - help programs. it is argued, however, that a single model of intervention is not sufficient and that there are major advantages to more comprehensive and holistic approaches that respond to multiple areas of intervention need (eg kramer et al 2003). a more holistic approach to prevention focuses on identifying the multiple risk and protective factors for mental health. risk factors are those that contribute to a person's vulnerability to relapse, whereas protective factors mitigate against relapse by enhancing wellbeing. risk factors increase the likelihood that a disorder will develop and can exacerbate the burden of existing disorder, while protective factors give people resilience in the face of adversity and moderate the impact of stress and transient symptoms on social and emotional wellbeing, thereby reducing the likelihood of disorders (monograph 2000, p13). evidence related to the risk and protective factors for relapse of mental illness is an area of much - needed research activity. stress is commonly implicated in exacerbating mental illness (eg ventura et al 1989). in particular, longer - term stressors in a person's social and physical environment and lack of opportunities for fresh starts are factors that are likely to increase the likelihood of relapse and impede recovery (brown et al 1988; paykel et al 2001). risk and protective factors occur through income and social status, physical environments, education and educational settings, working conditions, social environments, families, biology and genetics, personal health practices and coping skills, sport and recreation, the availability of opportunities as well as through access to health services (action plan 2000, p9). lists of potential risk and protective factors are provided in monograph 2000 (pp15 - 16), which cautions, however, that it is important to note that while the available evidence shows that these factors are associated with mental health outcomes, the strength of association and level of evidence for causation varies. consequently, no causal relationship can be assumed for these factors. for some individuals, there will be no impact of any particular factor or combination of factors, while for other people a particular factor or combination of factors may have a major impact on their ongoing mental health. importantly, monograph 2000 (p34) points out that it is possible that quite different factors influence the relapse and recurrence of disorder compared with those that influence its onset (zubrick et al 2000a). for example, a determinant of the onset of conduct disorder in children may be poor fetal growth (zubrick et al 2000b; breslau 1995), while determinants of the persistence of this disorder at the time a clinician sees the child may be poor parental monitoring and a deviant peer group (national crime prevention 1999). these latter determinants form part of the prognosis for treatment and need to be considered as targets for relapse prevention, while the former determinant (now no longer amenable to treatment) is an early risk factor and target for indicated prevention. clearly, all the domains of life - environmental, physical, social and emotional - can be a source of both strength and stress. varying levels of evidence suggest that risk and protective factors are likely to be evident in the areas of accommodation, employment, forms of meaningful activity, harmful alcohol and other drug use, physical health, social relationships, violence and factors that shape personal resilience. a word of caution is required regarding the implementation of relapse prevention in terms of applying a risk - based approach. monograph 2000 presents the following potential problems of such an approach. firstly, risk factors have limitations as predictive tools. the extent to which any particular risk factor contributes to an episode of mental illness is not certain as risk is based on probability. not everyone who is exposed to a risk factor will have an adverse outcome. knowledge related to the risks for relapse is not yet well developed and it is important to realise the limitations of our understanding in this area. furthermore, the nature of risk varies in terms of the element of choice or voluntariness of the risk factors identified, which affects the extent to which the risk is amenable to intervention. the canadian association of gerontology (see health canada 1997, p8) identifies personal risks on a continuum of voluntary choice as follows: risk pursued as opportunity; freely accepted risk; reluctantly assumed risk; risk with little or no choice. thirdly, monograph 2000 states that the process of identifying risk can be biased. risk is not a neutral concept; decisions regarding what are acceptable or unacceptable levels of risk are subjective. the generalized use of the \"at - risk\" label is highly problematic and implicitly racist, classist, sexist and a 1990s version of the cultural deficit model which located problems or pathologies in individuals, families and communities rather than in institutions and structures that create and maintain inequality (swadener, lubeck 1995, p3). the process of ascribing risk can be disempowering for consumers as the assessment of risk factors is often carried out by services. asking people themselves what is important for their wellbeing can generate factors very different to those determined by a service provider. interventions can be paternalistic and at odds with the concepts of consumer empowerment and participation. \"you can put too much emphasis on relapse prevention and there's the risk of trying to be too overprotective; you can highlight vulnerability to the extent that it kind of restricts people's sense of wellbeing.\" (clinician) risk factors interact and multiple and persistent risk factors predict more strongly than any individual risk factor (mrazek, haggerty 1994; fraser 1997). addressing a single risk factor or having a short - term orientation to prevention is likely to be ineffective. these types of simplistic approaches are all too common and derive from and underlie the fragmented, sector - specific nature of many services. structural barriers can hinder intersectoral approaches and impede more multifocused, holistic and intersectoral prevention interventions. if risks are improperly identified, interventions can be targeted at the wrong factors. at best, such interventions may be ineffective and a waste of scarce resources; at worst, they may exacerbate other risk factors. an example of an intervention that may increase risk is the premature removal of children from their families in response to perceived risk and placing them in foster care or institutions. the \"stolen generation\" of aboriginal children resulted from a biased, misguided, paternalistic and racist decision to remove part - aboriginal children from the risks associated with growing up within aboriginal communities and instead provide them with the... the overzealous application of a risk approach is all too well understood by parents who have mental illness. these people risk the removal of their children when they become acutely unwell and then may have difficulty getting them back once they are well again. docs doesn't consider mental illness; it's outside of their act. if they get involved, the children just disappear. (consumer) \"you learn to make sure they (the children) don't get noticed.\" (consumer) finally, a risk approach focuses on the negative. a risk focus concentrates on weaknesses rather than strengths and can encourage an approach akin to rescuing those in need. alternatively, there is a danger that enforced intervention will be seen as desirable or even necessary. while it is important to reduce risk factors where possible and enable people to better cope with the risk factors that they can not modify, a concomitant focus on improving protective factors greatly enhances the effectiveness of interventions and is essential in order to place relapse prevention within a recovery orientation. next page. listen. table of contents. foreword. executive summary. acknowledgements. membership of the national mental health promotion and prevention working party. abbreviations. background. rationale. aims. audiences. scope. methodology. policy background. what is relapse prevention? defining relapse. defining relapse prevention. relapse prevention, recovery and rehabilitation. preliminary definitions. what is our current state of knowledge? what are the basic elements of relapse prevention? awareness, acceptance, attitude and recognition. acceptance. recognition of early warning signs. awareness of potential risk and protective factors for relapse. anticipation and planning. alternatives. accommodation. employment. economic wellbeing. education, art and other forms of meaningful activity. harmful alcohol and other drug use. physical health. social relationships. violence. resilience. wider range of treatment options. access and early intervention. the role of psychiatric disability support services. the role of the acute and specialist mental health system. the role of case management. the role of primary care including general practice. population groups with special needs. children and adolescents. older adults. aboriginal peoples and torres strait islanders. people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. rural and remote communities. forensic populations. what do we need to do to incorporate relapse prevention into continuing care? empowering consumers and their families and carers through participation and partnerships. service access and responsiveness. workforce development. information, monitoring, evaluation and research. issues for consideration. references.",

isn't installed yet and content can be converted. because of iis installation (which configmgr will do for you if you select this in the wizard), a restart may be triggered. in my case, an unexpected restart was done on a windows server 2008 r2 system. this because of an unknown msi installation. as far as i can see, only the remote differential compression (rdc) feature is installed and the microsoft visual c 2010 x64 redistributable. when distribution points are not eligible for upgrade (which they were in my case), just make sure no other roles (e.g. pxe service point then distribution point) are installed. just make sure there is enough available disk space (also need 100% free space in order to carry out conversion to configmgr 2012 content library). when removing pxe service point, clean up disk space and wait a while or reboot the server, distribution points are finally eligible for upgrade. source: microsoft technet. when looking in

be down for a few moments. furthermore, microsoft technet mentions that the configmgr 2007 client must be removed on branch distribution points only. during migration on a standard distribution point, however, the following message is displayed: failed to update binaries. after removing the configmgr 2007 client, converting content was done successfully without any problem. when migrating packages is done, the following message is displayed: completed reassign distribution point. so next time, i will remove the configmgr 2007 client on standard distribution points before migration also. be aware that only packages which are migrated to configmgr 2012 will be converted to the sccmcontentlib folder. other old packages will still be left in the old package share folder and can be removed afterwards manually. just make sure that packages migrated does not have the \"copy the content in this package to a package share on distribution points\" have selected in properties. otherwise, they will be on your new configmgr 2012 server in package share folder also. after that, you will have new distribution points running. source: microsoft technet. posted by henk hoogendoorn at 7:51 am. 0

configmgr client cache on systems is 5120mb (which is 5gb). when deploying lot of packages, this isn't enough for sure. because content remains in the cache for at least 24 hours, it can not be overwritten by new content if it requires the space. when it's needed to deploy more then 5gb within 24 hours, the client cache must be expanded or cleaned up. when the client must download new packages, you can either increase the client cache size or choose the delete option within the control panel applet of the client to delete contents of the cache. let's have a look at the possibilities. expand the configmgr client cache manually. you can change this setting directly on the client itself using the control panel applet \"cache configure settings\". expand the configmgr client cache on existing systems. just create a package with vbs file to change cache size. on error resume next dim uiresmanager dim cache dim cachesize cachesize = 10240 set uiresmanager = createobject(\"uiresource.uiresourcemgr\") set cache = uiresmanager.getcacheinfo cache.totalsize = cachesize expand the configmgr client cache on new systems. use smscachesize = 10240 to the setup windows and configmgr step in the task sequence used for deployment. use ccmsetupexe smscachesize = 10240 when starting the configmgr client installation manually. sources: microsoft technet, technet

templates. at the moment, there's v4 which is from 11/3/2014. these templates can be used to import in configmgr 2012 r2 easily. you can choose to create multiple server collections to deploy them or merge them to a single server policy. best thing is to copy them to the default folder which is configmgr folder\\adminconsole\\xmlstorage\\eptemplates. the following scep policies are enclosed. the

        "text": "german concentration camps: vittel internment camp, france. figure 1. the allies reached the vittel internees on september 13. the press caption here reads: \"yank entertains youthful internees. pfc eldon nicholas of vadillac, mich., uses a toy monkey to entertain a few of the more youthful of the 1,500 internees of the german internment camp at vittel in the vosges mountains of france.\" the internees, citizens of the united states, england, and other allied nations, were released after the arrival of french troops from gen. patton's third army. the germans would attempt to make a stand in the rugged vosges mountains. the germans, after their victory in france, set up an internment camp at a spa resort near epinal at vittel, france. it was located in the vogues mountains of northeastern france. this proved to be a rather privileged camp. vittel was one of several internierunslager ilaq administered by the german army rather than the ss. it was part of the pow camp system, although it was not for pows. they were for allied civilians, british and dominion subjects who had the misfortune to find themselves in areas occupied by the germans. by far the greatest number of allied civilians in fall of france (june 1940). france during world war i had been the bulwark against the german army in the west. few believed that france could be easily defeated, including the great majority of the leading german commanders. many saw the french army as the strongest in the world. large numbers of foreign nationals lived in france, many in paris. paris was called the city of lights. it was renowned for its toleration, culture, and beauty. there were substantial numbers of american citizens and british subjects living in france, enjoying the culture, food, and pleasant climate. when war broke out (september 1939), many, but not all, foreign nationals were arrested. arrest of foreign nationals. the germans, after their victory in france, began arresting allied nationals. they were at first placed in pow camps, not special camps. conditions were apparently deplorable. after the british managed to defeat the luftwaffe in the battle of britain and prevent a quick germany victory, a more permanent arrangement was needed. and the british began learning of the poor conditions their civilians were subjected to. one report suggests that the british threatened to send interned german civilians to northern canada. the germans established an internment camp in the resort town of vittel. united states civilian detainees joined them in 1942. establishment (may 1941). the germans decided to set up a special internment camp in 1941. they chose a spa resort near epinal at vittel, france. it was located in the vogues mountains of northeastern france. the first group of detainees arrived may 1, 1941. they were a mixed group of some 2,060 women, children, and elderly civilians. most were british. vittel proved to be a rather privileged camp. internierunslager ilaq. vittel was one of several internierunslager ilaq administered by the german army rather than the ss. it was designated frontstalag 121. vittel was thus part of the german pow camp system administered by the wehrmacht. while part of the pow camp system, it was not for pows. they were special camps for allied civilians, british and dominion subjects who had the misfortune to find themselves in areas occupied by the germans. by far the greatest number of allied civilians in german hands were in france. after hitler declared war on the united states, some americans were also held there. there. conditions. vittel (frontstalag 121) consisted of requisitioned hotels in this spa town. vittel differed significantly from the vast majority of other camps. living conditions were far better. in addition to the hotels, there was a large park the internees had access to. the hotels and parks were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards. the internees, while living in hotels, did their own cooking. unlike the situation in most german camps, there was heat and running water. as with the pow camps for western soldiers, the civilian internees at vittel were allowed to send and receive mail. and like gestapo. the wehrmacht, not the ss, was responsible for the camp. we are not entirely sure of the security arrangements. we notice that some of the internees report their luggage upon arrival was searched by gestapo agents. glass. we are not sure if they were really gestapo or other police organization or wehrmacht security officers. but because of the difference between wehrmacht and police uniforms, it seems likely that there was some police involvement. as far as we can tell, the internees were not subjected to any brutal treatment. release of elderly and youth (early 1942). the germans eventually decided to release women over 60 years, men over 75 years, and children under 16 years early 1942. this did not mean that children were released. young children remained at the camp because their parents were being held at the camp. this meant that the germans were relieved of the cost for looking after them. they were allowed to live in occupied france where they found that conditions were worse than in the camp. population. the release of the elderly and youth in 1942 reduced the camp population to about 2,400 internees. most survived the war because conditions in the camp were relatively good. german interest in exchanges. the germans, as the war continued, became increasingly interested in securing the release of germans interned in foreign countries. after the fall of france (june 1940), this meant britain and the commonwealth, the only unoccupied countries still at war with germany. this changed with the nazi invasion of the soviet union (june 1941) and declaration of war on the united states (december 1941). suddenly, substantial numbers of countries began breaking relations and/or declaring war on germany in latin america. and the number of interned germans abroad began to increase. we are not sure hitler was concerned about this, but. jews (january 1943). there were also jews at vittel, mostly german jews, including many children. the germans at first used the camp to intern british and american citizens who were living in france. this was a result of ribbentrop's effort to exchange civilian internees. he did not have many allied internees to exchange, so he came up with the idea of collecting jews with foreign passports to add to his numbers. he persuaded himmler (as the ss began the mass killings in poland) to send jews with foreign passports to vittel. unlike the british and americans, the jews mostly came from ghettos in. some 200 jews arrived at vittel from poland in january 1943. another 60 arrived in may 1943. most held foreign passports or promises of citizenship obtained from latin american countries. other jews with foreign passports arrived from france and other german - occupied countries in western europe. these jews were kept separate from the western internees but enjoyed similar living conditions. without exception, it was a vast improvement over what they had been enduring. ribbentrop failed to arrange exchanges. tragically, latin american countries showed little interest in such exchanges. they generally refused to honor the citizenship papers issued to jews by their consulates. nor did. liberation (september 1944). unlike the ss camps, wehrmacht commanders at vittel made no effort to evacuate the camp as the allies approached. free french forces were an important part of the forces that landed in southern france as part of operation dragoon. and they expanded as the french resistance joined them as they moved north and became part of the right flank of the allied forces liberating france. thus, the free french were part of the allied forces that moved into the vosges mountains, driving toward the rhine. it was the free french that liberated vittel on september 12, 1944. individual accounts. we note one pot about vittel. my father and his sister and brother and his father were interned at the vittel concentration camp. they were cuban jews living in paris and were sent to vittel. they suffered and lost everything and were eventually traded for german soldiers imprisoned in cuba. they were sent to spain and then another 2 years went by and they finally arrived in cuba. the rest of my father's family were gassed in auschwitz. schilling. sources: glass, charles. under nazi occupation: life and death under

        "text": "in enemies, regular enemies, deathless: raidriar. \"you will face me. we will end this.\" raidriar challenges the worker of secrets. raidriar (raidriar or jori in infinity blade ii). information: type: regular enemy. subtype: deathless. alias: the god king. weapon: the infinity blade (ib1 - 3). armor: helio armor (ib1 - helio plate, ib2 - ib3). shield: sunstorm (ib1 - epsilon, ib2 - ib3). helmet: helio helm (ib1 - helio crown, ib2 - 3). multiplayer stats: attack: 60. bonus: 15. chain: 5. speed: 5. raidriar in infinity blade 1: raidriar (raid - ree - are) born as jori, also known as the god king, is the main antagonist of infinity blade i and ii, and the tritagonist of infinity blade iii. after ausar's fall, he ruled most of the planet together with a pantheon of seven deathless, of which he was the leader. he does not live in the temple of lantimor found in infinity blade i, but only comes there when the next descendant of the bloodline is ready to face him. he most likely lives in his stronghold at larioth, as revealed in infinity blade iii. contents show: history: early life: not much is known about raidriar's early life other than thousands of years ago, he was known as jori, the son of a man named uriel, who worked for a corporate businessman known as mr. galath. he and his father were never close because of uriel's time - consuming job. when jori was hit by a car, uriel brought him to galath, who used his advanced knowledge of the qip and machinery to transform jori into a deathless. at some point in his immortal life, he hunted down ausar, the vile, and managed to defeat him under mysterious circumstances, though most likely by luck/chance, obtaining the infinity blade in the process. he then formed the pantheon and took control of the world with no one left to challenge him. infinity blade: the god king is the enemy of the final battle of each bloodline. he is reborn every time he is destroyed. after obtaining the infinity blade, siris may access the dungeon which leads to a rebirth chamber with several raidriar buds in green tubes, without the helio armor shoulder guards. raidriar uses the infinity blade, helio helm, sunstorm, and helio armor. he increases by 50 levels every time he is defeated. siris is able to obtain all raidriar's armor and weapons. once raidriar's health is reduced by one third, he will disarm siris and offer him a chance to learn the true meaning of power. if the player taps the weapon, the fight continues and raidriar will now unleash his fury attacks. after defeating raidriar, siris drops his shield and sword and disarms raidriar. raidriar then says they will come for siris next, and he kills raidriar. after this, the credits roll and then another cut scene starts. siris looks around the room before approaching the raidriar's throne, where he presses a button that activates a giant hologram machine. the machine... saydhi for going too far. after this, the credits roll and the next bloodline starts. infinity blade awakening: raidriar was reborn in his seventh temple of reincarnation after siris had defeated him in battle. he claims that he allowed siris to defeat him. he is referred to as raidriar by his devoted mortals that serve him. raidriar uses technology only available to the deathless to learn how he lost the duel against siris. raidriar learns that the infinity blade was not fully activated when he lost; however, it was powerful enough to kill the lesser deathless that were imprisoned in his dungeon. raidriar believes that the infinity blade may be fully activated now and is terrified by the thought of a true death. raidriar reviews the video of his isa, who initially attempts to kill siris and retrieve the blade. raidriar gathers several dark knights and sets out to meet with the worker of secrets. as siris learns of the god king's rebirth, he sets out with isa to find another deathless, saydhi, that can help siris find the worker of secrets. after siris kills saydhi, he inserts the infinity blade in a slot similar to the one in raidriar's dungeon, causing siris to lose possession of the infinity blade and raidriar to gain it. he tells siris of their intertwined past. siris is actually ausar, who is deathless himself. infinity blade ii: raidriar in infinity blade 2: in infinity blade ii, it is revealed by the worker of secrets and the archivist that the god king's true name is raidriar, and ausar. siris can only free the worker by trapping raidriar in his place. when siris arrives at saydhi's estate, he challenges raidriar to a duel, shouting his name and waiting for him to arrive. the latter arrives with a plated guard, an iron butcher, and an iron sentinel. he commands his minions to best siris, but not to kill him, instead saving him for the infinity blade. siris survives and faces the god king himself. siris then bests him. raidriar reveals that killing him will not end siris' goal to free mankind from the deathless. siris then hits raidriar with the pommel of the blade and brings him back to saranthia to free the worker. however, the worker betrays siris, thanking him for defeating raidriar, his rival, and revealing that siris, as ausar at the time, was actually the one who imprisoned him and tricks siris into imprisonment. infinity blade redemption: raidriar and siris are imprisoned for two years, during which they kill each other thousands of times. when isa finally rescues siris, raidriar surprises them, slitting his throat in order to escape. raidriar awakens back in his castle, learning that the worker has instated a soulless copy of raidriar in his stead. forced to kill his own devoted, who believe he is an imposter, raidriar seeks out his still - loyal high devoted, eves, and sets out to find siris. convincing siris that they must ally, raidriar sends him to kill the false god king and retrieve the infinity blade. while siris is away, the worker of secrets bombs the camps of siris' rebellion, killing almost everyone. siris returns and is eventually persuaded to give raidriar the infinity blade so that he can seek out the worker and end him. raidriar reaches the worker's bunker and fights his way to his throne. it is revealed that raidriar is jori, uriel's son, and that the worker of secrets is galath. after killing jarred with his infinity blade, raidriar faces galath, who summons his own infinity blade and bests raidriar. the worker then reveals his plan to destroy the world so that all deathless can die permanently, but tells raidriar that he will never defeat him and offers him a chance to join him, telling him that he can be a valuable asset. thinking back on his father's final words to him, to make the world better, instead of accepting galath's offer, raidriar teleports the datapod to a hidden location, sending a remote message to siris to seek it out. galath, angered, stabs raidriar. infinity blade iii: raidriar is playable during the prologue of infinity blade iii. at the beginning of infinity blade iii, raidriar reaches the worker in his tower. he fights and beats one of the worker's minions and ashimar. he then faces the worker himself. whether the player is defeated or should the player deal enough damage, the battle will end with raidriar's submission. the worker then reveals his plan to destroy the world so that all deathless can die permanently. the worker tells raidriar that he will never defeat him and offers him a chance to join him, telling him that he can be a valuable asset. in response, raidriar admits that he (siris - raidriar) instead of accepting the worker's offer, removes his datapod, alerting siris and isa and angering the worker, causing him to strike raidriar with the infinity blade, killing him permanently. presumably, the worker makes a second soulless copy of raidriar as the first was killed by siris in infinity blade redemption. the magic stats raidriar has is heal 3, incinerate 3, and freeze 3. it matches that of the magic stats of ring of ice and fire. this is a reference to infinity blade ii where siris uses the same ring in the tutorial. donald mustard has implied that raidriar is truly dead as he said, \"i saw him (raidriar) get stabbed with an activated infinity blade.\" soulless raidriar: main article: soulless raidriar. during infinity blade iii, it is shown that the soulless version of raidriar is ruling the land from raidriar's stronghold in larioth. he fights siris, but as siris is about to kill him, he kills himself, teleporting away. later in the ark, he attempts to cover the worker while he escapes, but isa takes care of him while siris pursues galath. tactics: infinity blade i: before battling the god king, the player is advised to equip a weapon with the most raw damage they have available to them, as the god king becomes immune to almost all elemental attacks after only a few bloodlines. it's also advised that the player not rush in to fight him, as his weapons' elemental attack changes often; equip shields that add resistances to those elements. it's also highly advised to have a decent magic attribute coupled with a ring with healing properties. and remember to heal fully with a health potion. it's highly advised that the player stick to parrying the god king's standard attacks, because the small windows from block and dodge breaks won't provide a good opportunity to dish out damage at all. when the god king gets cut down by 1/3 of his health, he gives you a choice to join him or die. if you choose to serve him by tapping on him, he'll praise you for your wisdom and a secret achievement, \"not in kansas\" will be unlocked. by tapping on your weapon, he will become angered and start to attack more aggressively, by now using... after the fight, the player will be taken on to the next bloodline regardless of results; if he has beaten the god king, he will raise his level by 50. however, if the player has lost the battle, the god king shall remain at his current level. the god king drops a significant, though level - dependant, amount of gold and a guaranteed item. it should be noted that the god king will rarely drop the infinity blade, as he always drop gold or random things. infinity blade ii: raidriar fights similar to any other normal - sized enemy, but with faster movements. he also has three unique fury combos, all of which include unblockable moves. it is recommended to parry these combos before he can execute them if you can. an alternative solution is to obtain a \"on 4 - combo block all attacks\" gem for light weapon class, which will allow you to block his shield bashes in the fury chains. the vault of tears update allows raidriar to fire off light magic much like saydhi and thane. you can parry, dodge, or, at a cost to 5 odd units of damage to your shield/two - handed weapon, block these attacks. take note, even if raidriar fires magic to the left or right of your character, you must dodge to the opposite side to avoid taking damage. it is also recommended that you at least create a rare defense gem to shrug off his attack element, whichever that element is. if he is at a very high level, stick with anything that is extremely high in stats, like the infinity blade. heavy weapons can also be effective if you... dialogue: infinity blade i: prologue: raidriar: \"welcome. it has been many centuries since a mortal has dared challenge me. i commend you for your bravery. tell me, hero, what do you call yourself?\" siris/first ancestor: \"i am the voice of freedom and i will end your tyranny and bring peace to this land.\" raidriar: \"mwahaha. a bold reply and one of the most entertaining i've yet heard. you will do nicely.\" begin (tutorial ends) raidriar: \"enough. you are a cunning warrior and fight with strength and skill. we have found our catalyst.\" (summons the infinity blade) \"the infinity blade. the god killer. it took me millennia to find.\"",

ireland hurling final, it seems only fitting that the history of ireland's national game are discussed. hurling is arguably the fastest field sport in the world and quite possibly the oldest. it is played with sticks called hurleys, a ball known as a sliotar, and by two teams of 15 who play on a large pitch with goals at either end. the rules of the modern game were first codified by the gaelic athletic association in the late 19th century, but prior to this there were actually two hurling traditions on the island of ireland (see o'maolfabhail 1973). in the north of the country, a winter game very similar to modern scottish shinty was played, mainly on the ground, with a narrow stick and a hard ball. the second form of the game, or leinster hurling, was played with a broader hurley and a softer ball and was much more like the modern game. players could pick up the ball, catch and strike it, as well as soloing down the field. although the gaa used both forms as an martin driscoll martindriscoll.com. the earliest surviving references to hurling are found in 7th and 8th century ad irish laws, which describe various sporting injuries that should be compensated. hurling is also mentioned in the 11th - 12th century leabhar na huidre, while further descriptions are to be found in 13th - 14th century romantic tale cath mhaigh tuireadh chunga (ibid, p33). this latter account details a very bloody hurling game between the tuatha de danna and the fir bolg that was played at moytura, co mayo. this mythical match supposedly took place in 1072 bc, the bronze age. however, the most famous early account of the hurling is found in the tain bo cuailgne, which describes the exploits of the ulster hero cu chullainn. although the surviving version of this epic dates from the 12th century, it has been convincingly argued that the story's origins lie in the iron age (500 bc - 400 ad). hurling is mentioned a number of times in the text, most notably when the young hero then known as setanta uses a hurley and sliotar to kill a vicious hound. henceforth, he became known as cu chulainn (cullen's hound after the owner of the dog). kells high cross. possible representations of hurling are also found on two high crosses from kells and monsterboice which date from 9th - 10th centuries ad. on each of these crosses, a biblical panel is depicted which illustrates david killing a lion with what appears to be a curved stick and ball. the killing instrument should in fact be a sling, but it appears that a hurley was chosen instead as it may have been more familiar to an irish audience (o'sullivan 1998, 34). hurling continues to feature in later medieval gaelic irish and english sources, with the latter generally disapproving. it is hard to believe it now, but in the 14th century that bastion of the modern game, killkenny, attempted to ban hurling. this occurred in 1367 when the infamous statutes of kilkenny declared \"do not henceforth use the plays which men call horlings with great sticks and a ball upon the ground from which great evils and maims have arisen\". despite threats of fines and imprisonment, this law failed miserably and the black - and - amber - clad men of kilkenny would become one of hurling's powerhouses. similar measures to curtail hurling were also undertaken in galway. these statutes, which were enacted in 1527, stated that people should \"at no time to use ne occupy ye hurling of ye litill balle with the hookie sticks or staves\". thankfully, as in kilkenny, these laws seem to have had little lasting effect. galloglass grave slab. jim dempsey. deb snelson. megalithicireland.com. indeed, the game appears to have been widely played in the latter middle ages. in the far north of the country, for example, a 15th century galloglass's grave slab from co donegal clearly depicts a sword, hurley and sliotar (see image to the left). similarly, in the south of the country, hurling was so prevalent that the lord chancellor william gerrarde was forced to reprimand the english settlers of the munster plantation for playing the game in 1587. in the post - medieval period, hurling continued to prosper, often under the patronage of the anglo - irish gentry. these matches drew large crowds and many colourful accounts of these games survive. for example, in 1792, a hurling match took place in the phoenix park, dublin, in front of a vast concourse of spectators, \"with much agility and athletic contention until the spectators forced into the playing ground\" (king 2005, p18). similarly, in 1827, a game at callan, co kilkenny is described thus: \"it was a good game. the sticks were being brandished like swords. hurling is a warlike game. the west side won the first match and the east the second. you could hear the sticks striking the ball from one end of the green to the other\" (diaries of amhlaoibh o suilleabhain). inter - village and sometimes inter - county hurling matches flourished throughout the 19th century. indeed, they were to inspire a new and dynamic sporting organisation. in 1884, nearly 2000 years after setanata first drove a sliotar towards cullen's onrushing hound, the gaelic athletic association was founded. the rest, as they say, is history. by colm moriarty. further reading on the history of hurling: o'sullivan, a. 1998. warriors, legends and heroes: the archaeology of hurling in archaeology ireland autumn 1998. o'maolfabhail, a. 1973. caman, 2000 years of hurling in ireland. dundalk. king, s.j. 2005. a history of hurling. dublin. about colm. view all posts by colm. connect with us on social media. subscribe to our email newsletter to receive updates. cu chulainn, hurling, hurling history, ireland. orkney excavation reveals stunning neolithic site. viking exhibition and longphort conference. dundalk county museum. this site uses akismet to reduce spam. learn how your comment data is processed. our shop.",

        "text": "4. utterance boundaries. determining where the boundaries fall between utterances is an important part of your job as a transcriber. lots of segments of speech qualify as utterances: a word, a short phrase, or a complex sentence with many embedded clauses. unfortunately, people don't speak with periods, commas, and question marks to let you know when one utterance ends and another one begins. the following guidelines have been developed to help you break continuous human speech into single utterances that fit into excel spreadsheet cells. it is in this format that we can further analyze human speech into words per utterance, clauses per. 4.1. what is an utterance? an utterance can be a word, a phrase, or an entire sentence. the following are all potential examples of utterances: ok, uhhuh, not on the floor, the pink one, yeah, well i thought she was going to but she never did, bugs lives outside, honey we don't bring them in the house. 4.2. transcribe for pauses of 2 seconds or less. if the speaker hesitates to find a word, treat it as one utterance unless the speaker pauses for more than two seconds. if there is less than a two - second pause, put two dashes in for the hesitation and a space on either side of the dashes. any time there is a pause of more than two seconds, transcribe it as two separate utterances (see also section 4.5.1). p_utts put it in the toy box. 4.3. self - corrected speech is one utterance. if the speaker interrupts herself to correct herself, treat it as one utterance, putting two dashes between the original and the corrected words and a space on either side of the dashes. p_utts don't do that, nathan jake. 4.4. self - interrupted speech requires multiple utterances. if the speaker interrupts herself to express an entirely different thought, treat it as two separate utterances and put a space and two dashes after the first utterance. p_utts why don't you put it, don't do that. 4.5. false starts are one utterance. if the speaker has a false start in her speech, treat it as one utterance and put two dashes surrounded by spaces between the repeated utterances. false starts are instances when a speaker begins to say something, hesitates, and then resumes saying the same thing. p_utts will you, will you go to your room. 4.5.1. a pause of more than 2 seconds requires a new utterance. in the case of false starts, if there is a two - second or greater pause between the repeated phrases, then do start a new utterance. p_utts context will you, 3 - second pause, will you go to your room. 4.5.2. unfinished utterances end with. if the speaker has a false start and then trails off without completing her sentence or phrase, just end the utterance with two dashes. 4.5.3. speaker stumbling over words is one utterance. if the speaker stumbles over his or her words while trying to formulate an utterance, still count this as a false start and transcribe the attempts on a single utterance line. to count as a false start, the words must be spoken very quickly or be otherwise clearly an attempt at verbalizing a single thought. for example, p_utts c_utts no, don't, oh no, where, what, where did you put it. 4.6. utterances never span more than one conversational turn. an utterance is never more than one conversational turn. when people are taking turns talking, having a conversation, a single utterance will never span over more than one person's turn. recall that in section 3.2, when a person is interrupted and doesn't acknowledge the interruption, this is still a single conversational turn. 4.7. utterances are never more than one complete sentence. an utterance is never more than one complete sentence long. a sentence is a segment of speech containing a subject and a predicate. complete sentences include things like the man is walking and i'm sleepy. if sentences are joined by conjunction words like and, or, but, because, after, for, so, if, when, etc., then it's okay to transcribe them together on a single utterance line, but if there are no conjunction words, the sentences should be separate utterances. for example, the following could be utterances: but you said you would, the one that's right over there, i'll go first and then you can have a turn, if i tag you, you have to go to jail, i wanted to throw it but then i remembered not to because then i would get in trouble, he keeps hiding. and the following should never be transcribed as single utterances: get your coat, it's time to go, you know what, let's do this inside, bring it to me later, i'm busy right now. 4.7.1. conditional constructions in aave. especially in african - american vernacular english (aave), it is common to create if - then constructions while omitting the words if and then. you might, for example, hear somebody say you leave your jacket off, you're going to get cold, meaning if you leave your jacket off, then you're going to get cold. transcribe constructions such as these on a single utterance line, even if the connecting words technically are not present. 4.8. use semantic and syntactic cohesion to determine utterance boundary. in general, when phrases are related semantically and grammatically, they should be transcribed together as one utterance if there is less than a two - second pause between them. for instance, the phrases i'll go first and and then you can have a turn are related semantically because after i'll go first is the time when you can have a turn, and the conjunction words and then connect the phrases to each other grammatically. another example are the phrases are you having fun and on the couch. these are related semantically because on the couch is a place where you could. in most cases, utterances like the ones above should be transcribed as follows: p_utts c_utts i'll go first and then you can have a turn, are you having fun on the couch. but occasionally, people will add something as sort of an afterthought that could have been related semantically and grammatically to the rest of the utterance but isn't part of the original train of thought. in cases where speaker adds a phrase more as an afterthought than as part of the original utterance, transcribe the phrases as separate utterances like this: p_utts c_utts i'll go first and then you can have a turn, are you having fun on the couch. but how can we determine whether two phrases are part of the same train of thought or not? use the guidelines in 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 to determine whether you have strong enough evidence to break up two phrases that could be semantically and grammatically related. 4.8.1. a pause of more than 2 seconds trumps semantic - syntactic cohesion. if there is a two - second or longer pause in between phrases, transcribe them as two separate utterances instead of a single utterance, even if they are semantically and syntactically cohesive. p_utts c_utts context are you having fun, at least 2 full seconds of pause after fun, on the couch, i'll go first, at least 2 full seconds of pause after first, and then you can have a turn. 4.8.2. use intonational contours to help determine utterance boundary. if two phrases are part of two totally separate intonational contours, transcribe them as two separate utterances instead of a single utterance. intonational contour refers to the pattern the pitch of your voice makes when you utter questions, propositions, and commands. linguists have formed nuanced and complex theories about the intonational contour patterns of different languages, but for the purposes of transcribing, you only need to know the following principles, which we will illustrate using the example of a question. when you form a question in english, you usually raise the pitch of your voice at the end, like this. the rising line represents the way your voice goes up at the end of the question. an utterance with this intonational contour pattern would be transcribed on one line. if you form two distinct questions, however, your voice will do something like this. your voice's pitch rises twice because you've asked two questions with two intonational contours. this example would be transcribed as two utterances on two separate lines. sometimes you will encounter a complex intonational contour pattern where there are two segments of a larger intonational pattern. such a contour would look something like this. the above example still has a single intonational contour, even though that contour is complex, and should be transcribed as a single utterance on a single line. 4.9. tag words and phrases. people often use tag words and phrases in their speech. a tag is a word or short phrase that frames or clarifies the rest of the sentence or phrase and usually occurs at the beginning or end of an utterance. 4.9.1. tags to transcribe on the same line. when you encounter tags like the ones in the table below, err on the side of them on the same utterance line as the speech they accompany instead of on their own separate line. the tags below (not an exhaustive list) either do not have a verb or are sentence fragments without a subject. because they are not full sentences, there is no prohibition against putting them on the same utterance line as another sentence. however, just as is the case with phrases that are connected structurally, there are times when you should transcribe tag words and phrases such as 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 regarding pauses and intonational contours to decide when to transcribe a non - sentence tag word or phrase as its own separate utterance. examples of tag words and phrases: tag word/phrase appearing at the beginning appearing at the end ok ok can we go now i get it ok honey honey will you put your toys away it's in the kitchen honey right right first the top then the bottom put it in the oven right well well not without your brother na here here let me do this na no no not the blue one na oh boy oh boy you're in for a treat na my goodness my goodness that was a big burp na mommy mommy help me i want down mommy remember remember no running in the kitchen i put those in your toy box remember see see it's not so scary it's up on top see look at look at they're picking vegetables na 4.9.2. transcribe inverted auxiliary tag questions. at the end of a sentence, an inverted question can also be a tag. these tags are formed by taking the auxiliary verb (or do if there isn't an explicit auxiliary verb) and forming a negated question from it. err on the side of transcribing inverted tag questions on the same utterance line as the speech they accompany. tag question appearing at the beginning appearing at the end isn't it na that's the right answer isn't it do we na we don't need to watch tv right now do we aren't you na you're a little cranky today aren't you didn't you na you saw your friend at the store today didn't you 4.9.3. tags to transcribe on a separate line. sometimes you will hear complete sentences spoken like tags. do not transcribe complete sentence tags on the same utterance line as another sentence, even if they really, really sound like they go together. this would be a violation of rule 4.7. if a speaker says: i know it's so crazy. i know it's so crazy. i don't know, maybe we should wait until after dinner. i don't know, maybe we should wait until after dinner. you know what, let's put the toys away first. you know what, let's put the toys away first. there you go, it's all fixed. there you go, it's all fixed. you see, all three things are the same color. you see, all three things are the same color. 4.9.4. tags vs multiclause utterances. you may notice that a subset of these tags, such as i know and you see, could actually be the beginning of a sentence without being a tag. for example, a speaker might say i know it's so crazy, meaning...",

        "text": "why music math? this course will touch on areas of music math, which adds a different perspective to the traditional conversation about music theory. i think it is very helpful from time to time to look at musical principles from a mathematical perspective, and it helps to link music theory to other areas of the earlham curriculum. musical ratio and musical proportion: ratio as relationship. what is a ratio in mathematics? according to the excellent website mathpage, \"a ratio is the spoken language of arithmetic. it is the language with which we relate quantities of the same kind.\" a ratio is therefore a relationship between two quantities. if you have 10 and i only have 5, the fact that you have two times more dollars than me is the ratio 2:1. if a kind friend gives each of us 5, you are still richer than me, but the relationship, i.e., the ratio of our money has changed. you now have 15, i have 10, thus you now have three dollars for every two of my dollars, which is the ratio 3:2. if we invest our money and we each increase our sum tenfold, we are both happier people, but our relationship has not changed. your 150 and my 100 remains in the relationship in the ratio of 3:2. proportion is related to ratio and simply shows that two ratios are the same. no matter how much our money increases or decreases, if the ratios remain the same, their proportions remain identical. this matters, of course, for music, since two notes an octave apart may have different frequencies, but as long as they remain octaves, they are in direct proportion to one another. i know that all this is likely obvious and trivial, but it's worth stating this clearly before we move on to the musical application of ratio. simple musical ratios. a musical interval is a mathematical ratio. as we saw in the legend of pythagoras and the blacksmith shop on the previous page, the simplest ratios, when measured on the monochord, produce musical intervals that are most pleasing to the ear. when pythagoras measured the hammers from the blacksmith shop, he discovered them to be in exact low - integer relationship to each other. when he then created the monochord and moved the bridge along the string, measuring the relationship of the two distances on both sides of the bridge, he took note of the ratios between the two sides of the bridge and discovered them also to be in precise low - integer relationships with each other. this straightforward image is worth holding in your mind as you think of simple musical ratios. here we'll derive these ratios a little bit more mathematically. the simple ratios that i want you to know at this point are: octave as 2:1, perfect fifth as 3:2, perfect fourth as 4:3, pythagorean whole tone as 9:8. let's see how these ratios are derived. octave as 2:1 or in pythagorean terms 12:6. the octave 2:1 is of course the most basic ratio or relationship in music. it occurs naturally when women and men or men and children sing together. it is fundamentally the relationship of one thing vibrating twice as much as another thing. there are a number of ways to think of this. if you play a string, then stop the string at half its length, it will sound exactly an octave higher. if you play a string, then play another string that is exactly twice its length, it will sound an octave lower. ignoring the physics of physical tension and string construction, this is how a harp is designed. a string twice as long sounds an octave lower. the piano in this sense is just a harp with hammers. if you play a tube closed at one end and play a similar tube that is twice its length, the second tube will sound an octave lower. if you measure the tension on a tuned drum head and then precisely double that tension, it will sound an octave higher. regardless of how you think of it physically, 2:1 is a fundamental principle of harmonic relationship. if a string or tube vibrates at frequency , then 2f will sound an octave higher and f/2 will sound an octave lower. this results in an exponential curve as regards frequency but in a linear curve as regards our perception of octave relationship. as the frequency of a pitch doubles in value, the musical relationship remains that of an octave. thus for any given frequency, rising octaves can be expressed by the formula f2^x, where x is a whole number. so for a frequency of 275 (the lowest a on the piano), an octave higher is 2752^1 = 55. an octave above that is 2752^2 (two squared) or 2754 = 110. an octave above that is 2752^3 (two cubed) or 2758 = 220, and the octave above that is 2752^4 or 27516 = 440, which is the standard tuning note for the orchestra. thus octaves rise exponentially as 275, 55, 110, 220, 440, 880, 1760 and 3520 (the fundamental frequency of the highest a on the piano). every octave is twice the frequency of the previous octave. for the pythagoreans, they calculated the octave as being a ratio of 12:6, which is a proportion of the fundamental octave 2:1. this allowed for the remaining intervals to be calculated using only positive integers. let's look at how that worked. what we will discover is that the arithmetic mean between the octave is 3:2 and the harmonic mean between the octave is 4:3. these are the intervals of the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth respectively. when adding intervals together, you multiply their ratios, thus 4:33:2 = 12:6 = 2:1, which is the octave. this explains why when adding intervals together that are inversions of each other, they result in the perfect octave, even though arithmetically 4 + 5 = 9. perfect fifth as 3:2 from the arithmetic mean between the octave. what i find useful and interesting is that for the earliest music theorists, the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth were both considered to be the mean tone or the midpoint between the octave. they were each derived, however, by two different mathematical calculations. the importance of this is to stress the centrality of the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth in all subsequent theories of music, and to demonstrate mathematically why they exist as reciprocal inversions of each other. taking 12:6 as the fundamental expression of the octave proportion, the pythagoreans defined the perfect fifth as resulting from calculating the arithmetic mean. the arithmetic mean or midpoint between two numbers is the what we normally mean when we say \"take the average\". this can be expressed algebraically as (a + b)/2. for example, the arithmetic mean between 4 and 6 is 5, which is obvious but can be expressed in a formula as (4 + 6)/2 = 5. this is how the pythagoreans derived the interval of the perfect fifth. divide the string of the monochord into 12 equal parts. take the octave to be 12:6. take the perfect fifth to be the arithmetic mean between 12 and 6. this results in the simple calculation (12 + 6)/2 = 18/2 = 9. thus the ratio of the octave to the fifth is 9:6, which can be reduced to 3:2 by, of course, dividing each side of the ratio by 3. perfect fourth as 4:3 from the harmonic mean between the octave. the main point in discussing these musical means is that the perfect fourth was also derived from finding the mean or midpoint between the octave, but instead of using the arithmetic mean, it made use of the harmonic mean. what is the harmonic mean? well, in a series, the difference between the first and second terms in the series is related to the difference between the second and third as the first term is related to the third. algebraically we could say a/c = a - b/b - c or put another way b = 2ac/(a + c). since in the example above the arithmetic mean between 4 and 6 was 5, the harmonic mean would be 246/(4 + 6)= 48/10 = 4.8. while a visit over to the wikipedia page on the harmonic mean shows its complexity, as does the page on the pythagorean means in general, for the purposes of this specific discussion, we need only use this formula to find the harmonic mean between the 12:6 octave. using the formula b = 2ac/(a + c), we get 2126/(12 + 6)= 144/18 = 8. thus the ratio of the perfect fourth is 8:6, which can be reduced down to 4:3 by, of course, dividing each side by 2. for millennia this has been diagrammed in the following way. we see here the octave as 12:6 reduced to 2:1. we see the perfect fifth as either 9:6 or 12:8, which can both be reduced to 3:2. we see the perfect fourth as either 8:6 or 12:9, which can both be reduced to 4:3. we can see too that the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth are in a reciprocal relationship with one another. up a fifth is the same as down a fourth. up a fourth is the same as down a fifth. thus are derived the fundamental intervals of the perfect fourth and perfect fifth as the arithmetic and harmonic means respectively between the octave. as an aside, and about which we'll have more to say later, the third pythagorean mean, the geometric mean, results in the diminished fifth, which is the irrational number 2, the devil in music indeed. pythagorean whole tone as 9:8 or the space between the two means. finally, we can discover the final essential pythagorean interval, which is the pythagorean whole tone. from the diagram above, we can see the space between the overlapping fourths and fifths. it is expressed here as the ratio of 9:8. this is the fundamental pythagorean whole tone. this pythagorean whole tone can also be derived mathematically as the difference between the results of the arithmetic and harmonic means. to find the difference between ratios, they must be divided. 3:2 divided by 4:3 is the same as 3:2 multiplied by 3:4 (to divide fractions, take the reciprocal of one fraction and multiply), 3:23:4 = 9:8, the pythagorean whole tone. it is also worth discovering this same pythagorean whole tone if we add two fifths together and then divide by an octave. here's the math on that. two perfect fifths added together is calculated by multiplying their ratios, 3:23:2 = 9:4. if we use our modern language and think in the key of c major, then this would be c up to g and then g up to the d (the octave and a fifth above the c). to bring that 9:4 ratio down an octave, we must divide by 2 or multiply by 1:2, 9:41:2 = 9:8, our pythagorean whole tone (c up to d in a major scale). the pythagorean circle of fifths. since the fifth was considered the perfect ratio, as was its reciprocal, the perfect fourth, by means of its being derived by the simplest of mathematical ratios, the pythagoreans concluded that musical scales could and indeed should be constructed solely through using perfect fifths and reducing them down by octaves. if we start on a low c and go up by fifths, we would end up with the five notes of our basic c major pentatonic scale. this stack of perfect fifths, all derived from 3:2 ratios (c, g, d, a, e), could be brought into a single octave, resulting in the pitches c, d, e, g, and a. theoretically, this stacking of perfect fifths could be carried on until one reached b. on the piano and on other equal - tempered instruments, b = c, but in actuality, the math doesn't quite work out. this results in the pythagorean comma, the subject of the following page. next: pythagorean comma",

up shots for a scene in the raccoon (season 1, episode 10). landon told the editor to \"see how it plays. i think she (melissa) can carry the scene on her own.\" she did, and better material was written for her after that. . html5. mary ingalls going blind. her most challenging acting experience was going blind in season four. melissa knew her character went blind in the books and confronted michael landon about it, but \"i told her to trust me,\" landon said. she worked hard to make the character believable. \"i went to the foundation for the junior blind for specific instructions on how a young person adjusts to recent blindness,\" anderson said. \"it was the only time in the history of television that a series regular had lost their sight and not gotten it back ever.\" . html5. for her performance in ill be waving as you drive away, melissa was nominated for an emmy in the category outstanding lead actress in a drama series. she did not win, but it put her on the map. little house education. the same day melissa was nominated for her emmy (august 10, 1978), she graduated from high school at age 15. only one month a year was spent at flintridge sacred heart academy in la canada flintridge, because her education was with her onset tutor, mrs. minniear. \"mrs. minniear was terrific, the perfect combination of charm and discipline. i learned a lot from her.\" she learned a lot from michael landon too, by watching him direct on the set. one day landon turned to her and said, \"you want to be a director? watch this.\" landon appreciated her inquisitive nature. \"she's not only a beautiful, talented actress,\" landon said, \"but she's bright and curious. by the time she's 20, she'll be able to star and direct.\" michael landon teaching melissa sue anderson behind - the - camera techniques. photo courtesy of nbcuniversal pictures. little house accolades. widely recognized for her little house work, she shared the western heritage award for fictional television drama in 1975 with ed friendly, michael landon, karen grassle and melissa gilbert. in 1980, she accepted the tp de oro award in spain for best foreign actress (mejor actriz extranjera), and she was inducted into the great western performers hall of fame by the national cowboy western heritage museum in 1998. life other than little house. during little house on the prairie, michael landon asked her to play his former girlfriend in his autobiographical tv movie the loneliest runner. . html5. for her portrayal in the abc afterschool special which mother is mine, she won a daytime emmy award for outstanding individual achievement in children's programming. . html5. in 1981, she was nominated best young motion picture actress for the youth in film awards for the psychological thriller happy birthday to me. she also appeared in popular tv series including love boat, fantasy island and murder she wrote, plus playing the first lady in the tv mini - series 105 apocalypse. michael sloan: writer, producer, husband. melissa did not meet future husband michael sloan until she was cast in the series alfred hitchcock presents with michael as writer and executive producer. they also worked together on the equalizer and tv movies memories of manon, the return of sam mccloud and earthquake in new york. when melissa and michael together pitched michael landon on doing where pigeons go to die, landon made melissa an associate producer on the project. family. melissa and michael married march 17, 1990. daughter piper was born february 15, 1991, and her son griffin arrived on june 14, 1996. melissa decided to devote more time to her children and less time on acting. \"i decided to retire when i had my kids and to work only occasionally for friends. i never wanted to see that look on my children's faces.\" the look was michael landon's daughter being ignored at her own birthday party while her dad was being mobbed by fans. in 2010, melissa published her memoir the way i see it: a look back at my life on little house. melissa says, \"i have enjoyed putting my children first and being at home with them day in and day out. as much as i enjoyed my career, i have been even happier playing my parent role. i've worked very hard; it is the most difficult job there is and by far the most rewarding. i'm confident i made the right decision for me and for our family. my kids are both terrific individuals and i'm proud to be their mother.\" since then, her children have grown up and moved on, so melissa is working on new projects such as the brits are coming, which is in post -

        "text": "notice: this information has been archived and may contain outdated content. thursday, november 7, 2002. swine general. question: i would like some information on castration of older pigs. answer: it will be a real chore to castrate a mature boar (6 months or older). he must be restrained in a fashion that will not allow him to move around, especially to the point where he will not be able to injure someone. then you will need a very sharp knife and disinfectant. he should then be kept in an area that is reasonably clean, free of mud, manure, etc., and probably with some bedding. how long after castration prior to slaughter? at least until the wound incisions heals. my professional opinion is that you should use a veterinarian to. castration (the surgical removal of the two testicles) is a routine management practice for male pigs destined for slaughter. the testicles produce sperm and the male hormone testosterone. pork from boars or uncastrated male pigs at slaughter weight may have an odor during cooking that is very offensive to many people. this is called a boar odor or a tainted odor. various techniques are used for castration. the position of the animal during surgery and the method and degree of restraint are dictated by the age and size of the animal. the best time to castrate a pig is between 1 and 21 days of age. young pigs are easier to hold or restrain. they bleed less from surgery and may have antibody protection from the sows colostrum. pigs can be successfully castrated on day one. one of the major disadvantages of castrating early is that scrotal hernias are more difficult to detect. most scrotal hernias are genetic in origin. do. for pigs several weeks old, one person holds the pig by the rear legs while the other person does the castrating. for younger pigs, it is possible for one person to hold the pig with one hand or between the knees and also do the castration. a mechanical pig holder can be used. once the pig is restrained, clean the scrotum and surrounding area with a cotton swab soaked in a mild disinfectant. a disinfected sharp castration knife, scalpel, or razor - blade type instrument can be used to make the incision. examine the testicles before making the incision to determine if there are two of similar size. if there is a scrotal enlargement, it could indicate a scrotal hernia or rupture. do not castrate the pig unless you are trained to repair hernias. the pigs intestines will be forced through the incision. sometimes the testicle is removed before a scrotal hernia is discovered. if. if one or both testicles are not found, the pig may be a cryptorchid, meaning that the testicles failed to descend through the inguinal canal from the abdomen during development. when this condition is noticed, ear - notch the pig and make a record of it. often the testicles will descend to a normal position as the pig grows. the pig should be castrated later after the testicle presents itself. with one hand, tighten the skin over the scrotum to help expose the testicle and the site for the incision. with the castration instrument, make two incisions about as long as the testicles near the center of each. cut deeply enough to go through the outside body skin. cutting or not cutting the white membrane (tunica vaginalis) which surrounds the testicle is an individual preference and is optional on small pigs. squeeze or pop the testicles through the incision. if it is difficult to get the testicle through the incision, enlarge the incision slightly at the end closest to the. later, observe castrated animals for excess bleeding or the presence of tissue or intestines hernia. cut off any cord that may be protruding from the incision as this may serve as a wick for infection, but make sure it is not intestine. if intestines protrude, gently push them back through the opening and close up by suturing the tunica vaginalis. it is much easier to replace the intestines if the tunica vaginalis covering the testicle is not removed during castration. gilbert hollis, extension swine specialist, university of illinois.",

        "text": "end game equipment. check out this great guide by zachans on reddit on the best in - slot gear at the moment right here. first things first, let's talk about gear score (gs). gear score is a stat that is provided through equipment, which is based off of the gear rarity level, enchantment level, and generally put, the difficulty of the dungeon it was obtained from. the dungeons at level 50 have a minimum gs requirement listed in the dungeon sections that are required for you to even enter the dungeon. which is why upgrading your equipment, especially your weapon and top/bottom/suit, will be required for you to have enough gs to do certain dungeons. do note, however, that off - hand weapons, except an off - hand. however, do not mistake a higher gs to mean that the equipment is better than something else. you can have a piece of equipment that has lower gs but better rolls on basic and bonus attributes. therefore, you should always be looking at the basic and bonus attributes when comparing two pieces of equipment. however, if you are trying to get enough gs to do the level 50 dungeons, you don't really have to care about the attributes as long as you get something that gives you higher gs than what you already have, since your number one priority at this time is to enter the dungeons. maple weeb's video. your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. screenshot of this weapon was provided by honyoponyoko from the official maplestory 2 discord. to the left of the equipment name is 11, which represents the enchantment level of that equipment. underneath is the weapon attack if weapon or defense for everything else. equipment have a base value for their weapon attack/defense, but these values are adjusted based on the roll that you get for the basic attribute, as indicated by the \"items base weapon attack increased by 28.7%\" in this example. the gear score can also be seen in this example, with 762 being a result of the successful enchanting that has been done on the equipment. the basic attribute types will always be the same for that equipment name. in this example, all shiny platinum leaf - bladed swords will have \"items base weapon attack\", \"increase health\" and \"physical attack\" for the basic attributes, but these numbers will be different within a minimum and maximum value. the bonus attributes are the more important stats that you really want to keep your eye on. some pieces of equipment can only give certain types of bonus attributes. pyrros gloves give int and fire damage. balrog earrings give boss damage and attack speed, but most equipment will have random bonus attributes with a random number within a minimum and maximum value. if a bonus attribute has the max roll possible, it should indicate so with \"max\" being shown after the value. anything that is not max but is in a purple color indicates that it is a high roll and is still pretty good. as for what bonus attributes you should aim for, i am still confused as to what the priority should be, but the undisputed top two stats you should aim for are accuracy and piercing. accuracy can be obtained through accessories, but i believe they can also be obtained through weapons (need confirmation). the harder the dungeon/raid you are trying to clear, the more accuracy you will usually need. classes that put their points into dex (dexterity) may find that they can pass with 5 less accuracy (85 realistically, 110 ideally), since dex gives you accuracy as well. piercing. piercing is different from physical and magic piercing since it is affecting the damage calculation based on the enemy's defense, not their physical and magic defense, which are usually at much lower numbers than defense. you can get piercing from accessories and weapons. realistically, you want to get around 15 - 16 piercing from equipment, more is always better though, and boost it up to 19 - 20 with the piercing souvenir buff from housing (should be called scion of light). ideally, you would want to get 30 piercing. i don't know if it's possible with our version just yet. these two stats are the most important and should be prioritized the most. as for everything else, i have asked on the discord and there seems to be mixed opinions, but the general idea seems to be something like this (subject to change): accuracy, piercing caps at 30, but probably impossible to cap at the moment on release. magic/physical piercing caps at 15, but i think you don't need more than 10. total damage/boss damage/melee damage/ranged damage. from my understanding, total damage/boss damage/melee damage/ranged damage all do the same thing. however, total damage applies to all damage while the other three are more specific. as a result, total damage generally has a smaller max number on equipment while the other 3 have higher numbers. as a result, you may find it beneficial to prioritize boss damage over total damage combined with melee damage/ranged damage based on your class. attack speed is also a great stat from my understanding, as it reduces the cast time for your skills, but i am unsure of where to place it in the priority list. it does seem to be great on heavy gunners especially because of their reliance on cast times. crit damage is capped at 250 from korean sources. it is apparently a very important stat for assassins, but it may be too early to get crit damage given our current equipment available to us. same for crit rate. as for the stats that you want to get on each equipment, generally (with the exception of named equipment like balrog earrings that can give boss damage, subject to change): gemstones: attack/stat/int/dex etc; rings: piercing/accuracy; necklace: piercing/accuracy; cape: piercing/accuracy; belt: piercing/accuracy; hat: boss damage; top: boss damage; bottom: boss damage; suit: boss damage; gloves: physical piercing/magical piercing; shoes: boss damage/movement speed; weapons: piercing/physical piercing/magical piercing/boss damage/melee damage/ranged damage/total damage/accuracy",

        "text": "the origins of 10 popular christmas carols. (istock.com/artisteer) you've sung them while clutching cups of hot cocoa, cozying up around a fire, or stomping through snowdrifts. you've heard them played in shopping malls, churches, and holiday parties. you know all their words by heart. but do you know how some of the world's best - known christmas carols were created? 1. silent night the legend behind one of the most popular christmas carols in the world plays out as a sort of christmas miracle. the story goes that father joseph mohr of oberndorf, austria, was determined to have music at his christmas eve service even though the organ at his beloved st. nicholas church was broken. so he penned a poem and asked his friend franz gruber to compose a score for it that would not demand an organ. the truth, however, is a little less dramatic. in 1816, the catholic priest wrote the poem \"stille nacht, heilige nacht\" while stationed at a pilgrim church in mariapfarr, austria. when he transferred to st. nicholas's two years later, he did ask gruber to help him write guitar music for the poem, which the two performed - backed by a choir - on christmas eve of 1818. silent night was translated into english more than 40 years later by episcopal priest john freeman young, who is responsible for the version americans favor. the song has been translated into 142 languages to date. 2. santa claus is coming to town your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. penned by james haven gillespie, this jolly tune was first performed on american singer eddie cantor's radio show in 1934. but for all its mirth, its inspiration came from a place of grief. in his book \"stories behind the greatest hits of christmas,\" ace collins explains how gillespie was a vaudeville - turned - songwriter who'd fallen on hard times both financially and personally. gillespie got the call to pen a christmas tune for cantor just after learning his brother had died. initially, he rejected the job, feeling too overcome with grief to consider penning a playful holiday ditty. but a subway ride, recollecting his childhood with his brother and his mother's warnings that santa was watching, changed his mind. he had the lyrics in 15 minutes, then called in composer john coots to make up the music that would become a big hit within 24 hours of its debut. 3. hark the herald angels sing your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. the earliest incarnation of this carol was a poem penned in 1739 by charles wesley, brother of john wesley, the founder of methodism. however, the original opening line, as it appeared in his collection \"hymns and sacred poems,\" was \"hark! how all the welkin rings,\" using a rarely invoked term for heaven. anglican preacher and wesley contemporary george whitefield tweaked the opening line to the titular one we know today. in these early versions, \"hark! the herald angels sing\" was sung to several different tunes, including \"new britain.\" the jauntier tempo it's sung to today came from german composer felix mendelssohn. more than 100 years after it was written, english musician william h. cummings paired the carol to mendelssohn's cantata \"festgesang.\" while this is the variant that has caught on, it is a development unlikely to be appreciated by wesley or mendelssohn. the former believed the hymn was best sung slowly, while the latter was a strictly secular musician. 4. deck the halls this jaunty tune dates back to sixteenth - century wales, where its melody and much of the lyrics were pinched from the new year's eve song \"nos galan.\" lines like \"oh, how soft my fair one's bosom. fa la la la la la la la la\" were transformed into yuletide wishes like \"deck the halls with boughs of holly. fa la la la la la la la la.\" this musical makeover was done by scottish folk music scribe thomas oliphant, who built his reputation on old melodies with new lyrics. in 1862, his \"deck the hall\" was published in \"welsh melodies, vol. 2.\" he'd go on to become a renowned translator of songs as well as a lyricist for the court of queen victoria. but oliphant's version is not the one most commonly sung today. now called \"deck the halls,\" lines like \"fill the mead - cup, drain the barrel\" have been swapped for \"don we now our gay apparel.\" this variant became popular from revised music sheet printings made in 1877 and 1887. 5. good king wenceslas this unconventional but beloved carol dates back to 1853 when english hymn - writer john mason neale first penned its lyrics. set to the tune of the 14th - century carol \"the time is near for flowering,\" good king wenceslas focuses on the journey of a kind man who set out in terrible weather on the post - christmas holiday of saint stephen's day to provide aid to poor neighbors. this titular king was a real man, wenceslaus i, duke of bohemia, who ruled from 924 to 935 when he was assassinated by his own brother, boleslav the cruel. unlike his nefariously nicknamed sibling, wenceslaus was adored by his subjects. his great acts of charity led to him posthumously being declared a king and an eventual upgrade to sainthood. he is now the patron saint to the czech republic. 6. all i want for christmas is my two front teeth your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. this saccharine song is sung from the perspective of a child with a simple wish, and a fleet of such children was in fact its inspiration. in 1944, grade - school teacher donald yetter gardner and his wife doris sat down with a group of second - graders in smithtown, new york, to help them compose a song for christmas. while there are different versions of the origin, they all involve a bunch of children saying \"all i want for christmas is... \" it's not so much that any students wished for those absent front teeth, but more that gardner was charmed by their requests, hindered by toothless lisping. as gardner told it, he went home that night and in just 30 minutes penned the christmas tune that would earn him royalties until his death in the fall of 2004. a performance at his school of the song led to a meeting with witmark music company and ultimately to spike jones and his city slickers recording the ditty in 1948. gardner gave up his teaching job to become a music consultant and editor, and later remarked in awe of his own success, \"i was amazed at the way that silly little song was picked up by the whole country.\" 7. jingle bells though one of the most popular non - religious yuletide tunes, jingle bells was not originally conceived for christmas time at all. penned by james lord pierpont in 1850s savannah, georgia, the song originally titled \"the one horse open sleigh\" was intended to celebrate thanksgiving. the local unitarian church where he'd later play the song on the organ boasts historical markers declaring it the birthplace of jingle bells. however, some sources insist pierpont was belting the memorable melody as early as 1850 when he still lived in medford, massachusetts. debate still rages about the true birthplace of the song. jingle bells was renamed in 1857 when its lyrics and notes were first published. decades passed before it rose to prominence. yet it made history on december 16, 1965, becoming the first song broadcast in space. the crew of gemini 6, following reports of seeing santa claus, with an improvised version of jingle bells, which included bells and a harmonica that they had snuck onboard. mission control responded to the surprise serenade with \"you're too much, 6.\" 8. o tannenbaum commonly translated as \"o christmas tree,\" this carol comes from germany. the earliest version of the song dates back to the 16th century when melchior franck wrote a folk song about the tradition of bringing a small fir tree into one's home to decorate and sit beside the seasonal nativity scene. this decorating tradition and its celebratory song moved from germany to the us along with its emigrants. revisions to the lyrics were made in 1819 by joachim august zarnack and in 1824 by leipzig organist ernst anschutz. as christmas tree trimming caught on in the 1800s, \"o tannenbaum\" grew in popularity. in the past century, the song has been included on countless christmas albums as well as in such family entertainment as disney's \"swiss family robinson,\" \"ernest saves christmas,\" and \"a charlie brown christmas.\" 9. o little town of bethlehem this religious carol tells the tale of the birth of jesus and was inspired by a pilgrim's moving christmas eve experience in the holy lands. phillip brooks was a distinguished man of faith and intellect. a boston - born episcopalian preacher, he'd earned a doctorate of divinity from the university of oxford, taught at yale university, and publicly advocated against slavery during the civil war. but he's best known for penning \"o little town of bethlehem\" after a life - changing journey. in 1865, brooks rode on horseback from jerusalem to bethlehem, where he participated in the church of the nativity's five - hour long christmas eve celebration, complete with hymns. returning home, this experience proved so profound that he channeled it into the song sung in churches to this day. its first public performance was held three years later, performed by the children's choir of his church on december 27. 10. have yourself a merry little christmas your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. a carol that is at once hopeful and mournful, \"have yourself a merry little christmas\" lyrics were penned by hugh martin for a scene in the 1944 movie musical \"meet me in st. louis.\" judy garland sings the bittersweet song to her little sister, trying to cheer her up as both lament their family's move away from their hometown. but garland and director vincente minnelli weren't happy with martin's early, much more maudlin drafts. these included lines that martin would later describe as \"hysterically lugubrious,\" like \"have yourself a merry little christmas. it may be your last. faithful friends who were dear to us. will be near to us no more.\" martin initially refused to revise the lyrics, but a \"blue talking - to\" from actor tom drake set him straight. he said, \"you stupid son of a bitch,\" martin recollected. \"you're gonna foul up your life if you don't write another verse of that song.\" ultimately, martin gave the song a more hopeful leaning, first for the movie, then again in 1957 at the request of frank sinatra. for ol' blue eyes, he changed \"well, have to muddle through somehow\" to the more jolly \"hang a shining star upon the highest bough.\" the song has since become a standard in both holidays. 0. twitter subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "who we are. our mission. more than me uses education as a catalyst for transformative social change for every girl in liberia. our vision. every girl empowered. our story. it all started with a girl. at 11 years old, she was selling herself for clean drinking water when all she really wanted was to go to school. more than me was founded to meet her needs. we opened a school, the mtm academy for 150 girls and saw major progress. then ebola hit. the world didn't act quickly enough and we knew we had to fight to save her life. after spending six months on the front lines fighting ebola and seeing three students lose their families and many other children lose their own lives, we realized that our liberia's education system is a mess. 65% of primary school - age children are out of school and only 20% of students enrolled in grade 1 enroll in grade 12. with just 4 million people and 1.5 million children, liberia has tremendous potential. the ministry of education has asked us to partner with them to replicate our model in liberian schools and add capacity to the ministry to meet their priorities. we are committed to maintaining a center of excellence at our academy while also scaling our successes into pilot government schools across the country. we are committed to supporting these projects until this generation of students graduates and becomes liberia's future leaders. learn more about our programs here. why liberia? liberia, west africa, has a population of about 4 million people. the official language is english; the name liberia derives from liberty, meaning freedom. a 14 - year brutal civil war destroyed over 80% of the country's schools. the recent ebola epidemic further weakened liberia's infrastructure. liberia's education system is in a state of emergency. each one of the 25,000 applicants to the university of liberia in 2013 failed the entrance exam. 65% of primary school - age children are out of school. more than half (51%) of young people aged 15 - 24 are illiterate and approximately 73% of all women and girls in liberia are illiterate. only 17% of teachers have a tertiary degree - level qualification. only 20% of students enrolled in grade 1 enroll in grade 12. if liberia is going to build a more stable and resilient future, we cannot stand still. investing in girls is the best thing you can do. why girls? according to girlup, more than 40% of liberian girls ages 10 - 14 have never gone to school. unfortunately, young girls fall victim to the most frequently reported crime in liberia: rape. but investing in girls has huge rewards. when a girl in the developing world receives 7 or more years of education, she marries 4 years later and has 2.2 fewer children. an extra year of primary school boosts girls' eventual wages by 10 - 20%. an extra year of secondary school, 15 - 25%. when women and girls earn income, they reinvest 90% of it into their families as compared to only 30 - 40% for a man. for girls to get to a place where they feel secure, there needs to be education for all. gbv will only end if we take a strong stance against it. our stance on gender - based violence(gbv). 65% of the 1,002 cases reported in 2013 concerned victims aged between 3 and 14, yet just 137 cases came to court and only 49 rapists were convicted. liberia's rape laws, which only came into effect in 2006, classify rape as intentional penetration of a penis, another body part or an object into the vagina or anus of another person without that person's consent or sexual intercourse between a person who is over 18 years of age and a person who is not yet 18 years of age, even if the younger person agreed to the act or was not forced into it. the punishment is life imprisonment, though it is rarely enforced. liberia established criminal court e in 2008, a special court where sexual and gender - based violence cases are tried. despite these efforts, the court has only completed 18 trials in the past four years, with just a handful of convictions. in 2012, only five trials were completed and 93 percent of the cases were dismissed. our worst nightmare. on june 12, 2014, our school nurse told senior management that a student had confided to her that an important member of our team, macintosh johnson, a program coordinator and community liaison, had sexually assaulted her. once our senior team learned this horrific news, liberian police were contacted and the suspect was arrested 4 days later. his trial began in september 2015 with a case brought by the government of liberia. the courage of the first student to come forward gave 9 other girls the confidence to come forward too. after a mistrial in 2016, the defendant died in prison. actions taken to ensure safety. this incident increased our vigilance over personal safety. we want our stance to be heard loud and clear that we have a zero tolerance policy for abuse. we've since taken the following actions to ensure the safety of our students. we re - evaluated our ratio of male and female staff and have made every effort possible to hire qualified female teachers as they interact with our students the most. we continue to monitor all of our staff, regardless of gender, to ensure there is no abuse of any kind. under no circumstance are girls left alone on campus or in vehicles with males. we have a schedule that is followed and we know where every single child is at any time during the day. the schedule allows no time for students to be alone with anyone in the building except with the nurse or social worker. we revised our child protection policy and code of conduct, which all staff signed. we conduct reference checks for every staff member. we created and implemented a whistleblower protection policy. we created systems for anonymous complaints and formally documented complaints to further build a culture of trust among students and staff. we implemented sexual and reproductive health classes that include age - appropriate awareness education on assault and abuse so students can recognize inappropriate behavior. we conduct parent trainings on gender - based violence to spread awareness to families and the community. the safety of the children we serve is our number one priority. more than me has a zero tolerance policy for sexual violence and exploitation. standing with our students. we are extremely proud of our students for speaking out when rape and transactional sex are all too commonly accepted and victims are expected to stay silent. our students proved that they can stand up and advocate for themselves and that's huge. creating a culture of trust and safe space for children to share what is happening with them is a vital first step to systemic change and a step we hope more schools and communities will strive for. we refuse to stay silent. as we work to rebuild liberia's education system alongside the ministry of education, we are committed to making child protection one of the key pillars of these reforms. additional resources. mtm is committed to transparency and acting as a resource for other organizations and communities. we're compiling a list of our own resources and outside resources that have helped shape our actions along the way. if you'd like to talk to someone from our team about an issue at your school or in your community, please contact himorethanmeorg.",

        "text": "treatments: ankle fusion (arthrodesis). ankle arthrodesis (ankle fusion) is an operation to fuse or stiffen the ankle joint. it involves removing the surfaces of the damaged ankle joint and fusing the tibia to the talus bone so that your foot is under your body and flat to the floor. this procedure can be performed as keyhole surgery (also referred to as arthroscopic surgery) or open surgery. in keyhole surgery, a number of small incisions are made, whereas in open surgery, a larger incision is made. the damaged joint surfaces are removed and the bones are held together using screws to maintain the position while bone healing occurs and the bones fuse together to become one. this converts a stiff, painful joint into a stiff but pain - free one. the surgery takes between one and two hours and you will have a tourniquet applied around your thigh during the surgery to reduce bleeding. when you wake from surgery, you will have a below - knee partial cast which may later be changed into a full below - knee plaster or synthetic cast. you will have to wear a cast for up to 12 weeks. you will need crutches or a frame to help you move around during this time. depending on your situation, your surgeon will allow you to weight bear after about 6 weeks and sometimes sooner. you should discuss your postoperative care with your surgeon. because you are immobilised after surgery, it is usually recommended that you have blood - thinning medication to prevent blood clots whilst in the cast as well as a special stocking on the other leg to improve blood flow. after the plaster cast is removed, you may require an ankle brace or a walking boot for a few more weeks. you will then be able to wear your normal shoes. sometimes changes are made to the sole of the shoe to give you a normal stride length despite the stiffened joint. in some circumstances where there is major deformity or where the arthritis affects more than one joint, your surgeon may recommend fusion of more than one joint. there are lots of surgical options including a tibiotalocalcaneal fusion or a pantalar fusion. these may involve a rod or a large metal nail inserted up to the middle of the shinbone through the heel. to find out more, please visit the ankle arthritis tarva website. what can i expect after ankle arthrodesis? ankle arthrodesis provides excellent pain relief and good function and has a 90% success rate as measured by patient satisfaction in the short to medium term. some patients express concerns regarding the level of mobility they will have following surgery. ankle arthrodesis removes ankle movement completely; however, as much as 50% of the up and down movement of the foot is maintained (see page 7). walking: in most cases, walking will return towards normal so that others may not notice that you have had an ankle arthrodesis. if you walked with a limp prior to surgery because of pain, after the surgery your walking is likely to improve. because the stride length is shorter, a limp may be noticeable if you start to run. some female patients comment that it is uncomfortable or not possible to wear high - heeled shoes after ankle arthrodesis. sports: most patients with a successful ankle arthrodesis are able to walk without a limp, cycle and do certain sports such as golf. although more vigorous activities such as squash, tennis or football may be possible after an ankle arthrodesis, we do not recommend them as they put a lot of stress across the adjacent joints which will wear with time and pain may return. similarly, walking or hiking on rough ground is possible but will put more stress on the adjacent joints. you can protect the adjacent joints by wearing a sturdy above - ankle walking boot. your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video. this video shows a 42 - year - old man 1 year post arthroscopic ankle fusion. he is able to stand on his tiptoes and jog, albeit with a slight limp. are there any major risks with ankle fusion? in addition to the general risks of ankle surgery, the specific risks of ankle arthrodesis relate to problems with union and transference of stress to the adjacent joints. mal - union: research has shown that 5 to 10% of fusions do not heal in the exact position intended. this may either be due to the fact that the position was not achieved at the time of surgery or that the bones have shifted while in plaster. this does not usually cause any major problems but rarely further surgery may be required to correct this. adjacent joint arthritis: because the ankle joint has been stiffened, more pressure will be taken by adjacent joints which, with time, are at risk of wearing. signs of arthritis in the adjacent joints are common on x - rays after 10 years but many patients do not require treatment for this. need for further surgery: sometimes the screws become prominent under the skin. if this happens, they can be removed but only about 1 in 10 patients need the screws to be taken out. if screws need removing, we usually advise you to wait at least a year after surgery to give the bones time to become strong. general complications following ankle surgery: swelling: you should expect some swelling for up to one year after surgery. elevation of limb above heart level for the first two weeks helps to reduce swelling and aid wound healing. if swelling persists and you are concerned, seek medical advice. bleeding: all wounds bleed after surgery but rarely this can be excessive, causing wound problems or requiring further surgery. painful scar: any type of surgery will leave a scar. some people develop larger scars than others. occasionally this can cause pain and irritation. if you suspect you are prone to scar problems, please discuss this with your surgeon prior to surgery. infection: superficial wound infection (redness around the wound) occurs in up to 5% of cases. much rarer (less than 1%) is a deep infection where the metalwork or bone is infected. minor infections usually clear up with a course of antibiotics. more serious infections may require further surgery and involve complex and lengthy treatment. nerve injury: numbness or tingling at the surgical site is common and is usually temporary but up to 50% of patients who have an ankle replacement or open ankle fusion will get some numbness on the top of their foot. this is not usually a problem. if a key nerve is injured (up to 15% of cases), then it can cause permanent numbness and shooting pains requiring medication or further specialist input. rarely, the sympathetic nerves (also known as fight or flight nerves) react badly after the surgery and cause temperature and colour changes to the skin; this is known as complex. problems with union: occasionally in arthrodesis, bones fail to unite (fuse) and in the case of a replacement, the bones may not knit to the implant. this can happen in up to 10% of patients. if you smoke, your risk of such a complication is greatly increased. you will be advised to stop smoking before surgery. blood clots: deep vein thrombosis (dvt) is uncommon (5%) and pulmonary embolus (pe) is very rare (less than 0.5%) and occurs due to blood clots. we do everything to minimise these risks but they can occur and can be serious, causing prolonged leg swelling or chest problems. blood - thinning medication may be given to prevent blood clots whilst in a cast as well as a special stocking on the other leg to improve venous circulation. audit research: to find out more, please download a copy of a reputable patient information booklet on ankle arthritis from the royal national orthopaedic hospital nhs trust. there is a randomised controlled trial comparing ankle replacement against ankle fusion (tarva) see httpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct01518361. if you would like to find out more about this study, please contact claire thompson by email on tarvauclacuk. click here to find out about ankle replacement. recommendation: ankle fusion continues to represent the gold standard surgical treatment of end - stage ankle osteoarthritis but does carry the risk of adjacent joint arthritis. patients should be counselled regarding the benefits and risks of both ankle fusion and replacement as well as the potential for non - operative treatments. sorry, the browser you are using is not currently supported. disqus actively supports the following browsers: firefox, chrome, internet explorer 11, safari. 4 years ago: this man's walk looks very good. i have heard that gait can be badly affected by fusion but this does not look the case here. is this the typical outcome? my ankle admin 4 years ago: the amount of motion retained after ankle fusion depends on the motion in the adjacent joints prior to the surgery. if you have mobile adjacent joints then you will usually retain about 50% of the up and down motion after surgery. cj shene 11 months ago: hello, i myself have had a total of seven surgeries on my ankles, w both winding up being fused. i do walk with a gate cane for stability. my second fusion had been painful, more so then the first. i believe to the fact the first fusion did not take, had to be redone, more nerve damage was done. on top of this, a bone simulator had to be surgically inserted as the fuse was not taking growing back. 11 yrs now on my second triple surgery on pain meds muscle relaxers. issues have come about to where i will be seeing some one as walking any daily physical exercise cause quite often severe pain, weight is also a contributing factor as your ankles as they are the foundation of your whole body weight. after returning back to work being a physical laborer it took a toll on my ankle other leg to where down the road i had an accident which caused 2nd fusion. lg63 1 year ago: i've had an ankle fusion 10 days ago and accidentally stood on my foot this morning. does anyone know how important this is? i'm very worried that i may have damaged it. nicolette phillips 1 year ago: hello, i just had a ankle fusion 7 weeks ago. due from an injury 22 years ago, i had to have a plate and screws on my right side of my right ankle n 2 screws on the left side of my ankle. over the years i got arthritis which caused a lot of complications, most of you know it deteriorates the bones or cartilage. i don't know whatever. when my doc first told me i needed this, i was devastated. i said absoutely not, im 43 years old and i don't want to lose all mobilty in my ankle. i came msmonkey 1 year ago: hi, i've had approx 30 ortho surgeries for various lower leg issues, dislocations of kneecaps, dislocations of a few joints in my feet and ankles. i'm 46. last surgery was a fusion of my ankle in 2015. so far it's been great. i'd had heel realignment surgery and a subtalar fusion previously so this was just the ankle. pain has gone completely and that alone was worth the 3 - month recovery, instability of ankle gone too obviously. mobility is visually normal and by that i mean nobody notices there's much difference at all in my gait, including several ortho doctors. i've found that i've just adapted my gait pretty much without noticing. i can't run but to be fair i've not had any need to. i can't go on tiptoe like the chap in the video unless i bend my knees to retain balance. i can't walk far but that's not entirely due to the ankle fusion. if i overdo things i get shin splints which are pretty uncomfortable but soon pass. these are because the mechanics of my leg have altered post - surgery so other bones and joints now take the strains that the ankle once did. immediately post - surgery there was virtually no pain at all, nerve blockers used during the op. about two weeks post - surgery i did experience some severe nerve pain that...",

up needs which the department can not afford. the current retrieval rate of 84.6% needs to be improved upon. managing this resource is critical since non - retrieval impacts on universal coverage which aims to ensure all learners have the required textbooks per subject. the department through its training interventions capacitated all 545 public ordinary schools on managing ltsm and improving retrieval strategies in 2017. it must be stressed that retrieval is a societal issue and that parents and the community at large have a critical role to play in ensuring that all textbooks and ltsm provided to learners are returned in a good condition. our annual retrieval campaign will be strengthened and will call on all role players to advocate 100% retrieval. 100% retrieval of textbooks. the northern cape department of education (ncdoe) strives to ensure that learning and teaching takes place from day one when schools reopen in january 2016. learning and teaching support material (ltsm) is an integral and vital part of every education system and the effective management, utilisation and maintenance of this valuable resource will ensure access and support to the delivery of quality education. as the 2015 school year speedily draw to a close, the ncdoe wants to call on all role players and the community at large to join the 100% retrieval of textbooks campaign and would like to remind all learners to return textbooks for the benefit of other learners in the province. the provision of textbooks for every learner in the schooling system is one o the priorities of the government and millions of rands are spent annually on ltsm. the department has committed that every learner must have a core textbook for every subject in grade. if this resource is not protected and valued, money which otherwise could have been used for new innovative ltsm has to be used to replace books which are lying in homes not being utilised. parents are requested to honour their parental responsibility in ensuring that their children act responsibly and ensure that all textbooks loaned to their child is returned before the end of the 2015 academic year. principals of schools are required to ensure that maximum retention of textbooks is achieved. that calls for effective textbook retrieval system at every school in the province. schools are however reminded not to withhold learners' reports/results as a result of failure to retrieve textbooks even though a strong culture of returning textbooks is emphasized. this campaign is aimed at all citizens, those in and out of school. this is a societal issue. let's ensure 100% retrieval of textbooks in the northern cape. attachments: provincial policy for the provision and management of ltsm 2018, ncdoe sector management plan for the development, printing, procurement, delivery and utilisation ltsm, roles and responsibilities for procurement and delivery of ltsm, circular no. 42 of 2018, 2018 retrieval campaign, 100% retrieval of textbooks, 100% retrieval campaign poster, workbooks, delivery schedule, digital content, mind the gap, study guides",

        "text": "the concept of stochastic dominance. posted november 14, 2015 by nejc hladnik in quantitative finance. the concept of more or less risky is captured by the notion of a mean - preserving spread. i've gone ahead and test it with the concept of stochastic dominance as this combination provides better understanding of them both. all graphs and calculations can be downloaded below. last time we dealt with the risk - averseness, so it comes by no surprise that more risky assets brings less satisfaction for the same given expected payoff. this concept is intuitive, thus we can quickly compare assets with expectations vs variance framework if they have at least one common point (same mean value or same volatility). if this condition is not met, we are left in the dark. just imagine, are you able to tell me which asset is better for my risk - averse utility function? asset 1: er = 6.4, st deviation = 4.4; asset 2: er = 4.44, st deviation = 7.79. under the standard mean - variance analysis, two investments can't be ranked; second investment has greater mean but also greater variance. yet all of us would prefer investment 2. thus, state - by - state dominance is not enough for expected utility theory. postulates of expected utility theory lead to a definition of two weaker alternative concepts of dominance with wider applicability. these are of interest because they circumscribe the situations in which rankings among risky projects are preference - free or can be defined independently of the specific tradeoffs among return, risk and other characteristics of probability distributions represented by an agent's utility function. even though the math can be quite rigorous, i want to explain the concept of stochastic dominance in a hopefully understandable way. definition: first - order stochastic dominance (fsd). let \\(f_{1}\\) and \\(f_{2}\\) respectively represent the cumulative probability distribution functions of two random variables (cash payoffs) that without loss of generality assume values in the interval \\([a,b]\\). we say that \\(f_{1}\\) first - order stochastically dominates \\(f_{2}\\) (fsd) if and only if \\(f_{1}(x)\\leq f_{2}(x)\\) for all \\(x\\in[a,b]\\). since cumulative distribution function tells us the probability that certain payoff value will be smaller or least equal to that value, in order for \\(f_{1}\\) to fsd \\(f_{2}\\), \\(f_{1}\\) must be everywhere below and to the right of \\(f_{2}\\). it should intuitively be preffered. even though it can be usually interpreted from the graph, it is better seen from the control chart that shows what is happening to the differences between cumulative functions. as long as values don't change sign, we can conclude that one investment fsd the other. if sign changes than we are left in the dark and have to check for second - orded stochastic dominance for conclusion. definition: second - order stochastic dominance (ssd). let \\(g_{1}\\) and \\(g_{2}\\) be two super cumulative probability distribution functions for random payoffs in \\([a,b]\\). we say that \\(g_{1}\\) second - order stochastically dominates \\(g_{2}\\) (ssd) if and only if \\(\\int_{a}^{x}[g_{1}(t)-g_{2}(t)]dt\\geq0\\) for any \\(x\\in[a,b]\\). since cumulative distribution function tells us the probability that certain payoff value will be smaller or least equal to that value, in order for \\(g_{1}\\) to ssd \\(g_{2}\\), \\(g_{1}\\) must be everywhere below and to the right of \\(g_{2}\\). the condition states that as long the accumulated differences between cumulative distribution functions don't change sign, we are able to conclude that one investment ssd the other. this is best represented by the last graph. note that since super cumulative function is by definiton integral of cumulative function which is in fact integral of density function, the first derivative of super cumulative function will be cumulative function. we are basically just accumulating or adding up differences from the control graph as we move along the x - axis. some increments may be positive, some may be negative, but as long as accumulated differences don't change sign, we can say which investment ssd the other. simple continuous case: fsd. second investment has higher expected payoff as well as variance. but when graphing both cumulative functions, we can alredy see that since investment 2 lies below and more to the right of investment 1 on the whole interval that it fsd the first investment. intiutivelly, every given payoff on the respective interval has lower probability that it will be smaller or at least this big for investment 2. hence there is more probability left for higher payoffs on the right. ssd. because the condition for first - order stochastic dominance holds, we can see that the differences are accumulated nicely; accumulation starts with convex and then follows a concave function. all risk - averse agents will prefer the second - orded stohastically dominant assset. of course, fsd implies ssd; if for two investments 1 and 2, 1 fsd 2, then it is also true that 1 ssd 2. but the converse is not always true. mean - preserving case: fsd. i love this example. both investments have the same expected payoff but different variance. looking solely at the second graph, we arent able to conclude which investment is preffered even though we are intuitivelly aware of the correct answer. control chart confirms that the differences are first negative and later positive, so the condition doesn't hold and no investment fsd the other. first, there is a higher probability for a lower payoffs, but becase of the higher variance same happens to the higher ones on the right side of investment 2. so which investment is dominant? ssd. accumulated differences are first getting more and more negative as long as increments are negative as well. after riching a peak at the middle they change sign, so add them up and the accumulation will again go back to zero. but still the condition holds. accumulated differences never changed sign and became positive. our intuition is confirmed; investment 1 ssd investment 2. discrete case: fsd. stochastic dominance can be applicable also to other distributions, eg in this case we have 2 discrete probability distributions. is the first condition met? no. this is confirmed by the difference values between them; they change sign. ssd. is the second condition met? yes. on the observable interval, accumulation of differences never changes sign. investment 2 ssd investment 1. resources: all graphs and calculations are provided in excel file. more information on harvard's or wikipedia's post. since 15/2018, posts regarding financial simulations and distributions are protected by password. the access can be arranged for students of nova sbe upon request. all comments should be addressed in a polite manner using a full real name. thank you. categories: corporate finance (3), derivatives markets (1), interviews (1), management accounting (2), quantitative finance (13), talks and lectures (2), tools and tips (6). archives: june 2017, february 2017, august 2016, july 2016, may 2016, april 2016, march 2016, february 2016, january 2016, december 2015, november 2015. meta: entries rss, comments rss, wordpressorg",

        "text": "close inspection, sept 26, 2017. the 5 skin products i bought after falling down a reddit rabbit hole. by sara spruch - feiner. reddit - tested, me - approved. if skin is a battlefield, then members of reddit's skincare addiction sub are an army of determined warriors, unwilling to rest until the battle's been won. on the message board, products are methodically tested, analyzed, judged, and critiqued. if a user needs help pinpointing what may or may not be working, others are invited to step in. it's a team of some 321,353 amateur dermatologists. acne is never just acne, and dry skin is never just dry skin; they're closed comedones and dehydration. i've been writing about beauty for years, and while i've tried everything from $1 korean sheet masks to $600 swiss serums, reddit's unbiased, no - nonsense skincare obsessives intrigued me. so i dug deep into the sca archives, compiled some of their most - discussed favorite products (excepting your standard fare like cerave face wash and stridex pads), and tried them myself. what redditors say: \"it's the first product i've ever used that makes me feel like i'm in that scene in mulan where she just wipes her face and her makeup just slides right off.\" - peachbot what i thought: micellar waters, if you don't know them, are a french - girl beauty secret gone mainstream, used to remove makeup or for cleansing on lazy days. basically, cleansing - oil molecules (micelles) suspended in water help draw dirt and oil out of the skin without stripping skin of natural oils. in my opinion, which is shared with most dermatologists, they're best saved for in - a - pinch situations (post - workout, travel, etc.) rather than to replace your cleansing routine. this may be personal preference, but cleansing the traditional way over the sink has become something i look forward to at the end of each day. micellar water is great for your gym bag though, and garnier's is more affordable than its similarly packaged french counterpart. it's quick, easy, a little bit refreshing, and didn't irritate my skin in the slightest. if i can, i still prefer washing my face though; it just feels more thorough, but on the go, micellar water is a great solution. i'll keep one in my gym bag. garnier skinactive micellar cleansing water, $9 at ulta. what redditors say: \"will rebuy forever. it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy or unwashed, but i definitely recommend using your normal cleanser afterwards; it's a doozy.\" what i thought: anyone who's serious about skin care knows: never go to bed with your makeup on. one of reddit's favorite ways to remove it: clinique's og balm. at $30, it's pricier than drugstore cleansers, but then cleansing balms haven't even made their way to drugstores yet. compared to face wash, a balm doesn't lather and thus won't strip your skin. i like this one a lot because it's fragrance - free with a very pleasant sensory experience; you massage the balm into dry skin and watch as it melts into an oil, taking dirt and makeup with it. it's so mild it'd be a great option when my not - super - sensitive skin is feeling dry or otherwise acts up. i do have to say though that i prefer annee de mamiel's restorative cleansing balm, which comes with a breathing exercise to do while cleansing that i swear feels like a near - spiritual experience. of course, it's also more than double the price. if you've never tried a cleansing balm before though, the clinique is the way to start; sensitive skin types may just be converted. clinique take the day off cleansing balm, $30 at nordstrom. what redditors say: \"it's amazing. my skin texture improved dramatically after a few days. my pores are smaller and tighter. no more filaments around my nose. no more redness or uneven skin tone. skin feels soft, plump, and glowy.\" - pantone877 what i thought: perhaps my biggest kinship with sca members is my strong belief in chemical exfoliation, and this is the one that made me a believer. for an all - in - one approach to chemical exfoliation, this is the night serum from drunk elephant, a brand that's as close to universally beloved as it gets. to make sure the glycolic acid is safe for regular use, i spoke with new york dermatologist dr. dendy engelman. \"this serum contains glycolic acid derived from sugarcane, the smallest acid molecule, which penetrates further and effectively breaks down dead, weak skin cells,\" dr. engelman says. her only warning is that not everyone's skin can handle a chemical exfoliant every day. mine can, but as they say on reddit, ymmv (your mileage may vary), or more simply, everyone's skin is different. i've used this night serum pretty religiously for more than a year now, and the rumors are true. your skin will look better by morning. the formula contains a 12 percent blend of ahas and bhas, which resurface and decongest skin minus any potentially irritating ingredients. going the sensitive - skin route when it comes to acids is a sound decision, whether you're actually sensitive or not. if you can't tell, i absolutely love this product. it is expensive. it is worth it. drunk elephant tlc framboos glycolic night serum, $90 at sephora. the ordinary vitamin c suspension 23 + ha spheres 2. what redditors say: \"from my experience in using it a couple months, i absolutely love it, and i started to notice a difference pretty quickly. i think it took about a week for me to really notice, but my skin started to gain a lot of healthy colour and life back from its initial sallowness.\" - chromatistic what i thought: the reddit beginner skincare routine suggests a ph - balanced cleanser, chemical exfoliant, moisturizer, and spf. the ordinary's vitamin c is ph - balanced, which supposedly approximates your skin's own natural barrier; most products are too alkaline. at just $8, this often - sold - out cream contains 23 percent pure l - ascorbic acid, which remains stable thanks to a water - free formulation combined with dehydrated spheres of hyaluronic acid to help smooth skin. if you're not used to the consistency, it feels almost like a gentle facial scrub; there's some grittiness that i don't love, but the ordinary also has a smoother formulation (vitamin c suspension 30 in silicone). if you need more of a reason to be adding the antioxidant vitamin c into your routine, know that it ups your skin's natural sun protection, brightens your skin, strengthens the skin barrier, and is known to prevent signs of aging. and let me mention again: it costs $8.6 at sephora. what redditors say: \"no white cast, lightly tinted, totally matte finish, and as a bonus, this makes your skin look amazing; it has a smoothing - blurring effect that is better than any makeup.\" - crumpetsandtea543 what i thought: this is the rare mineral sunscreen with a foundation - like tint rather than the typical white cast, that's just light enough for combination - oily skin. it's a best - seller at paula's choice for that exact reason. paula's choice is a brand favorite of redditors; the company's website is just as much a skincare encyclopedia as it is a store. if you need more color - correction or coverage, you can layer foundation on top with ease. i found it to be a terrific lightweight daily option that felt hydrating, takes care of spf, and most importantly of all, doesn't clog my pores. the slight tint even works as an instant complexion perfecter. i'm so happy i discovered this that i've been keeping it in my rotation ever since. paula's choice resist super - light wrinkle defense spf 30, $33 at dermstore. the strategist is designed to surface the most useful expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast ecommerce landscape. some of our latest conquests include the best women's jeans, rolling luggage, pillows for side sleepers, ultra - flattering pants, and bath towels. we update links when possible, but note that deals can expire and all prices are subject to change. every editorial product is independently selected. if you buy something through our links, new york may earn an affiliate commission. tags: the strategist, beauty, skincare and body, face",

        "text": "in rules, real - world trading. comments, share. real - world trading (rwt), also called real - world item trading (rwit), is the act of trading anything outside of runescape, usually real - world money, for runescape items or services, or vice versa. it is an illegal activity in runescape, subjected to severe consequences. it involves paying real - world money to get gold, items, or skill levels in - game, and vice versa. legally, every item in runescape is the property of jagex and, therefore, can not be considered as personal property of the player. players who conduct rwt violate the rules and may risk being permanently banned without warning. there are two general kinds of real - world traders: personal sellers and companies. personal sellers are people who exchange virtual items and real money between friends and do it on a more casual basis, while larger groups and companies engaged in this practice via websites and on a more public and formal basis. both kinds of rwt are considered violations of the rules and are treated identically by jagex if evidence is presented or found to suggest a rwt action has occurred or is being arranged. contents show: rule breaking real - world item traders often get money and items in - game through devious means. they use bots to gold - farm money and items, exploit bugs in the game, and scam players of their items and accounts, thus making them the cause of the majority of rule - breaking in - game. because real - world trading is against runescape's rules, some players have tried to find legal loopholes, such as claiming that the real money is paid for the time spent, that the transfers of real and virtual items are independent, or even that they were selling a joke and it came with an account or money. however, jagex still says that these methods are against rules. over time, jagex has banned many players for this behaviour and has implemented some updates in - game to stop this, but it has not been without controversy. rationale for being against rwt see also macro. some mmorpgs have been known to encourage rwt and have even provided legal means to engage in trading items for real - world money. for some of these games, there are even stores that allow you to buy in - game currency or to be able to unlock special features of the game. andrew gower, one of the co - founders of jagex and the original developer who created runescape, pointed out that introducing the ability to engage in real - world item trading significantly modifies player behaviour and puts players with access to significant real - life financial resources on an unfair footing with other players, distorting many aspects of game play and changing the relationship between the company and players. as a long - time multiplayer game player himself, mr. gower saw the impact of real - world item trades and how it changed the behaviour of players who obtained these items in other games. mr. gower left the company before the main game's microtransactions, such as the squeal of fortune, treasure hunter, and solomons general store, were placed into the game. this is one rule that was established at the very beginning when runescape was still being designed and before any players even started to play this game. an example of how this distorts the game play is in particular with gold farmers or resource gatherers that work for the rwt companies. while macros or bots are sometimes used for automating boring tasks, there are sometimes employees of the rwt companies who also are playing runescape with other more normal players. however, their purpose in being in the game is not necessarily to have fun or to try different things out; they are actually getting paid to perform menial tasks like chopping logs, mining ore, or engaging in other resource gathering. some of these accounts are shared between multiple employees, so it isn't unusual for an account to be used 24 hours per day. usually, for some tasks where a player would eventually get bored with doing the same repetitive actions over and over again, the gold farmers camp out in resource gathering areas for more efficient collecting. as these are not programs but actual live people, anti - macro measures such as the random events can not prevent this. by facilitating some sort of exchange to take place between the virtual currencies and real - world currencies, it may open up legal liabilities issues for jagex and the player community for real - world taxation laws, including income taxes, violations of gambling laws in many countries or political jurisdictions, and regulatory oversight by banking institutions and the financial ministries or executive departments like the us irs over in - game content. this sort of complex government regulation is something companies like jagex often try to avoid. by not facilitating rwt or even permitting it at all, jagex is able to avoid having to report to rwt criminal behaviour. upon review of the kinds of individuals involved with rwt, and in particular the corporate entities involved with this trade, discoveries of other sorts of real - life criminal activity has also taken place by these organisations. other criminal activities also occur, including money laundering, where financial transactions from other criminal activity is included with income from rwt activities to legitimize the income and to help provide capital resources for funding other criminal enterprises. there is even a chance to get robbed. perhaps the most significant issue that jagex had to directly face was the use of stolen credit cards being used to pay for membership fees by rwt organisations. credit card information was obtained from other criminal activities and then used to help pay for the gold farmer accounts on member worlds, where after a certain period of time it would be reported that the card was stolen. when this happens, the vendor, in this case jagex, is required by the credit card agreements to refund the unauthorized spending. this issue very directly impacted jagex from a fiscal standpoint and represented a significant loss of income for jagex. according to jagex, what ultimately proved to be the final breaking point for jagex was when several of the banks that provided the credit card processing services for jagex started to charge a much higher processing fee due to the excessive number of chargebacks that were happening compared to other internet - based companies. it should be noted that jagex wasn't necessarily singled out individually, as nearly all online gaming companies have had to address this issue to one extent or another. in addition, these banks threatened to completely cut off these financial services, report jagex to various credit bureaus as a fraudulent enterprise. the removal of real - world - traders jagex's initial response on the runescape december behind the scenes 2007 article, jagex informed everyone that they would be taking extreme measures in order to finally be rid of rwt. a quote from the article: \"on a more serious note, many of you will be aware of our efforts to stop real - world trading and how some of our recent updates have been part of that. you may have questions about it. what does it mean? how does it affect the game? how big a problem is it? what are the ways of dealing with it? to answer these questions and more, we'll be releasing a very important development diary on the subject.\" jagex's actions on 10 december 2007, jagex created a development diary to explain what they've done with real - world trading. they found nearly every way possible to keep it from happening, including removing unbalanced trading and making a limit on how much people can stake in the duel arena, changing the way dropped items act, modifying the party room, and getting rid of player killing in the wilderness, which was a favourite activity of some players. to replace pking, jagex added a new an activity called bounty hunter. in this, you are assigned a single player in the arena to kill, although you are still free to attack or be attacked by anyone, albeit with some penalties. they also released clan wars, a game where you and your clan go up against another clan in a war of up to two - hundred fighters. to compensate for the loss of player - killers, jagex also added very dangerous and powerful monsters called revenants in the wilderness in order to make the wilderness dangerous even without actual players to attack you. much later, jagex also made pvp worlds where players can attack each other anywhere in the world except in some banks and guilds. players' reactions due to these updates, riots broke out all across runescape, most notably in the pay - to - pk riot at falador on world 66. there were also many smaller riots going on around, and thousands of players reportedly quit the game. there was a common misconception that players that quit the game would cost jagex money; however, the loss of tens of thousands of member rwts far outweighed the loss of a few thousand quitting players. jagex's stance jagex claimed that real - world trading had been much more devastating to runescape. not only had there been illegal trades of money for items and gold, but it caused many larger problems. jagex stated that many rwts committed credit card fraud by using stolen credit card numbers to pay for their p2p gold - farming accounts and costing jagex a large amount of money. however, normally credit card companies normally pay for any credit card fraud, so it is unclear how jagex believes this to cost them money, especially as they increase the total number of payments by doing so. it is unclear why jagex believes they would pay directly with credit cards to jagex rather than emptying bank accounts. real - world traders' reactions since the updates, most of the various real - world trading companies began requesting the customers' account password and bank pin and then farm the gold on the customers' account, similar to power - levelling, as this is one of the only options left for real - world trading. another method was transferring the items between accounts via bounty hunter; however, bounty hunter was later removed, making this no longer possible. as bounty hunter has returned, however, it currently remains a possible option. today, due to the free trade and wilderness update, most companies do not require your password for gold orders and will meet face - to - face at a certain time to transfer your gold. controversies runefest 2010 on 28 april 2010, jagex added a new option to the in - game npc diango, allowing players who had purchased a ticket for runefest 2010 to exchange a code to receive a unique in - game item, the flagstaff of festivities. those who had bought tickets for the runefest 2010 event were emailed item codes for each ticket which they had purchased. a great deal of controversy was therefore sparked on the runescape official forums as players felt that due to the requirement of purchasing a ticket to obtain the item, jagex were participating in real - world trading or microtransactions, therefore going against jagex's apparent stance on real - world trading and their initial statement of it not being in the spirit of the game. the defence jagex used was questionable, arguing that the players were not buying the flagstaff but tickets to an event, which is exactly the logic that jagex refuted when raised as a defence in certain rwt activities. exclusive item membership card promotion on 14 june 2011, jagex started a promotion in which american customers buying membership cards would also receive the exclusive in - game ornate katana. the only way to obtain the katana is by purchasing a 90 - day membership card at a gamestop location within the united states between 20 june and 10 july. people who subscribe from other countries, use other methods, buy membership cards from other stores or for different durations, or purchase membership on other days can not obtain the katana. the controversy was not just because of the selling of an in - game item, but also because the promotion is exclusive to the point that most members either could not obtain the item without great inconvenience an expense. this offer was advertised on the main page but not within an article. some people in the runescape community felt that jagex was actually performing rwt themselves in this update. runefest 2011 the runefest website was updated to announce that yet another item would be given to those who purchase tickets for...",

        "text": "php 7.0.33 released. mailparse, ezmlm_hash, php manual, function reference, mail - related extensions, mail, mail functions. change language: mail. php 4, php 5, php 7. mail - description bool mail ( string $to, string $subject, string $message, [mixed $additional_headers = null], [string $additional_parameters = null] ) sends an email. parameters: - to: receiver or receivers of the mail. the formatting of this string must comply with rfc 2822. some examples are \"<email>\", \"<email>, <email>\", \"user <<email>\", \"user <<email>, another user <<email>\". - subject: subject of the email to be sent. caution: subject must satisfy rfc 2047. - message: message to be sent. each line should be separated with a crlf ( ). lines should not be larger than 70 characters. caution: windows only. when php is talking to a smtp server directly, if a full stop is found on the start of a line, it is removed. to counteract this, replace these occurrences with a double dot (..). - additional_headers: optional. string or array to be inserted at the end of the email header. this is typically used to add extra headers (from, cc, and bcc). multiple extra headers should be separated with a crlf ( ). if outside data are used to compose this header, the data should be sanitized so that no unwanted headers could be injected. if an array is passed, its keys are the header names and its values are the respective header values. note: before php 5.4.42 and 5.5.27 respectively, additional_headers did not have mail header injection protection. therefore, users must make sure specified headers are safe and contains headers only, i.e., never start mail body by putting multiple newlines. note: when sending mail, the mail must contain a from header. this can be set with the additional_headers parameter or a default can be set in php.ini. failing to do this will result in an error message similar to \"warning: mail(): sendmail_from not set in php.ini or custom from header missing\". the from header sets also return - path under windows. - additional_parameters: optional. the additional_parameters parameter can be used to pass additional flags as command line options to the program configured to be used when sending mail as defined by the sendmail_path configuration setting. for example, this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using sendmail with the -f sendmail option. this parameter is escaped by escapeshellcmd internally to prevent command execution (escapeshellcmd prevents command execution but allows to add additional parameters). for security reasons, it is recommended for the user to sanitize this parameter to avoid adding unwanted parameters to the shell command. since escapeshellcmd is applied automatically, some characters that are allowed as email addresses by internet rfcs can not be used. mail can not allow such characters, so in programs where the use of such characters is required, alternative means of sending emails such as using a framework or a library is recommended. the user that the webserver runs as should be added as a trusted user to the sendmail configuration to prevent a \"x - warning\" header from being added to the message when the envelope sender (-f) is set using this method. for sendmail users, this file is /etc/mail/trusted - users. return values: returns true if the mail was successfully accepted for delivery, false otherwise. it is important to note that just because the mail was accepted for delivery, it does not mean the mail will actually reach the intended destination. changelog: - version 7.2.0: the additional_headers parameter now also accepts an array. - 5.4.42, 5.5.27: header injection protection has been addded for the additional_headers parameter. this means that multiple consecutive newlines are no longer allowed. - 4.2.3: the additional_parameters parameter is disabled in safe_mode and the mail function will expose a warning message and return false when used. examples: example 1: sending mail using mail to send a simple email. '''php $message = \"message line 1 line 2 line 3\"; // in case any of our lines are larger than 70 characters, we should use wordwrap $message = wordwrap($message, 70, \" \"); mail(\"<email>\", \"my subject\", $message); ''' example 2: sending mail with extra headers the addition of basic headers telling the mua the from and reply - to addresses. '''php $to = \"<email>\"; $subject = \"the subject\"; $message = \"hello\"; $headers = \"from: <email> reply - to: <email> x - mailer: php \".phpversion(); mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers); ''' example 3: sending mail with extra headers as array this example sends the same mail as the example immediately above but passes the additional headers as array (available as of php 7.2.0). '''php $to = \"<email>\"; $subject = \"the subject\"; $message = \"hello\"; $headers = array( \"from\" => \"<email>\", \"reply - to\" => \"<email>\", \"x - mailer\" => \"php \".phpversion() ); mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers); ''' example 4: sending mail with an additional command line parameter the additional_parameters parameter can be used to pass an additional parameter to the program configured to use when sending mail using the sendmail_path. '''php mail(\"<email>\", \"the subject\", \"the message\", null, \"<email>\"); ''' example 5: sending html email it is also possible to send html email with mail. '''php $to = \"<email>, <email>\"; // note the comma $subject = \"subject: birthday reminders for august\"; $message = \"<html><head><title>birthday reminders for august</title></head><body><p>here are the birthdays upcoming in august</p><table><tr><th>person</th><th>day</th><th>month</th><th>year</th></tr><tr><td>johny</td><td>10th</td><td>august</td><td>1970</td></tr><tr><td>sally</td><td>17th</td><td>august</td><td>1973</td></tr></table></body></html>\"; // to send html mail, the content - type header must be set $headers = \"mime - version: 1.0 \"; $headers.= \"content - type: text/html; charset = iso8859 - 1\"; $additional_headers = \"to: mary <<email>, kelly <<email> \"; $additional_headers.= \"from: birthday reminder <<email> \"; $additional_headers.= \"cc: <email> \"; $additional_headers.= \"bcc: <email>\"; mail($to, $subject, $message, implode(\" \", $additional_headers)); ''' note: if intending to send html or otherwise complex mails, it is recommended to use the pear package pear::mail_mime. notes: note: the windows implementation of mail differs in many ways from the unix implementation. first, it doesn't use a local binary for composing messages but only operates on direct sockets, which means a mta is needed listening on a network socket which can either on the localhost or a remote machine. second, the custom headers like from, cc, bcc and date are not interpreted by the mta in the first place but are parsed by php. as such, the to parameter should not be an address in the form of \"something <<email>\". the mail command may not parse this properly while talking with the mta. note: it is worth noting that the mail function is not suitable for larger volumes of email in a loop. this function opens and closes an smtp socket for each email, which is not very efficient. for the sending of large amounts of email, see the pear::mail and pear::mail_queue packages. note: the following rfcs may be useful: rfc 1896, rfc 2045, rfc 2046, rfc 2047, rfc 2048, rfc 2049 and rfc 2822. see also: imap_mail - send an email message. pear::mail, pear::mail_mime - add a note. user contributed notes: up down 18 anonymous 1 year ago security advice: although it is not documented for the parameters to and subject, the mail function changes at least and to space. so these parameters are safe against injection of additional headers. but you might want to check to for commas as these separate multiple addresses and you might not want to send to more than one recipient. the crucial part is the additional_headers parameter. this parameter can't be cleaned by the mail function. so it is up to you to prevent unwanted or to be inserted into the values you put in there. otherwise, you just created a potential spam distributor. up down 10 <email> 1 year ago i migrated an application to a platform without a local transport agent (mta). i did not want to configure an mta, so i wrote this xxmail function to replace mail with calls to a remote smtp server. hopefully it is of some use. '''php function xxmail($to, $subject, $body, $headers, $smtp = stream_socket_client(\"tcp:smtp.yourmail.com:25\", $eno, $estr, 30, b, 8192)) { $c = \" \"; $s = \"<email>\"; fwrite($smtp, \"helo \". _env[\"hostname\"]. $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); fwrite($smtp, \"mail from: $s\". $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); fwrite($smtp, \"rcpt to: $to\". $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); fwrite($smtp, \"data\". $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); $header = \"\"; fwrite($smtp, \"to: $to\". $c); if (strlen($subject)) { fwrite($smtp, \"subject: $subject\". $c); } if (strlen($headers)) { fwrite($smtp, $headers. \"must be delimited\". $c); } $body = \"\"; if (strlen($body)) { fwrite($smtp, $body. $c); } fwrite($smtp, \".\". $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); close($smtp); fwrite($smtp, \"quit\". $c. \"junk\"); fgets($smtp, b); fclose($smtp); } ''' up down 8 <email> 1 year ago the sendmail executable which php uses on linux/mac (not windows) expects as a line separator. this executable is a standard and emulated by other mtas. is confirmed required for qmail and postfix, probably also for sendmail and exim, but i have not tested. if you pass through using as a separator, it may appear to work, but your email will be subtly corrupted and some middleware may break. it only works because some systems will clean up your mistake. if you are implementing dkim, be very careful as dkim checks will fail at least on popular validation tools if you screw this up. dkim must be calculated using , but then you must switch it all to when using the php mail function. on windows, however, you should use because php is using smtp in this situation and hence the normal rules of the smtp protocol, not the normal rules of unix piping, apply. up down 5 <email> 1 year ago often it's helpful to find the exact error message that is triggered by the mail function. while the function doesn't provide an error directly, you can use error_get_last when mail returns false. '''php $success = mail(\"<email>\", \"my subject\", \"message\"); if (!$success) { $errormessage = error_get_last(); echo \"message: \". $errormessage; } ''' tested successfully on windows which uses smtp by default, but sendmail on linux/osx may not provide the same level of detail. thanks to <url> up down 3 abomb 6 years ago i was having delivery issues from this function to gmail, yahoo, aol etc. i used the notes here to figure that you need to be setting your return - path to a valid email to catch bounces. there are two extra delivery gotchas on top of that: 1. the domain in the email used in the -f option in the php.ini sendmail parameter or in the mail extra parameters field needs to have a valid spf record for the domain in dns as a txt record type for sure and add an additional spf type record if possible. why? that's header field being used for spam checks. 2. you should also use a domain key or dkim. the trick here is that the domain key/dkim is case sensitive. i used cpanel to create my domain key which automatically used all lowercase domain names in the key creation. i found when sending email and using a camel case -f accountmydomainherecom option my key was not accepted. however, it was accepted when i used -f accountmydomainherecom. there are many other factors that can contribute to mail not getting to inboxes including your own multiple failed testing attempts, so i suggest you consult each sites guidelines and don't ask me for help. these are just the couple technical issues that helped my case. i hope this saves someone some time and headaches. up down 2 eeeugeneee 1 year ago send mail with minimal requirements from email services. '''php $encoding = \"utf8\"; $preferences = array( \"input - charset\" => $encoding, \"output - charset\" => $encoding, \"linelength\" => 76, \"linebreakchars\" => \" \" ); $mail_header = \"content - type: text/html; charset = \". $encoding. \" \"; $mail_header.= \"from: from_name <from_mail> \"; $mail_header.= \"mime - version: 1.0 \"; $mail_header.= \"content - transfer - encoding: 8bit \"; $mail_header.= \"date: \". date(\"r t\"). \" \"; $mail_header.= iconv_mime_encode(\"subject\", \"mail_subject\", $preferences); mail(\"mail_to\", \"mail_subject\", \"mail_message\", $mail_header); ''' up down 3 pavellint@vkcom 6 years ago here's a small handy function i use to send email in utf8. '''php function mail_utf8($to, $from_user, $from_email, $subject = \"no subject\", $message = \"\") { $from_user = \"utf8b\". base64_encode($from_user); $subject = \"utf8b\". base64_encode($subject); $headers = \"from: $from_user <$from_email> \"; $headers.= \"mime - version: 1.0 \"; $headers.= \"content - type: text/html; charset = utf8 \"; return mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers); } ''' up down 3 porjo 8 years ago make sure you enclose in double quotes, not single quotes.",

        "text": "in artificial consciousness: phenomenal and access conciousness. contents show: ned block (1955). ned block is in the nyu department of philosophy. two types of consciousness: according to block, phenomenal consciousness is experience. the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state. the mark of access - consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action. block feels that it is possible to have phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness independently of each other, but in general they do interact. there is no generally agreed - upon way of categorizing different types of consciousness. block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness tries to distinguish between conscious states that either do or do not directly involve the control of thought and action. phenomenal consciousness: according to block, phenomenal consciousness results from sensory experiences such as hearing, smelling, tasting, and having pains. block groups together as phenomenal consciousness the experiences of sensations, feelings, perceptions, thoughts, wants, and emotions. block excludes from phenomenal consciousness anything having to do with cognition, intentionality, or with properties definable in a computer program. access consciousness: access consciousness is available for use in reasoning and for direct conscious control of action and speech. for block, the reportability of access consciousness is of great practical importance. according to block, reportability is often the best practical guide to a - consciousness. note: block often uses the terms p - consciousness and a - consciousness to refer to phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. also, access consciousness must be representational because only representational content can figure in reasoning. examples of access consciousness are thoughts, beliefs, and desires. a potential source of confusion is that some phenomenal consciousness is also representational. the key distinction to keep in mind about representational content that block would place in the access consciousness category is that the reason it is placed in the access consciousness category is because of its representational aspect. elements of phenomenal consciousness are assigned to the phenomenal consciousness category because of their phenomenal content. reaction: an immediate point of controversy for block's attempt to divide consciousness into the subdivisions of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is that many people view the mind as resulting in its entirety from fundamentally computational processes. this computational view of mind implies that all of consciousness is definable in a computer program, so block's attempt to describe some consciousness as phenomenal consciousness can not succeed in identifying a distinct category of conscious states. as mentioned above, block feels that phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness normally interact, but it is possible to have access consciousness without phenomenal consciousness. in particular, block believes that zombies are possible and a robot could exist that is computationally identical to a person while having no phenomenal consciousness. similarly, block feels that you can have an animal with phenomenal consciousness but no access consciousness. block believes that we can have conscious experiences that are not possible to produce by any type of computational algorithm and that the source of such experiences is the hard problem of consciousness. block's position with respect to consciousness is analogous to that of vitalists who defined life as being in a category distinct from all possible physical processes. biologists refute vitalism by describing the physical processes that account for life. in order to refute block's claim about the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness, it is up to biologists and artificial consciousness researchers to describe computational algorithms that. why are some neurobiologists and computer scientists sure that block's dualist division of consciousness is wrong? what is the source of block's certainty that there are non - computational forms of consciousness? one example of phenomenal consciousness discussed by block is a loud noise that you do not consciously notice because you are paying attention to something else. block is sure that you were aware of the noise (phenomenal consciousness) but just not consciously aware (access consciousness). many scientists would say that in this case you were not consciously aware of the noise, but it is almost certain that portions of your. block stresses that he makes use of introspection to distinguish between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. presumably this means that when the loud noise was not noticed, it was not accessed by introspection. block has thus defined a category of consciousness that is outside of our conscious awareness (although he says we are aware of it in some other way) and not accessed by introspection. maybe it is this inaccessibility of some cases of phenomenal consciousness that motivate block's idea that such forms of consciousness can not be computational. when experiences are accessible to introspection and available for inclusion in. forms of phenomenal consciousness that are open to introspection: in his 1995 article, block went on to discuss the more interesting cases such as if, upon starting to pay attention to the load noise (see above) that was previously ignored, the experiencer noticed that there had been some earlier experience of the noise, just not of the type that we pay attention to, a type of experience that had been just on the edge of access consciousness. in ned block's entry for consciousness in the 2004 oxford companion to the mind 2, he discusses another example that he feels distinguishes between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness. as described by block, liss 3 performed an experiment in which he presented test subjects with visual stimuli (views of 4 letters). the 4 letters were shown to the test subjects in two different ways: 1. long stimulus (e.g. 40 msec) followed by a second visual stumulus (a mask known to make the first stimulus (the letters) hard to identify); or 2. short (e.g. 9 msec) without a second stimulus (the mask). subjects could identify 3 of the 4 letters on average in the short case but said they were weak and fuzzy. in the long case they could identify only one letter but said they could see them all and that the letters were sharper, brighter, and higher in contrast. this experiment suggests a double dissociation: the short stimuli were phenomenally poor but perceptually and conceptually ok, whereas the long stimuli were phenomenally sharp but perceptually or conceptually poor as reflected in the low reportability. this experiment demonstrates a distinction between (i) reportability of names of the letters and (ii) perceptual sharpness of the image. block's definitions of these two types of consciousness leads us to the conclusion that a non - computational process can present us with phenomenal consciousness of the forms of the letters, while we can imagine an additional computational algorithm for extracting the names of the letters from their form (this is why computer programs can perform character recognition). the ability of a computer to perform character recognition does not imply that it has phenomenal consciousness or that it need share our ability to be consciously aware of the forms of letters that it can algorithmically match to their names. reactions: if block's distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is correct, then it has important implications for attempts by neuroscientists to identify the neural correlates of consciousness and for attempts by computer scientists to produce artificial consciousness in man - made devices such as robots. in particular, block seems to suggest that non - computational mechanisms for producing the subjective experiences of phenomenal consciousness must be found in order to account for the richness of human consciousness or for there to be a way to rationally endow man - made machines with a similarly rich scope of personal experiences of what it is like to be in conscious states. other philosophers of consciousness such as john searle have similarly suggested that there is something fundamental about subjective experience that can not be captured by conventional computer programs. many advocates of the idea that there is a fundamentally computational basis of mind feel that the phenomenal aspects of consciousness do not lie outside of the bounds of what can be accomplished by computation 4. some of the conflict over the importance of the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness centers on just what is meant by terms such as computation, program, and algorithm. in practical terms, how can we know if it is within the power of computation, program, or algorithm to produce human - like consciousness? there is a problem of verification: can we ever really know if we have a correct biological account of the mechanistic basis of conscious experience and how can we ever know if a robot has phenomenal consciousness? many neurobiologists and computer scientists feel that philosophers such as block and searle are overly - pessimistic about the power of computation, program, or algorithm to produce human - like consciousness. the study of computation, program, algorithm, and consciousness is too primitive for us to be able to trust our intuitions about exactly what is possible for computational algorithms to accomplish. further, it may not matter what we call physical processes that can generate consciousness as long as we can figure out what they are and how to work with them. thus, neurobiologists and computer scientists feel justified in continuing to search for the. some philosophers such as thomas nagel have claimed a fundamental distinction between the first - person experience of consciousness and any third - person account of the mechanisms by which consciousness is generated 5. if philosophers can be overly - pessimistic about what neuroscientists and computer scientists can accomplish from the third - person perspective, they might also be overly - enthusiastic about the reliability of first - person introspection. some philosophers have been fundamentally skeptical about our ability to be certain about anything we observe from the first - person perspective 6. despite any sense we me have about our inability to be be wrong about our subjective evaluations of our own consciousness, it may be wise to keep an open mind and remain open to the possibility that phenomenal consciousness is not a distinct category from access consciousness. for example, they may be at the two ends of a continuous spectrum of consciousness for which some forms of consciousness are easier to imagine as being algorithmically generated that others. the results of the experiment of liss discussed above can have several interpretations. viewing printed letters can lead to activation of many different brain regions and brain processes. some parts of the brain that are devoted just to visual processing make heavy contributions to our ability to form a clear mental image of the shape, form, and color of letters. these brain regions allow us to become aware of visual features but we are almost totally unable to have any introspective insight into how we become aware of shape, form, and color. other parts of the brain are required for. most philosophers participate in introspective efforts to understand the steps involved in their own linguistic competencies. introspection can allow us to be aware of mental processes that seem to have a linear sequence for the production of speech or lines of reasoning. computer science also has an established history of defining explicit algorithms by which strings of words can be placed in grammatically correct orders and various theorem - generating programs now exist which seem to replicate some aspects of reasoning. thus, introspection combined with knowledge of what computer science has and has not yet accomplished provides philosophers with certain intuitions 7 about the nature of consciousness and the nature of computation. in particular, block has been led to suspect that phenomenal consciousness is fundamentally outside of the range of things that can be done with programs. block, n.

term romantic partnership). it is important to note that both types of relationships have their advantages and disadvantages. no relationship is better than the other. what really matters is what type of relationship is best for you. if you are wondering if there really is a difference between casual dating and a committed relationship, you have come to the right place. this blog will help you determine if you are ready to take the next step in your relationship. seriousness of the relationship. in order to be in a committed relationship, both you and your partner need to agree to be serious with one another. in other words, you need to invest your time, energy, love, support, and affection towards your partner. when you enter into a serious, committed relationship, your main goal is to develop a strong foundation that will last throughout time. a committed couple trusts, respects, loves, supports, values, and uplifts one another. this couple communicates and sees each other on a regular basis. they are also heavily involved in each other's lives. for instance, a couple in a serious relationship knows each other's friends, relatives, preferences, hang - out locations, likes and dislikes, work location, hobbies, etc. even if they have never met their partner's friends and/or family, they still feel like they know them due to hearing stories about them. it is also not uncommon to have met each other's parents and/or loved ones. this couple may be working towards a future together (i.e., engagement, marriage, and a family). on the other hand, a couple who is casually dating may not have as many expectations (i.e., long - term partnership, engagement, marriage, and/or a...). in a casual dating situation, you may or may not communicate and/or see each other on a daily or weekly basis. in fact, you may only see each other occasionally. in addition, you may not have met each other's family and/or friends. moreover, the relationship may consist purely of sex. it is also important to note that there may be feelings of detachment, although you may be really good friends. furthermore, it is not uncommon to start off casually dating only to find out that you have more in common then you originally thought. in these situations, casual dating often... monogamy vs causal dating. one of the main differences between a serious, committed relationship and causal dating is that individuals in a committed relationship tend to be monogamous. in other words, you do not date other people. in a casual dating relationship, you are not required to be monogamous. in fact, you can date multiple people if you so choose, or you can just date each other. it is important to note that casual dating can lead to unfulfilled romantic feelings. it can also lower your self -
