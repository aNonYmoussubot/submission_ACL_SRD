everyone almost sun <phone> 823pm for nearly a year healthcare wonks like myself david anderson andrew sprung and louise norris have been heavily getting the word out to promote not just the silver loading csrload workaround but an even more clever variant which ive coined the silver switcharoo which takes the concept of silver loading and goes one step further it gets a bit complicated but heres my explainer of how the silver switcharoo works for aca individual market policies the bottom line is that in theoryon paper just about everyone either comes out ahead or at least is no worse off if they use silver switching subsidized enrollees in silver plans end up paying the same as they did before subsidized enrollees in bronze plans end up paying far less and in some cases nothing at all in premiums subsidized enrollees in gold or platinum plans end up paying far less in premiums and in some cases less than they would for silver plans unsubsidized enrollees in bronze gold or platinum plans end up paying only whatever the normal premium increase is that is without any csr load on or off exchange unsubsidized enrollees in silver plans can also avoid paying any csr load by moving to an offexchange silver plan everyone wins or at least no one loses right well as norris reminds everyone theres one exception to this winwin situation but theres a downside that has to be considered as described above you cant switch from an offexchange plan to an onexchange plan in the middle of the year unless you have a qualifying event and a change in income is not a qualifying event so if youre in a state that allows the silver switch option and your income is too high for premium subsidies you can sign up for a lowercost offexchange silver plan during open enrollment but if your income drops during the year to a subsidyeligible level you wont be able to switch to an onexchange plan at that point youd essentially be stuck with your fullprice offexchange plan until the end of the year so its a gamble do you pay a higher rate for the onexchange silver plan just in case you do end up being eligible for subsidies you can go back and claim them on your tax return if your income for the year makes you eligible but only if you bought the plan through the exchange or you do take the silver switch option and go for the lowerpriced offexchange silver plan knowing that theres no way to get subsidies later in the year even if your income declines theres no right answer to this question but its something to keep in mind when youre deciding where to buy your coverage its worth noting that a potential solution would be to buy an onexchange bronze or gold plan in this situation instead of a silver plan you wouldnt have the cost of csr added to your premiums but youd also be able to start getting premium subsidies midyear if your income were to decline or go back and claim the subsidy on your tax return after the year is over as ive noted many times before my own family could be faced with this situation in 2018 andor 2019 depending on how the year goes were both selfemployed and our income is highly variable from year to year we might only make 300 of the federal poverty line one year but 500 the next or vice versa since the acas subsidy cutoff point is 400 fpl that presented an annual dilemma for us even before the csr cutoff and silver loadingswitching became a thing heres the problem 100 fpl for one person is 12140 this year 400 of that is 48560 lets say youre a single adult without kids just over that thresholdaround 50000year you earn just barely too much to qualify for aca tax credits so you have to pay full price for you policy regardless of metal level and whether you buy on or off exchange in this case assuming youre 48 years old living here in oakland county michigan a silver plan will cost around 425month 5100year or 102 of your income if youre absolutely certain that youre going to earn at least 50kyear next year as well then it doesnt matter whether you buy on or off the exchange since you wouldnt be eligible for subsides regardless however what if you have a variable income lets say theres a chance youll have a bad year and will only earn say 45000 370 fpl if that happens you will qualify for subsidies in that case youd likely qualify for 66month in tax credits 792year so youd only end up paying a total of 4308 for the year 96 of your income but heres the catch youd only qualify for that 792 if you had enrolled in the onexchange silver plan if you enrolled in the exact same policy or any other one off exchange you wouldnt qualify for any subsidies no matter how crappy your income ends up being for the year in question this by the way is likely the main reason why around 15 of onexchange enrollees are consistently unsubsidized each yeartheres a chunk of mostly selfemployed people like my wife and i who probably dont qualify for subsidies but enroll through the aca exchange anyway just in case they have a bad year and end up qualifying after all with silver loading the stakes are even higher because the gap between a subsidized and unsubsidized silver plan is even greater as norris notes it can be tricky for folks in this situation to know what the best route to take is again if youre certain that youll earn over 400 fpl in 2019 go for the offexchange plan if you think theres a reasonable chance of falling below the 400 threshold however you might want to go for an onexchange gold or bronze plan insteadjust in case update its important to note that folks caught in this situation may have another option available to them there are several money management strategies they can use to try and keep their official magi income below the 400 fpl threshold andrew sprung of xpostfactoid along with norris lays out some of them here many but not all resources for reducing magi are available only to the selfemployed they include the following 1 individual 401k ms cornwell the article reports made 80000 a year as a project manager for a small consulting firm that doesnt offer health insurance my immediate reaction was that an employee of a consultancy that doesnt offer health insurance or it emerges later a 401k should be able to get herself paid as a contractor ie get selfemployed status if she did shed be able to deduct as much income as she forfeited or more if she so chose 2 health savings account hsas are taxsheltered savings accounts that must be paired with a socalled high deductible health plans hdhp an hdhp must have a minimum deductible of 1300 for an individual and 2600 for a family rather quaint thresholds at a time when the average silver plan has a deductible approaching 4000 and the average gold plan deductible is over 1000 3 roth ira or nonretirement savings this one is for the relatively affluent lets say youre in your early 60s like ms cornwell and you want to retire early without taking early social security or drawing on your main retirement income source say a 401k withdrawals from a roth ira are not taxable income in roth iras contributions are not tax deductible when made but withdrawals after age 59 12 can be made tax free 4 selfemployed health insurance deduction if youre selfemployed and buying insurance for yourself andor your family on the individual market you can deduct the full cost of the insurance as long as your selfemployment income exceeds the cost of insurance after various other deductionsthis too is an abovetheline deduction that reduces magi 5 qualified business expenses if youre selfemployed and fill out a schedule c profit or loss from business consider being more liberal in spending to grow your business or improve your capabilities than you might normally be inclined to be it may do your business good note norris points out to me that things get a little circular when the deduction increases the subsidy thereby reducing the cost of insurance and reducingthe deduction louise points to the appropriate irs instructions for squaring this circle here charles gabas blog silver switcharoo silver loading oe6 csrs",

    "text": "opinion xinhua news agency landov the enduring influence of the crusades how muslim extremists and american conservatives came to find comfort in crusade metaphors july 15 2014 600am et by nick danforth nicholasdanfort on july 15 1099 915 years ago to the day jerusalem fell to the knights of the first crusade launching a powerful metaphor for the apparently implacable civilizational conflict between islam and christianity the abbreviated version of the story goes something like this a western army invades a middle eastern country relying on military technology to shock and awe a numerically superior muslim opponent after achieving a seemingly decisive victory the triumphant invaders set out to build a new state based on the prevailing european political model the parallel is crude and reductive yet remains popular with both muslim extremists and american conservatives alike so instead of rehashing an old narrative 915 years after it happened lets consider the odd story of how the crusades in all their messy historical detail became a lasting symbol for muslimchristian relations rather than look for overly precise political parallels in the 11th 19th and 21st centuries we should consider how selectively and effectively the language of holy war has been invoked throughout history often to the mutual benefit of opposite sides in the same conflict the way we talk about the crusades tells us a lot more about the world we live in than the crusades themselves could crusade nostalgia for the better part of a millennium after they ended no one in either western europe or the middle east cared much about the crusades the christian world was more wrapped up in its greek and roman past and when muslim thinkers considered foreign invaders they were more likely to remember the trauma of the mongols things started to change with the rise of european nationalism in the 19th century when patriotic historians rediscovered the crusades as heroic examples of french british or german chivalry and martial valor this fascination famously flourished in world war i when medieval legend offered the most enthusiastic participants in the crusades started out as dirtencrusted freeloaders with an enthusiasm for sacking the temples they claimed to protect europes interest in its crusader history peaked right around the time of its colonial exploits in the middle east that was hardly a coincidence when te lawrence of arabia fame first went to the middle east at 17 he got a camel an arab guide and a gun and set about researching his senior thesis at oxford his subject naturally was the architecture of crusader castles and as europeans wrapped their imperial mission in crusades rhetoric colonized people were quick to pick up on it if europeans cast themselves as christian knights finishing the crusaders work it is little surprise their opponents would start to identify with saladin the muslim commander who famously recaptured jerusalem then as now the crusades served as an excellent metaphor for enemies to better articulate their enmity after world war i crusaderthemed nationalism proved particularly popular with europes fascist right which is part of the reason that it lost its luster in the west but among those who still found themselves subject to western power for the rest of the 20th century crusades rhetoric remained popular especially when it became associated with israel there is a particularly sad irony though in the contemporary pairing of zionists and crusaders the crusades as many people know were an unmitigated disaster for jews vicious pogroms accompanied the crusaders progress through europe and the middle east but there is also irony europes interest in its crusader history peaked right around the time of its colonial

crusades as many people know were an unmitigated disaster for jews vicious pogroms accompanied the crusaders progress through europe and the middle east alike but there is greater ironies an even greater irony goes back a thousand years to the crusades themselves the main protagonists on both sides of this archetypal religious war were barbarians from the edges of the christian and muslim worlds respectively who belatedly embraced their faiths with excessive zeal in order to fit into the civilizations they had only recently conquered seen as a conflict between seljuqs and normans rather than muslims and christians the crusades become a much more versatile parable for our era the normans a medieval civilization now known mostly to scalemodel wargame enthusiasts owe their relative anonymity to the fact that despite their historical importance no presentday nation has quite claimed them as ancestors the swedes have the vikings and the irish have the celtics but no one has a sports franchise named after the normans the normans were more or less vikings who settled in northern france normandy in the 10th century learned french and converted to christianity before conquering england ireland and sicily then setting off for the middle east as a result theyre too scandinavian for the french too french for the scandinavians and way too french for the english but their conquests explain a good deal about the modern world why southern italians are catholic and not muslim or greek orthodox why lazy englishspeaking high school students prefer french to german german is linguistically more closely related but a huge number of french words entered our language with the norman conquest and why fitzgerald is an irish name its a corruption of the french fils or son of gerald signifying descent from one of the islands first anglonorman conquerors the normans also helped inspire many of our modern images of the middle ages giving us much of the medieval pastiche that show up in places like game of thrones that said names from the norman era were often even better than the imitations they inspired just a few harold harefoot harthacnut swein forkbeard charles the simple hrolf known as rollo william longsword william of the iron arm flodoard dudo of st quentin the dux pyratorum or duke of pirates and robert the weasel terror of the world selfpromotional piety as some of these names suggest for all the cliches about chivalry the normans image among contemporaries often had more to do with their viking ancestry than their religiosity in the words of one abbot they were men more apt to destroy than to build the temples of the lord the abovementioned robert as the most prominent norman leader in italy was excommunicated three times it is telling that one of his most pious moments occurred when after crushing the popes army in battle he kissed the pontiffs feet and begged forgiveness for the victory though not a cliche they on the other side of the crusades were the seljuqs a dynasty that entered the islamic world as mounted warriors who rode in from the central asian steppes in 1055 a decade before the norman conquest of england they seized control of baghdad becoming rulers of the abbassid caliphate and the greater middle east about half a century before the crusaders headed for jerusalem like the normans they did not always enjoy the best of reputations among their coreligionists consider the words of caliphal envoy ahmad ibn fadlan he included among the seljuqs vices the shamelessness of their women who were always unveiled and their brazenly exposing their pudenda their as it happened the normans and the seljuqs were both eager to compensate for their lack of pious credentials which helps explain how they ended up as protagonists in an epic religious war for the normans accepting christianity nominally at first was a stipulation for their being allowed to settle in northern france subsequently patronizing churches and monasteries became a crucial method to gain acceptance as a respectable part of their new society likewise when the seljuqs found themselves trying to rule the abbassid caliphate without any claim whatsoever to descent from the prophet muhammad they reinvented themselves as defenders some of the warriors who fought in the crusades were undoubtedly simple hypocrites while others were almost certainly completely convinced by their own religious rhetoric but in either case exploiting the rhetorical possibilities of a holy war fit nicely with each sides tradition of selfpromotional piety so if we insist on making the crusades in all their strange messy historical complexity a simplistic lesson about anything it might as well be for that truism that the most enthusiastic participants in any mission often started out as dirtencrusted freeloaders with an enthusiasm for sacking the temples they claimed to protect like all historical metaphors its hardly perfect but given whats going on across the middle east right now its not entirely inaccurate either nick danforth is a phd candidate at georgetown university he writes about middle east maps history

couples throughout the united states the diagnosis of infertility is usually given to couples who have been attempting to conceive for at least 1 year without success find a infertility specialist in your area conception and pregnancy are complicated processes that depend upon a number of factors including the production of healthy sperm by the man healthy eggs produced by the woman unblocked fallopian tubes that allow the sperm to reach the egg the sperms ability to fertilize the egg when they meet the ability of the fertilized egg embryo to become implanted in the womans uterus sufficient embryo quality finally for the pregnancy to progress to full term the embryo must be healthy and the womans hormonal environment adequate for its development if just one of these factors is impaired infertility can be the result is infertility primarily a womans problem it is a common assumption that infertility is primarily related to the woman in reality only onethird of infertility cases are related to the woman alone statistically onethird of infertility problems are related to men and the remaining onethird is a combination of fertility factors involving both partners or unknown causes unknown causes account for approximately twenty percent of infertility cases what causes infertility in men the most common causes of male infertility are azoospermia no sperm cells are produced and oligospermia few sperm cells are produced sometimes sperm cells are malformed or they die before they can reach the egg in rare cases infertility in men is caused by a genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis or a chromosomal abnormality for men with low sperm count or motility issues clinically proven supplements are available that can improve sperm parameters spermcheck is a corporate sponsor of the american pregnancy association and they provide an athome semen analysis you can learn more here to help with your semen quality you may shop male supplements what causes infertility in women the most common cause of female infertility is ovulation disorders problems with ovulation affect about 25 of all infertility situations other causes of female infertility include blocked fallopian tubes which can happen when a woman has had pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis congenital anomalies birth defects involving the structure of the uterus and uterine fibroids which are associated with repeated miscarriages and aging since the ability for ovaries to produce eggs tends to decline with age especially after the age of 35 shop fertility supplements for her when should someone get tested for infertility the american society of reproductive medicine recommends that women under 35 begin testing after trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 12 months the recommendation for women over 35 is to begin testing after trying to conceive unsuccessfully for 6 months some couples or individuals find that they are more relaxed when trying to conceive if they believe that everything is normal how early can you get tested couples may request that their health care provider conduct an exam to determine if everything is healthy and working correctly it is also possible to use overthecounter screening tests using testing kits to evaluate key aspects of fertility for both men and women how is infertility diagnosed as already noted couples are generally advised to seek medical help if they are unable to achieve pregnancy after a year of unprotected intercourse the doctor will conduct a physical examination of both partners to determine their general state of health and to search for physical disorders that may be contributing to infertility the doctor will usually interview both partners about their sexual habits in order to determine whether intercourse is taking place properly for conception if no cause can be determined at this point more specific tests may be recommended for women these include an analysis of body temperature and ovulation xray of the fallopian tubes and uterus and laparoscopy for men initial tests focus on semen analysis how is infertility treated approximately 8590 of infertility cases are treated with conventional therapies such as drug treatment or surgical repair of reproductive organs assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization account for the remaining infertility treatment options some people find it helpful to hear about the experiences of other infertile couples and to communicate with them the pregnancy forums of apa or shared journey are sites where you can read and share stories what is in vitro fertilization ivf in cases of blocked or absent fallopian tubes or low sperm count in vitro fertilization ivf offers couples the opportunity of biological parenthood during ivf eggs are surgically removed from the ovary and mixed with sperm outside the body in a petri dish after about 40 hours the eggs are examined to see if they have become fertilized by the sperm and are dividing into cells these fertilized eggs embryos are then placed in the womens uterus bypassing the fallopian tubes ivf has received a great deal of media attention since it was first introduced in 1978 and currently accounts for less than five percent of all infertility treatments in the united states is in vitro fertilization expensive the average cost of an ivf cycle in the united states is 12400 like other extremely delicate medical procedures ivf involves highly trained professionals with sophisticated laboratories and equipment and the cycle might need to be repeated in order to be successful while ivf and other assisted reproductive technologies are can be costly they account for only threehundredths of one percent 003 of us health care costs does in vitro fertilization work ivf was introduced in the united states in 1981 according to society of assisted reproductive technology sart who tracks art success rates in the us ivf currently accounts for more than 99 of art procedures with gift zift and combination procedures making up the remainder the average live birth rate for ivf in 2008 was 34 of all cycles the results are slightly better than the 20 chance that a reproductively healthy couple has of achieving a pregnancy in a given month and carrying it to term do insurance plans cover infertility treatment the services covered by

and treatment those states are arkansas california connecticut hawaii illinois louisiana maryland massachusetts montana new jersey new york ohio rhode island texas and west virginia however the

deluxe rooms are a time capsule october 27 2012 by roger vincent los angeles times developer nick hadim stands inside a storage area next to the alexandria jay l clendenin los angeles real estate developer nick hadim made a risky climb through an upstairs window of an abandoned building to see what he and his investors had gotten themselves into downtowns alexandria hotel had long been rumored to be haunted but instead of ghosts he found a time capsule there in a sealedoff wing of the otherwise bustling complex he encountered a dusty suite deserted in some haste in the 1930s a crumbling bowler hat lay next to a torn armchair an antique typewriter sat ready for use on the side of a wooden desk in the bathroom was a castiron clawfoot tub last filled with water during the great depression photos alexandria hotel its freaky said hadim a culver city entrepreneur with experience renovating old downtown buildings hadim plans to spend 3 million turning the alexandrias abandoned wing into small apartments which he hopes to rent at premium rates in what he will call the chelsea building what his investors bought were centuryold deluxe hotel rooms once part of the alexandria a stalwart presence at 5th and spring streets since the early 1900s now a lowpriced apartment complex hadims group purchased just a small slice of the old hotel building a wing that was sealed shut on all seven floors in a fit of pique in 1938 and has been seen by few eyes since then except those of wandering birds and the occasional vandal what most of the 35 rooms hold is a mystery because the corridors lack an entrance other than the hallways of the alexandria which have been walled off for nearly 75 years the lowest of the buildings six hotel room floors can be accessed from an adjacent roof and has been stripped by scavengers still its tall wide windows high ceilings and dark wood floors retain their grandeur even as pigeons flit in and out of the broken windows the abandoned rooms were part of what was widely considered the citys premier inn of the early 20th century according to los angeles times archives young aristocrat winston churchill stayed at the showplace as did opera star enrico caruso and presidents taft wilson and theodore roosevelt but the city moved on the 500room alexandria was eclipsed in status by the elegant los angeles biltmore hotel in 1923 the wing became unreachable because the hotels owner sealed the halls leading to it with bricks and mortar as a punishment said lee roddie daughter of the wings builder roddie explained her familys tale of woe to the times in 1967 when the elderly woman was still paying property taxes on her mostly inaccessible building as the alexandria was being built in 1905 roddies father william chick tore down his livery stable next door at 218 w 5th st and went into business with the hotels developers chick constructed an addition to the hotel on his property that was a seamless extension of the alexandria fully accessible from the hotels corridors photos alexandria hotel stairs or an elevator were an unnecessary expense he reasoned and would have eliminated some moneymaking guest rooms father made a terrible mistake roddie said looking back on that decision the hammer fell in the depression hard times forced the alexandria to close in 1934 three years later movie producer phil goldstone bought the hotel and reopened it in 1938 to the delight of roddie who was by then sole owner of the wing but their relationship quickly soured one of the tenants in the main part of the hotel moved into one of the two stores on the bottom floor of my wing because mr goldstone raised his rent roddie told the times it made mr goldstone mad he said he didnt need my wing he sealed off the corridors to my rooms on each floor making access impossible its been that way ever since tall tales used to circulate about the haunted hotel she said one of the most common was that the owners husband was killed on the titanic and the widow kept it closed in his memory my husband died of flu during world war i roddie said roddie and subsequent owners were able to rent out only the buildings groundfloor retail space which has a narrow concrete stairway in back leading to a sealedoff portion of the alexandrias former mezzanine now used for storage the oncegrand mezzanine still has elaborate gilded crown molding and rounded windows adorned with advertising in gold leaf a tall wooden ladder leads to a hatch in the roof from there the lowest level of the buildings longlost hotel can be entered through one rooms window a short hallway bisects the floor and the transom windows of some rooms remain open as they would have been in the days before air conditioning the decayed wallpaper looks like peeling paint the hardwood floors are speckled with pigeon guano but remain firm and may be restored with simple sanding hadim said 1 2 more seizure led to flojos death his 104 scores make his case

    "text": "all collections finishing processes smoothing fdm parts smoothing fdm parts as processes and materials have advanced industry has expanded the use of the technology beyond prototyping to manufacturing written by john cordes updated over a week ago overview the range of additive fabrication applications is extensive and growing as processes and materials have advanced industry has expanded the use of the technology beyond prototyping to manufacturing although the applications are diverse there is one dilemma they all share an underlying tradeoff between aesthetic quality and functionality the additive fabrication technologies with the best surface finishes have been clearly distinguished from those technologies with the greatest strength virtually any tough durable and strong part can be finished to have a smooth paintready surface however the cost and time to do so may be prohibitive or the effects on part accuracy may be unacceptable as a result in the past companies may have elected to use a weaker less durable alternative to save time reduce cost and preserve feature details finishing prototypes tooling components or production parts can be done in several ways each with varying impact on lead time expense and quality the most common alternative is to sand a part by hand or with power tools overall this works well especially for parts of reasonable size with few features and details but when the part includes many features small details or deep cavities sanding becomes laborious time consuming and costly another consideration is that removing material makes dimensional accuracy a variable that changes with each individual that touches the part between sanding operations parts may have filler or primer applied this is a common technique when preparing a part for painting because it will deliver parts with very smooth finishes fillers and primers also help to preserves dimensional accuracy since depressions are filled before sanding them smooth but this paintready finish comes at a cost it takes much more time to apply multiple coats of fillers and primers and more labor to sand between each coat this increases the lead time and the expense for the part another method of smoothing parts that are made of thermoplastics is to melt the outer surface with a solvent parts may have mek or proweld brushed onto their surfaces or they can be dipped into a bath of the material the solvent causes the plastic to liquefy which fills in the low areas on the surface the solvents have the added benefit of sealing a porous surface yet there are some drawbacks small features may be distorted cavities may not be reached and drips will leave a visible mark another consideration is that drying times can be lengthy if the what industry needs especially when pursuing direct digital manufacturing ddm applications is a finishing technique that keeps lead times and costs to a minimum while delivering a robust functional part with high accuracy and crisp feature details applications examples of realworld applications of the smoothing process cover the entire spectrum from painted marketing samples to finished goods manufacturing since launching the smoothing station usage of fortus systems for a range of applications has expanded with the smoothing process companies are extending their use of fdm into applications that demand both functionality and smooth surfaces applications include 1 finishing master parts by painting or electroplating 2 tooling masters 3 sealing parts for liquid applications 4 thermoforming molds and 5 investment casting painting a leading automobile manufacturer estimates that it takes three days and 70000 to prepare a prototype frontend grill for painting over the course of three days workers apply body filler sand all surfaces spray on primer resand all surfaces and finish with a top coat of primer in stark contrast the same grill is smoothed and ready for paint in less than two hours total labor for the smoothing process is only hour and supplies costs less than 1000 while a 90 percent savings in time and expense is impressive the company found that the biggest benefit was in build to minimize the time to hand sand a grill the automotive company would build the fdm part in the same orientation that it is mounted on a car it would also construct the part with smaller slice thicknesses smoothing eliminates both of these time consuming measures by building the grill on its back with thicker slices the company reduced build times by more than half this decreased part cost accelerated delivery and increased machine capacity having more capacity and shorter lead times then resulted in less outsourcing which further reduced prototype expenses while keeping sensitive confidential design information within the a leading manufacturer of childrens toys and baby gear estimates that it paints nearly half of all additive fabrication parts that it makes in a year to prepare these parts for paint they are sanded filled sprayed with a primer coat and sanded once again this approach extends lead times consumes manpower and adds significant costs to the prototyping operation in an evaluation the company compared the hand finishing approach with the smoothing process for preparation of an infant seat for painting it discovered that it could reduce lead time and cost by more than 80 percent while the smoothing process was completed in under two hours for less than 4000 sanding and priming required six hours of labor and cost more than 25000 thermoforming a manufacturer of food packaging has used fdm tools for its thermoforming process when it conducts design validations the advantage of an fdm tool is that it can be built porous which allows a vacuum to be drawn through the entire part this allows the company to use the fdm tools as soon as the build is complete however it did not use these tools for marketing samples because the porous surface was too rough experimentation has demonstrated that the smoothing process allows the fdm mold to be dual purpose following the design verification the fdm mold is smoothed the glossy finish that results is ideal for the thermoformed marketing samples with the smoothing process the company can now thermoform design models and marketing samples in the same day the one small limitation of the smoothing process is that is seals the surface of the part which negates an advantage of an fdm thermoforming mold however the company discovered that it can simply pierce the skin of the fdm part in strategic locations since the smoothing process only penetrates 0010 inch 025 mm technicians can use any sharppoint tool to perforate the molds surface electroplating electroplaters have found that the smoothing process performs two essential functions in one operation the result is faster delivery lower expense and higher quality prior to the electroplating process parts must be smoothed and sealed rough surfaces are visible in the plated part and porosity allows the electroplating solutions to leech into the interior the traditional manual processes used to smooth and seal parts add to lead times and direct labor expenses they also introduce variances in part quality and accuracy hand sanding parts to reach a level of smoothness suited for polished metal surfaces is a time consuming process it also involves some craftsmanship that can lead to variations in part quality likewise sealing parts with primer can result in inconsistencies in the application of the primer and conductive coatings the alternative is to dip the parts in solvent but this can damage small details dipping also requires a long drying cycle of one to two days in contrast the smoothing process protects small features and fine details in electroplated parts while preserving dimensional consistency and it does so while minimizing direct labor and processing time in most cases parts are ready for electroplating in under two hours casting sand casting and investment casting foundries have implemented fdm to accelerate the patternmaking and toolmaking processes the one remaining hurdle to shorter lead times for highquality castings has been surface finishing because the quality of the casting is dependent on the quality of the pattern or tool time and labor are invested in each fdm part to manually finish the surfaces for investment casting hand finishing is a repetitive process since an fdm pattern is consumed for every metal casting besides the impact on time and cost hand working the patterns makes it difficult to maintain dimensional consistency from parttopart the smoothing process addresses all three issues simultaneously in one batch the smoothing station can process multiple fdm patterns in under an hour with only a few minutes of direct labor additionally the smoothing action is the same across all parts so there is consistency in the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the parts sand casting foundries use fdm patterns to produce core boxes copes drags and match plates that pack sand to make the casting tool foundries will also make these items directly from an fortus system eliminating the need for patterns whether it is an fdm pattern or fdm tool the smoothing process minimizes direct labor and lead time to deliver production sand castings the advantages of the smoothing process really grows when producing complex sand castings such as gear housings or steering knuckles one foundry notes that complex parts may need dozens of sand coreseach made from a different core box to reproduce internal passages and cavities hand finishing a dozen core boxes adds many days and countless labor hours by substituting the smoothing process the same work could be completed in a fraction of the time with very little direct labor the bottom line for the foundry is an increase in production capacity with a reduction in lead time conclusion companies are realizing impressive reductions in lead times and expenses when the smoothing station is used to finish and seal fdm parts independent of complexity and number of features the smoothing station creates a paintready finish in a just a few hours and it needs less than an hour of labor and 1000 worth of supplies the smoothing station has essentially automated the fdm additive fabrication finishing process it eliminates the time labor and expense of sanding filling and priming parts to achieve a smooth surface finish for production parts prototype tools and painted samples in doing so the smoothing station has removed any tradeoff between aesthetic quality and product functionality infant seat did this answer your question",

    "text": "some biblical roots of the teaching on the assumption of mary msgr charles pope august 14 2013 while the actual event of the assumption of mary in heaven is not recorded in the scriptures nevertheless there is a biblical basis for the teaching that considered as a whole confirms catholic teaching as both fitting and in keeping with biblical principles lets ponder this feast in three stages 1 explained to be assumed means to be taken up by god bodily into heaven as far back as the church can remember we have celebrated the fact that mary was taken up into heaven we do not just acknowledge that her soul was taken to heaven as is the case with all the rest of the faithful who are taken there likely after purgation rather mary was taken up soul and body into heaven after her sojourn on this earth was complete there is no earthly tomb containing her body neither are there relics of her body to be found among 2 exemplified the actual event of the assumption is not described in scripture however there are assumptions recorded in the scriptures and the concept is thus biblical it happened to enoch in the old testament the book of genesis records enoch walked with god then he was no more because god took him away gen 524 hebrews 11 5 elaborates by faith enoch was taken up so that he should not see death and he was not found because god had taken him now before he was taken he was attested as having pleased god it also happened to elijah as he walked with elisha and as they still went on and talked behold a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heavenand he was seen no more 2 kings 211 some say moses too was taken up since his grave is not known as we read in yesterdays first reading at mass he was buried in moab in the valley opposite beth peor but to this day no one knows where his grave is dt 346 the text of course does not say his body was taken up and if it was it occurred after death and burial jude 19 hints at the fact when is says but even the archangel michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of moses jude 19 some further credibility is lent to the view of him being assumed by the fact that he appears alongside elijah in the transfiguration account some of the church fathers held this view and there is also a jewish work from the 6th century ad entitled the assumption of moses that represents the tradition of his assumption but in the end the assumption of moses only a view held by some and it not officially held by the church and while it is true that the historical event of the assumption is not recorded in scripture nor are there historical accounts of the event there may be one other scriptural account that evidences marys whereabouts body and soul the church presents for our consideration in todays second reading a passage from the book of revelation wherein john records his sighting of the ark of god then gods temple in heaven was opened and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and a great hailstorm a great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head she was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth then another sign appeared in heaven an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that he might devour her child the moment it was born she gave birth to a son a male rev 1119 125 the woman is clearly mary since the child is clearly jesus though she also likely allegorizes other realities such as israel and mother zion and where is mary seen in heaven now some may argue the text does not necessarily indicate her body is in heaven but may only be referring to her soul however the physicality of the description of her is rather strong some also argue that mary is linked to johns sighting of the ark of the convent which is seen by john in heaven he mentions the ark and goes on to describe the woman clothed with the sun mary and there is a possibility that he is still describing the ark he sees in heaven i have written on this elsewhere see here mary the ark of the new covenant if she is the ark described that ark is clearly described as being in heaven so the biblical record while not recording the event of the assumption does set forth other assumptions and thus shows that assumption is a biblical concept further marys physical presence in heaven seems hinted at by john and some would argue that the passage actually attests to her physical presence there but remember the church does not rely solely on scripture in this case what we celebrate is most fundamentally taught to us by sacred tradition in that the memory of marys assumption goes back as long as we can remember 3 extended the feast of the assumption may be of theological interest to some and may provide for interesting biblical reflection but eventually the question is bound to come so what how does what happened to mary have impact on my life and what does it mean for me the answer to this question is bound up in nearly every marian doctrine simply put what happened to mary in an profound and preliminary way will also happen for us in the end as mary bore christ into he world we too bear him there in the holy communion we receive and in for now our souls go to heaven once purified but our body lie in a tomb but one day when the trumpet shall sound on that great gettin up morning our bodies will rise and be joined to our soul for we will all be changed in a flash in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed for the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality when the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality then the saying that is written will come true death has been swallowed up in victory where o death is your victory where o death is your stingthanks be to god he gives us the victory through 1 cor 155157 so our bodies shall rise shall be assumed and joined to our soul improved model now a older woman once said to me upon hearing that her body would rise father if this old body has to rise im hoping for an improved model yes indeed me too i want my hair back my slender figure and knees that work i want to upgrade from a general issue late model version to a luxury model and god will in fact do that scripture says he will take these lowly bodies of ours and transform them to be like his own glorified body phil 321 but someone may ask how are the dead raised with what kind of body will they come how foolish what you sow does not come to life unless it dies when you sow you do not plant the body that will be but just a seed perhaps of wheat or of something else but god gives it a body as he has determined and to each kind of seed he gives its own bodyso will it be with the resurrection of the dead the body that is sown is perishable it is raised imperishable it is sown in dishonor it 1 cor 153549 yes we shall also be taken up assumed and then shall be fulfilled for us the saying of job i know that my redeemer lives and that in the end he will stand upon the earth and after my skin has been destroyed yet in my flesh i will see god i myself will see him with my own eyesi and not another s job 192527 the assumption of our bodies prefigured by christ in his own power and also in mary by the gift of god will one day be our gift too for now it waits till that great gettin up morning until that day and on that day fare you well fare you well this song is an african american spiritual and speaks of that great gettin up morning when our bodies will rise and if we have been faithful they will rise to glory im gonna tell you about the coming of the judgement fare you well theres a better day a comingin that great gettin up morning fare you well oh preacher fold your bible for the last souls convertedblow your trumpet gabriellord how loud shall i blow it blow it right calm and easy do not alarm all my peopletell them to come to the judgementin that great

often gen 223 if christ in the ascension entered the heavenly eden since his physical body is somewhere and not simply only in heaven then the inauguration of the new creation could only be completed by the first woman of the new creation joining him in the flesh when adam says at last bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh he was uttering the first biblical prophesy he was before the fall a prophet priest and kingand this is his only prelapsarian statement so when else could christ have fulfilled this prophecy christs fulfilled this prophecy at the entrance of mary richardgtc says august 15 2013 at 1315 neat observation darwin paul says december 16 2013 at 2224 it is destined for man to die once and then the resurrection this is what jesus fulfilled in the fleshly body he lived righteously donna l says august 15 2013 at 1050 i always thought it was so interesting that there werent any relics from mary after all we know where peters and pauls are buried but i cant understand why eusebius didnt write about this tradition of the church he provides so many details about the apostles lives and deaths i wish he had written more about marys anyway its extremely reassuring to see all the scriptural support for this doctrine thank you monsignor hope youre having a blessed day gerard a mikula says august 15 2013 at 1105 our heavenly bodies will indeed be different for they will not contain the actual substance of our old earthly bodies but something new and wonderful composed of an entirerly new substance why do i say this consider that from what we understand from physics our bodies which are buried in the earth decompose eventually into their elemental form of carbon oxygen and hydrogen or at least elemental compounds such as carbon dioxide and water these elements are then recycled into the world mingling with the same compounds and elements from countless outher sources eventually they may also become part of the body of another person remember matter can not be either created or destroyed by humans that is so on judgement day the elements of our original bodies could also be part of other humans as we may have inhereted them from past humans this is probably why that cremation is now allowed in the church it is not possible that all of our original bodies can be raised on judgement day this brings up a point concerning the bodies of the icorruptable saints being perfectly preserved for hundreds of years what if these are the only ones that will truly rise on the last day a scary thought however there are many many others whom were much holier than all the incorruptable saints whose bodies were not incorruptable so hopefully this is not true gerard a mikula says august 15 2013 at 1130 as per my previous note i am in no way disputing what the church says concerning the last judgement i am a practical devout humbly speaking cradle catholic who believes in the church with my whole heart do not take anything here to mean ortherwise richardgtc says august 15 2013 at 1319 excellent post i liked the painting a lot too in this life we recognize body first and then soul for something is observed far away we know it is a body of some sort then we realize that it is moving toward and so we know it is an animal of some sort then we recognize finally that he is a man we recognize soul last when we have spiritualized bodies i think that we will recognize soul first vicky hernandez says august 15 2013 at 1432 let us all pray for our blessed mothers intervention for egypt the land that provided shelter for her st joseph and little jesus and especially for the persecuted church in all of the middle east annette strachan says august 15 2013 at 1448 as a child mary ascended the steps of the temple for her presentationas depicted in a recent calendar gloria schotten says august 15 2013 at 1652 the following poem from his ecclesiastical sonnets is a tribute to the blessed virgin mary william wordsworth <phone> the virgin mother whose virgin bosom was uncrost with the least shade of thought to sin allied woman above all women glorified our tainted natures solitary boast robb says august 15 2013 at 1840 i understand that the basilica of mary major in rome depicts a fresco of mary assumed bodily into heaven done about 350 ad carl sommer says august 16 2013 at 1053 robb the church of santa maria maggiore in rome was built in the 350s but the fresco of the assumption was created by ludovico cardi in the 16tgh century so this fresco does not constitute early evidence for a belief in the assumption the best early evidence is that laid out in this article in my humble opinion mbe florence emmanuel says february 23 2015 at 0419 the lord is our strength he wil transform us and make us whole dat day wil be a wndaful day haleluya james says may 28 2016 at 2005 the reason i believe its not in the scriptures is very simple the commandment honor thy father and thy mother jesus came not to abolish but to fulfill the law he honors his mother she is not only assumed into heaven she is also coronated it makes perfect sense where is the need karen peebles says january 30 2017 at 1538 your facts are faulty there is not one single shred of historical fact that shows that moses was taken up bodily into heaven in fact the bible clearly states that he died and was buried and went to be with his fathers as well there is not a single piece of evidence showing that mary was assumed into heaven the bible the inspired word of god does not say so no other authoritative piece of literature states that she was this is catholic madeup nonsense pure and simple i can guess that my great great great grandfather was assumed into stained glass and the book of revelation how our church buildings reflect the heavenly vision of st john welcome to 1950 a surprising statistic about the number of priests per parish",

    "text": "february 20 2011 by shacker the compleat guide to digitizing your lp collection for anyone over 40 or maybe 30 having a music collection probably means that in addition to racks of cds and ridiculous piles of mp3s youre also sitting on bookshelves or borrowed milk crates full of vinyl lps hundreds of pounds of spaceconsuming damageprone vinyl lps were music you could touch with glorious fullcolor 12 album art meandering liner notes and the practical involvement of lowering needle to plastic longplaying records represent an era when music was less disposable we actually sat down to listen rather than treating music as a backdrop to the rest of life dragging a rock through vinyl was not some kind of nostalgic love affair with the past it was just the way things were the cost of admission was pops and scratches warped discs having to get up in the middle of an album to flip the disc cleaning the grooves from time to time and getting hernias every time you moved to a new apartment we loved our vinyl despite and because of its warts but we also didnt hesitate to go digital when the time came first with cds and then with mp3s and other filebased formats we complained that cds lacked the warmth of vinyl but cd technology got better over time we complained that the typical mp3 was encoded at bitrates too low to do justice to the music but we learned to encode at higher resolutions or to use uncompressedlossless formats eventually most of us gave in to temptation and started listening only or mostly to files stored on a computer i personally held onto around 700 records made before the 90s in addition to a few boxes of records my parents left in my care most of my cd purchases from the 90s and 00s had been ripped long ago but the lps were locked in limbo wasnt listening to them but couldnt bear to let go either in 2011 i finally decided it was time to hunker down and digitize the stacks to unforget all those excellent records digitizing lps has almost nothing in common with ripping cds its a slow process and a lot of work but it can be incredibly rewarding and going through the process puts you back in touch with music the way it used to be played ie its a great nostalgia trip in this guide ill cover the process of prepping your gear cleaning your records and capturing as much of the essence of those old lps as possible so you can enjoy them in the context of your digital life setting up so you want to digitize your lp collection thats awesome but slow down cowboy this isnt going to happen overnight when you rip a cd the whole process is pretty much automatic stick it in click go and youre done in minutes my imacs optical drive rips at around 16x the metadata album title artist track names recording year and album art are often retrieved automatically and you never give a thought to dealing with surface noise but when you square off with a stack of lps you find out quick that youve got some hurdles to clear i was process a long one its going to take a while to get your gear in order youve got several decisions to make and each lp you rip is going to take actual time fortunately once you get a groove on things flow pretty smoothly you just have to forget that youve been spoiled by the ease of ripping cds change mental gears back to analog mode and look forward to getting handson with your music again heres the general roadmap ill go into each of these separately below tune your table make the connection clean your vinyl pick the right software decide what to rip and what to toss and what to repurchase pick an output format establish a workflow deal with noise export tracks tune your table and cartridge because of the time involved you want to go through this process exactly once if youre going to do this thing do it right you need to think now about a listening picture bigger than your iphone and earbuds bigger than your desktop computer speakers the ultimate goal is that you can play the final result through the best amp and speakers you can find and itll be indistinguishable from the original or as close to it as possible in fact it may even be better if you filter out pops and scratches carefully who knows what kind of home stereo youre going to have 10 or 30 years from now think longterm so if the process is so timeconsuming why not just repurchase everything if youre sitting on a lot of lps buying a new digital copy of every album is going to be expensive even though a lot of older lps are available at emusiccom and mp3amazoncom for 57 sure your time may be worth more than what it takes to digitize everything yourself but not everything needs to be an roitimeismoney calculation right if you havent thought much about your turntable for two decades take time out to make sure its in top condition before beginning it makes no sense to spend dozens or hundreds of hours digitizing if the audio quality is going to be diminished for want of a new needle or because your cartridge hums or your turntable transmits motor noise think of yourself as an archivist creating a collection youll be proud to pass down to your children i was pretty happy with my old pioneer pla35 built solid and totally reliable but i had forgotten how long it had been since id replaced the cartridge and needle contacted jim at needle doctor and told him i wanted the best setup he could recommend for a benjamin or less he suggested the ortofon m2 red and i went for it to blow your own mind surf around the phono cartridges section of that site to see what you can get for 15 large yes 15k to be sure id made a good decision i digitized the same album both before and after installing the ortofon and the difference in tonal range and responsiveness was very audible a new cartridge was a worthwhile investment if youre not sure whether your turntable is up to snuff take it to a qualified audio shop and ask their opinion you might want to have them do an alignment and lubrication or let them talk you into a new turntable hooking up the turntablecomputer connection traditional turntables output audio at a level lower than standard linelevel in other words you cant just plug a turntables rca cables into your computer and expect it to work youll need either a dedicated phono preamp or a turntable with a builtin line stage or usb jack there are a lot of turntables on the market with builtin usb connections many of them specifically designed for digitizing old collections but many of them are cheap pieces of lightweight junk and just not worth it especially the inexpensive models in most cases youll be better off with a welldesigned traditional table and outboard analogdigital converter adc there are a dozen or so usb phono preamps available on amazon ranging from 501200 my darling wife got me the nad pp3 for christmas around 200 but no longer available since it has both usb and rca outputs ill still be able to use it in the home stereo for standard lp playback once the digitization process is complete though itll be connected to my computer for the foreseeable future honestly i cant tell you what to look for in a usb adcpreamp in general you get what you pay for the cheapest one of anything is almost never the right decision but the really highend audio stuff works in a realm of subsonic quality differences that my ears simply cant hear once connected to my imac i went to the systems sound preferences panel and selected the nad as the input i did have to reboot the machine before it was recognized surprisingly after that output from the turntable was available to all the audio capture software i tested make sure the turntable is resting on a solid desk and is not overly sensitive to footsteps in the room you dont want perceptible warbling in the audio when walking nearby if you have kids make sure they know to walk softly when daddys busy ripping you dont want to find out that some of your recordings were marred by vibrations months later after youve finished the process and ditched some of your lps if youre in a room with a bouncy floor consider setting up your digistation in another room maybe with a laptop dedicated to the process cleaning your vinyl dust noise the quality of my vinyl collection spans the gamut from old garage sale finds and handmedowns to impeccable 180gram vinyl from mosaic and everything in between most records that have been in my personal care have been sleeved and played with the cover down all their lives and so have fairly minimal dust nonetheless virtually all of my records turned up some dust in the cleaning process since youre shooting for archival quality here you want that stuff out of the grooves before encoding in addition depending on your environment your records probably have collected a static electrical charge that can affect the quality of the final output dak has a great page full of electron microscope photographs showing lp surfaces before and after cleaning with their system if you dont think your records are dusty or that dust and static can affect recording quality give it a read dust in record grooves as seen with an electron microscope check the dak page for more examples there are a number of vinyl cleaning systems out there from simple brushes to carbon microfibers to fullon record vacuuming systems i wanted to clean but wasnt going to get all mad scientist about it found my old discwasher brush from the 70s still in amazingly good shape after all this time but the fluid bottle was dry using fluid is important not just for cleaning purposes but also to dampen or remove residual static charge a bit of searching turned up dozens of homebrew fluid recipes and i settled on this one 3 parts distilled water triple distilled deionized 1 part isopropyl alcohol 91 lab grade a few drops of photographic wetting agent if possible triton x100 triton x110 or triton x115 or monolan 2000 not kodak photoflo which is reputed to leave a residue though used by some recommended is 12 drops per gallon or 23 drops per litre though some use up to 8 drops per litre if you add too much the fluid gets sudsy on the record not having easy access to photoflo or its cousins i substituted a few drops of windshield wiper fluid as recommended at another site sounds strange but because the dilution is so great figured a microamount of what is essentially windexsoap couldnt hurt because i had so many records to do i made almost a quart of the stuff in advance which i transfer to the little discwasher squirt bottle as necessary before recording each side i squirt two lines of fluid onto the leading edge of the brush and do a slow steady roll from wet side to dry side results have been great and ive pulled visible amounts of dust out of virtually lp side ive cleaned everything you can do to extract all the audio goodness possible out of your lps is worth doing within reason dont skip the cleaning process pick the right digitizing software technically you could use any audio software capable of digitizing twotrack audio and outputting to mp3 or other formats but theres a heck of a lot more to the process than capturing audio digitizing lps is an entire workflow which involves capturing finding track boundariessplitting tracks looking up metadata album title artist year genre individual track titles album art cleaning up clicks and scratches cleaning up other noise hum etc outputting to multiple formats if your software cant help with every part of that process youre going to waste a lot of time doing things manually that should be semiautomatic you want software thats built specifically for the lpcassette digitization workflow and that means that software such as audacity garage band and even pro tools are out of the running i cant stress this enough do not waste your time with generalpurpose audioediting software use software purposebuilt for digitizing lps since lps cant be looked up automatically in a database like itunes and other ripping software does with cds you need software that can make the track naming process easier i tried a few apps before settling on alpinesofts vinyl studio a trial version came with the nad preamp and i was blown away by how much easier it made things than the audacitybased workflow i had been working with previously available for both windows and mac vinylstudio does everything listed above and uses a tabbed interface to segment the workflow intuitively its not gorgeous by modern mac software standards but it does exactly what it claims to do and it does it really well two features alone make it completely worth the 30 integration with external track databases tell vinylstudio the artist and album name and itll try to find that album in musicbrainz discogs and other open sourcecollaborative music databases select one its search results and vinylstudio will use that data to suggest track breaks which means you dont have to find all the track breaks yourself and you dont have to type in all the track names by hand if it cant find a match vinylstudio has a scan for track breaks feature that will do its best to mark the quiet sections between tracks youll still have to type in track names manually in that case but its still a time saver over finding track breaks manually more on this process later startstop recording on needle updown one thing you dont want is to have to sit there babysitting the turntable waiting for one side to end so you can pause recording and start the other vinylstudio listens for needle down and up thresholds which means you can leave the room and trust that recording will have stopped when you return after dinner when you have hundreds of lps to import this feature alone is worth the price of admission for albums that vinylstudio couldnt find in thirdparty databases i also got a bit of help getting everything tagged correctly with a 30 app called coverscout which examines your collection for missing artwork then looks it up in google images amazon and other services a bit pricey but i ended up with hundreds of albums without artwork and coverscout helped me get them all decorated money well spent of course i didnt try everything on the market i stopped looking when i found vinylstudio got others to recommend leave a note in the comments what to rip and what to toss and what to repurchase because the process is so timeconsuming youll probably want to start by eliminating lps that you simply dont care about anymore i personally made three piles discard sell encode then discard encode then keep i was able to put about a quarter of my records in the discard pile which reduced the workload quite a bit since im a romantic fool my plans for much of the second category were thwarted by nostalgia there are a lot of records i havent played for 20 years and that im going to have nice clean digital versions of when done but that i still cant bring myself to discard oscar browns 1972 fresh yeah gotta keep that no idea why maybe because i love the cover lps have a weird effect on me so the second in most cases the decision about what to repurchase was based on the condition of the lp if after digitization and cleaning i still wasnt happy with the sound id delete what id just digitized and go find a pristine copy at emusiccom or mp3amazoncom or every so often at itunes though their prices are virtually always higher itunes sells music encoded at 256kbps aac equivalent to 320kbps mp3 while emusic and mp3amazon sell music at a fairly high vbr variable bit rate which means the bitrate goes up for complex passages and down for simple passages more on vbr one thing that surprised me was how often id find records that i decided needed to be repurchased only to find that i couldnt i understand when an lp or cd goes out of print in physical format but in the digital world whats the point of anything being out of print isnt that what the long tail is all about selling small amounts of old things because it basically costs nothing to do so for example one of my favorite bill evans records of all times spring leaves on fantasymilestone with scott lafaro and paul motian youll find dozens of evans records on emusic itunes and mp3amazon but not this one same deal with public images first issue funkadelics uncle jam wants you and the ink spots torch time nowhere to be found at the online stores youd think the online catalogs would have everything but licensing apparently gets in the way for these and many others i had no choice but to encode from lp and do my best to clean them up there were also records that presented interesting challenges like the fugs it crawled into my hand honest which includes many tracks that flow into one another some as short as 10 seconds long deciding where to place track breaks with these was a challenge the right thing to do is to let these flowtogether tracks remain as a single uninterrupted file but if you do that you end up with fewer total tracks than are shown on the albums track listing so the encoded set doesnt look complete and what are you going to name the flowtogether tracks i encountered everything and to just be happy owning the lps nothing wrong with that right fakes in the 70s i was a sucker for those ktel and ronco hit collections and i picked up quite a few more in the 80s for camp value but digitizing these was going to be a lot of extra manual work since i wasnt having luck looking them up in the musicbrainz or other databases and all the artist names were different it was also going to involve figuring out all the overlap a lot of these records duplicate songs from each other so i decided to just repurchase a few of them and call it a day easier said than done the original collections arent available at any of the services so i at first i thought it was just me but do a search like this and look for the collections with 1star ratings click on those and read the customer comments something very weird is going on here and im not sure what i wrote to amazon and complained and they cheerfully refunded the money i was impressed by that but still not sure how to proceed with the ktelronco collections will probably just bite the bullet and do them manually i have not experienced this problem with any other purchased downloads just the 70s collections picking an output format 3000yearold egyptian papyrus is still readable today but 1990s word processing documents written in wordstar images made on a 1978 atari video created on an early version of windows good luck finding a way to read any of those formats you see where im going with this lps were entrenched in our culture for decades and i expect it will be easy to find a turntable capable of playing any of the records made throughout the 20th century for many decades to come but file formats are somewhat transient as better ones come along the old ones slide into obsolescence i had two criteria in selecting an output file format i wanted the best quality possible while using a reasonable amount of disk space and i wanted to not feel paranoid that the file format would be obscure in 20 or 30 years im creating an archive here and that means i want this stuff around for a very long time to come i want to be able to pass this music on to my son someday wav and aiff are the two main uncompressed formats and theyre so ubiquitous im sure theyll be readable for decades to come but ive got 500 records to encode here and im not willing to commit that much disk space yes storage is cheap but 500 records in an uncompressed format on top of the 200gbs of music ive already stored could mean having to move to multiple drives which would be a pain to access as a single music library formats like apple lossless alac and flac free lossless codec save around 50 of the disk space over wavaiff another factor that tipped the scales against lossless for me was the fact that dynamic range has been so squashed out by modern recording techniques ive written about this before but the point is made well in in this cnet article the loudness wars of the 90s ruined all the quality gains digital music had made listening to a recording as a flac or apple lossless file cant undo dynamic range compression or overzealous equalization its true that most of my lps were originally recorded before the 1990s so this problem wont affect most of my stuff but i do have a number of more modern records for which it is a factor bottom line is that i just cant perceive enough difference between flacalac and highbitrate mp3 to make the extra disk space and the prospect of obsolescence worth it amongst lossy compressed formats aac is the default codec used with itunes its the audio layer of mpeg4 and has pretty deep penetration mp3 of course is the granddaddy of audio compression and is simply everywhere i have no doubt mp3s will be readable 50 years from now with aac and mp3 quality goes up as bitrate goes up as file size goes up a 320kbps mp3 is to my ears completely indistinguishable from an alac or flac file and uses about a third of the space and using vbr levelzero compression gets you the same quality as 320kbps cbr vbrzero provided the best balance between audio quality file size and promise of permanence your mileage may vary and i respect you no matter what you decide no format wars please for more on mp3 compression see cbr vs vbr below if youre willing to invest in a giant hard drive and have a way to keep it backed up offsite you have another option save the original uncompressed version in a digital storage vault and put the compressed version in your regular library for daily use in vinylstudio you start with recordings which should be in a highquality uncompressed format you then output your cleaned up audio at the end of the process so in essence this twoformat process is baked into the vinylstudio workflow if you want it to be but i didnt go that far i just kept here are notes from my listening tests as i was deciding on an output format bought a copy of steely dans aja from the itunes store 256kbps aac for reference then digitized versions of the same album from lp with old shure cartridge uncorrected vbr0 mp3 pretty good but had slight hum new ortofon cartridge uncorrected vbr0 mp3 more range less hum good purchase new ortofon cartridge corrected vbr0 mp3 by corrected i mean with pops and scratches removed a process that cleans up the signal quite a bit but with a very very slight impact on dynamic range of course the purchased aac version sounded the cleanest being completely free of surface noise but the lp versions felt richer and more alive this test verified my decision that i wasnt losing anything noticeable by going with mp3 and gave me the opportunity to listen really closely to differences between the corrected and uncorrected versions this was a tough one there is a very slight and i mean very slight difference in tonal range postcorrection but at the same time the click reduction is dramatic and definitely did enhance the quality of the listening experience however every correction you make has a slight impact on overall audio quality since every record is in different condition you may decide that the quality hit isnt in a second experiment the guinea pig was a 180gram audiophile recording of sonny rollins way out west a true treasure of jazz for this one i did four encodings with the new ortofon cartridge alac corrected alac uncorrected mp3 vbr0 corrected mp3 vbr0 uncorrected i then dewaxed my ears plunked down in the sweet spot in the living room cranked it up and did my closest listening trying to decide whether i wanted to go corrected or uncorrected from here on out same conclusions i like the clickcorrected audio better for most lps even when dealing with a really high quality lp in good physical condition clickreduction removes enough surface noise to enhance the overall experience then i listened to the corrected alac and mp3 versions side by side queuing them up to the same passages for reference i could tell a difference but it was incredibly subtle the alac version was just the tiniest bit fuller very slightly more resonant but the difference was so subtle that it felt like splitting hairs if youre doing any of the things most people do while listening to music dancing working studying doing dishes having a dinner party there simply is no practical difference this is the opinion of my ears and is not a recommendation do your own tests since the alac versions are more than twice as large filesizewise and because of my hesitancy about the futurecompatibility of alac i made my final decision id be saving vbr0 mp3 clickcorrected audio from here on out note vinylstudio can also do a wide array of rumble hum and other noise corrections since i was already very happy with the sound and not wanting to mess with things further decided not to tweak those i just do a quick clickscan pass at the end of each recording and move on to the next cbr vs vbr lame is the mp3 encoder used by vinylstudio and most other mp3 creation software these days and it rocks today lame is considered the best mp3 encoder at midhigh bitrates and at vbr mostly thanks to the dedicated work of its developers and the open source licensing model that allowed the project to tap into engineering resources from all around the world both quality and speed improvements are still happening probably making lame the only mp3 encoder still being actively developed mp3 files can be generated either at a constant bit rate cbr which means that every second of audio has exactly the same number of bits or at variable bit rate vbr which means more data is allocated to complex passages of audio and fewer bits to simpler passages rather than shooting for a consistent bit rate vbr encoding shoots for a consistent level of quality which is what we really care about ten years ago when i was writing mp3 the definitive guide for oreilly 320kbps cbr was considered the pinnacle of mp3 encoding techniques but vbr technology has improved steadily in the past decade and lames handling of vbr is the best its been tweaked and tested endlessly by audiophile engineers on equipment that costs more than your car vbr encoding lets you select a quality level set not in kilobits per second but with a target quality ranging from 0 to 9 where 0 is the best and 9 is the worst level zero vbr with the lame encoder really is the best quality youre going to get with mp3 today and it is truly excellent at very reasonable file sizes roughly 2mbs per minute there actually is one level of quality beyond zero which lame calls insane but as this chart illustrates the quality increase at the insane setting is negligible while the file size spikes upwards file size increases as quality increases but at a certain point you hit the wall of diminishing returns establish a workflow with your gear dialed in and all the big decisions made youre ready to dive in its going to take a bit of practice before things start to feel smooth the first few records you rip are going to involve some trial and error but pretty soon youll have a satisfying workflow happening of course youll need to capture your records in realtime unlike cd ripping which can happen at up to 16x add in the time to clean split and massage track breaks look up metadata and find album art and you can expect the process to take about vinylstudio includes excellently detailed documentation on every step of the process and you should definitely read up but heres my overview create an album record look up metadata find track boundariessplit tracks clean up pops and scratches export can be done in batch mode when you first set up vinylstudio ill call it vs from here on itll ask you to set a recording format this is not the same as the output format you can output to any format later in the game its asking in which format you want to store the recordings internally these are the versions youll be splitting up into tracks declicking burning to cd if you swing that way and possibly storing in your longterm highfidelity storage vault i chose aiff 44khz 16 bit if youre going to export to mp3 later youll need to install the lame encoder and tell vs where to find it the program does not come with its own mp3 encoder for copyright reasons follow the directions carefully and make sure you get the recommended version other builds of lame come with libraries in formats that vs cant use the vs interface is arranged in tabs that mirror the general workflow start with the record tab and enter the artist and album recording year and genre of the lp you want to start with this is needed for file and folder name creation your own reference and to give hints to the lookup feature so it can find track names and lengths for you later on if you have an analog hookup youll need to pay attention to your recording levels most digital interfaces dont allow altering the recording volume so just click the big ol record button vs wont start recording immediately itll wait for the burst of noise generated by a needle drop so you can now spin up the turntable and clean your record when you physically lower the needle actual recording will begin about 10 seconds after the end of side 1 recording will pause automatically flip the record clean and click continue recording will resume when you drop the needle again when recording is complete switch to the split tracks tab and click lookup track listing use the database dropdown to tell vs where to look for metadata i have the best luck with musicbrainz and discogs but there are other options keep in mind that all of the data in these databases is submitted by end users like you that means the album covers will all be shot differently and the track lengths and placements will be slightly different since there are often many different pressings of the same album and because people startstop recording at different times expect to click import album art when you find the best cover shot and use selected listing when you find the track list that best matches the record youre actually working with then click close if youre lucky all of the suggested track breaks will pretty much line up on the waveform with your actual record in some cases however the breaks the red lines will match at first then drift pretty badly if this happens you have three choices you can 1 return to lookup and try to find another listing that fits your actual tracks better or 2 keep the listing and adjust it manually not difficult or 3 click the scan for trackbreaks button and let vs autodetect the breaks the cool thing is if you try approach 3 the actual track track breaks were found from a discogs lookup for this double lp but theyre way off manual track alignment is needed with virtually every album some more than others if your record couldnt be found in any of the lookup services things get a bit more manual click scan for trackbreaks and let vs do its thing about 10 seconds later youll see breaks placed at the bestguess locations which are usually pretty good but youll still need to massage them make sure vs shows as many tracks are on the actual album if not youll need to study the waveform even more closely to find the ones it missed place the cursor where you want a break and hit cmdb to insert a new break when the number even though youve gotten a big leg up by pulling in metadata from discogs and musicbrainz youll quickly realize that the timestamps for the track breaks retrieved are from other peoples recordings because people hit record at different times theyre going to be off by anywhere from 220 seconds which means you still need to manually massage every single track break to get it right some lps are really difficult to split up for example my 1953 folkways recording leadbellys last sessions the bands tracks on the lp are divided into band 1 band 2 band 3 etc but within each of those bands are multiple songs band 1 actually consists of three different songs with no clear separator between them should i split it across bands or try to find the song breaks which are tough to listen for and arent visible in the waveform hes talking in the background between the actual songs id like to have tracks named for songs of course now to finesse the breaks the most manual part of the process start by zooming in close you can use either the icons or the scroll wheel on your mouse note that each track break has a doubleended arrow at the top green for start red for end you can turn the breaks into gaps by holding down the shift key and dragging the break line this creates a shaded area that will be excluded from the final output the general process is zoom in drag the playhead the black line to the area you want to study and use the spacebar to startstop playback move the playhead to a position close to the end of a track hit spacebar and listen until the track fades to absolute silence then hit spacebar again to stop playback drag the track break line to the to the black playhead line if you want to cut out some of the space so there arent long silences at the start and end of your output tracks hold down shift while dragging the break line as you drag a shaded gap will become visible hit spacebar again and playback will resume from the end of the gap adjust the in and 0utpoints for the gap until theres about a second of silence beforeafter detectable audio of the previousnext track pictured the autodiscovered track break was off by about 15 seconds fixing this was a fourstep process listenview for the correct end of the previous track and put the playhead there move the break line to the cursor line shiftdrag the break line to create a gap dial in the position for the end of the gap when your track splitting work is done the waveform should look something like this with some tracks being separated by gaps especially between album sides others not with splitting done its time to determine whether the recording will sound better with the audio cleaned up or not since theres a small impact on audio quality with every correction you make you want to keep these to a minimum and only apply them on an asneeded basis in truth i found that most of my records had enough pops and crackles to make it worth applying click correction to most records use your ears and use your judgement go to the cleanup tab and find the icon on the bottom toolbar that looks like a doubleended checkmark circled in red here which is the scan for clicks option vs will show a dialog with a bunch of sensitivity options these are welldocumented and all i can say is read and experiment i just took the defaults with most recordings red circle the click removal tool red square toggle click protection on or off the process will take a minute or two depending on the speed of your computer its pretty amazing how many clicks vs will find and remove dont be surprised to see the final count measured in thousands once the process is complete its time to put on your ear goggles and listen carefully with click removal on and off use the gamma symbol icon outlined with red square above to toggle check both dense and sparse passages listening carefully for the impact of click removal on tonality and range the difference will be fairly subtle if you used vss default settings but it is noticeable again youll want to make this judgement on a perrecord basis if a record is in great shape youll be better off not using click protection now youre ready to export select the save tracks tab and youll see a list of all the albums youve recorded you can either export your albums to mp3 one at a time or do them in batches im doing them in batches of around a dozen dig around and youll find options to select the output format bit rate and whether to have albums added to itunes since the mp3 encoding process can take a while when batch processing this is something you might want to do once a week before going to bed when export is complete switch over to itunes and select the recently added playlist make sure all of the recently added tracks have solid metadata they should at this point and album art if you werent able to find album art in the lookup stage now is the time to search for the album title in google images and save the highest quality album cover you can find to your desktop select all the tracks in that album hit cmdi and drag the image from the finder to the artwork square in the itunes info panel alternatively you can try pollux shareware app to retrieve missing metadata and cover art but i found i didnt need it much keeping archival copies maybe you want to save mp3s to your collection or to an ipod but also want to keep highdef aiff or flac files around for posterity vinylstudio makes this twophase workflow natural by baking it into the process initially you set up your recording preferences which refer to the nativeinternal recording format go ahead and set this to some highresolution format these will become the albums you record into vinylstudio while creating mp3s out of them comes as part of the export process save tracks if all you want out of the deal are mp3s you can always delete the set internal album recording format to aiff process a dozen or so albums skipping the save tracks export step before going to bed one night go to save tracks select all and output to mp3 vbr0 and import to itunes delete all the saved albums from the save tracks tab if i wanted to keep the highresolution aiff originals in an archive i would simply skip step 4 and manually copy those aiff files from the finder to a longterm storage drive or service thats it youre digitalized baby keep at it you should be able to complete 23 albums a day during the work week and more on the weekends i expect ill be at it for the better part of 2011 before pillaging my friends collections for more update end of 2011 there were around 500 lps altogether but many i had since also acquired on cd or mp3 so didnt need to do those also skipped quite a few that were just too surface noisy that left around 300 heres a little screencast of the ones that actually needed digitizing i also got really anal about finding good cover art what i couldnt find on the net i photographed myself your browser does not currently recognize any of the video

    "text": "range report springfield armory emp 4 by dave dolbee published on may 19 2016 in firearms range reports i know there are a lot of fans of the 9mmparticularly after the fbi switched back to the 9mm and a ton of police departments followed suit on the other hand the 45 acp has it followers led by the champions of the 1911 the solution how about a purpose built 1911 for the 9mm its sacrilege to some and perfection to others but how it performs is all that really counts the springfield armory emp 4 pistol is a winner and worthy of trusting your life to the emp is not a new line for springfield in fact springfield launched the enhanced micro pistol emp about a decade ago the intent was to offer a subcompact 9mm in a 1911 configuration it was the perfect blend of caliber and the 1911 platform in a concealable packagethanks to the 3inch barrel the emp was the perfect blend not because two popular elements were brought together but rather because the emp was built from the ground up to be a 9mmunlike many 1911 45 designs that are merely converted to accommodate a smaller caliber to do this engineers had as was true with cell phones tablets and other technologies devices keep getting smaller and smaller until they become too small to be useful for many pocket pistols suffered from this to a degree although there are a few pocket or micro pistols that i regularly employ as a bug back up gun for me the key is as a back up to ever need a defensive pistol means thing has to have gone very wrong to need a back up to a defensive pistol means things have gone horribly wrong that being said bugs have their place and i the dual magazine holder is handy on the range or during minor competitions enter springfields new for 2016 emp 4 smaller than a full frame 5inch 1911 but more controllable and accurate than a 3inch model and because it is chambered for the 9mm the emp 4 also enjoys a capacity advantage speaking of capacity in addition to the 4inch barrel the emp 4s grip has been extended by 5inch this provides just enough length to get all of your my anyway fingers on the grip plus it adds a round giving the emp 4 a 101 capacity all totaled the emp offers a familiar manual of arms and a fine balance for the details as would be expected for a pistol of this size the emp 4 is a singlestack singleaction semiauto pistol the design is pure john browning inspired right down to the linkedbarrel design the slide is constructed from stainless steel while the frame cuts the needed weight to make it a viable carry option by utilizing a matte black hardanodized lightweight aluminum frame the result is a sleek and stylish twotone finish target acquisition is quick and sight alignment sure thanks to the low profile dovetailed novakstyle rear sight featuring dual white dots the front sight is an orange fiber optic infused blade that is well placed for durability the sight placement makes the most of the sight radius for increased accuracy potential the emp comes standard with a lockable carry case three 10round magazines paddle holster dual magazine pouch cleaning brush rear sight tool and cable lock the emp 4 features a 4inch stainless steel matchgrade bull barrel with a fully supported feed ramp there isnt a tactile loaded chamber indicator but the top of the chamber has a small witness hole that serves as a visual indicator the barrel is fitted at the muzzle with a removable barrel bushing the recoil assembly utilizes a fulllength steel guide rod which supports a single flatwire spring held in place by a reverse spring plug the aluminum frame follows traditional lines so it does not have an accessory rail the trigger consists of a long skeletonized aluminum matchgrade trigger with a serrated face and broke cleanly at 5 pounds 3 ounces the front strap of the grip frame features springfields posilok reverseconeessentially a cross between dimpling and checkering that provides a solid hand purchase without requiring a flesh donation every time you fire it adding to the posilok s grip enhancement are the thinline cocobolo wood grip panels that also feature a diamond pattern checkering the framemounted controls including the slide stop magazine release hammer and grip safety is all constructed of matte black 4140carbon steel the thumb safety is designed to be low profile and ambidextrous for concealed carry the magazine release button is textured and otherwise standard fare from the back the emp 4 utilizes an extended beavertail grip safety with memory bump to enhance grip consistency the emp 4 comes standard with three 10round blued steel magazines that are manufactured by mecgar in italy and feature a metallic follower and slam pad polymer base plate it also has a quality hard case at 10 yards the emp 4 outshot the author regularly shooting groups such as these overall the fit and finish on the emp was beyond excellent in fact it borders custom grade on the range concealed carry may lead to last line of defense so many prefer selfdefense loads rated as p i am normally hesitant to shoot these from a compact pistol so i started with a variety of loads ranging from range ammo such as winchester white box and worked through 115 124 and finally 147grain loads the emps balance feel and textured grip left little doubt when i grabbed the first of the p loads the hotter the load the more you are going to feel the snap of the recoil with any pistol and the more wear you are going to the springfield armory emp 4 pistol is a winner and worthy of trusting your life to it is accurate enough to confidently defend yourself at the outer limits of selfdefense ranges but still small and sleek enough to comfortable conceal and carry best of all for a fan of the 9mm such as myself you can afford plenty of ammunition which will lead to longer and more frequent range sessions however for those looking for something that pushes a bigger pea the emp 4 will soon be offered in 40 sw the look and more importantly feel of the emp 4 is all 1911 with excellent balance and controls specifications manufacturer springfield armory model emp 4 pi9211lp action

    "text": "aug 12 first spin 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye and dodge challenger rt scat pack comments written by rick cotta in coupes dodge engines fastest first spin new review sportyperformance cars 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat widebody left and rt scat pack widebody you had to figure this was coming after setting the record books ablaze last year with the dodge challenger srt demon and keeping its promise that it would be a oneyearonly model dodge unveiled a more streetable version of much the same car for 2019 plus it carried over some of the demons dragracing technology to a more budgetpriced model aimed at well drag racing certainly theres an allure to an 800 horsepower car that can do the 14mile in under 10 seconds but the demon not only sacrificed some streetability to achieve those numbers but it cost nearly 90000 and was hard to get even for that so dodge followed it up with a challenger sporting nearly the same power but with more of an everyday focus and a much lower price although challengers aimed at such had long been strong performers dodge really upped the ante for 2015 with the debut of the srt hellcat which made great waves at the time with its 707horsepower supercharged engine and though the model continued for 2018 it was somewhat overshadowed at least in terms of press coverage by the demon but not only does the hellcat return for 2019 with 10 more horsepower now 717 its price has been dropped by about 5000 to start at 58650 61745 after destination and gasguzzler tax and its offered with either a 6speed manual transmission or 8speed automatic furthermore its joined by a redeye variant carrying an only slightly detuned version of the demons engine rated at 797 horsepower which comes in at 11 grand more both models get a new dualsnorkel hood reminiscent of those offered on the original early70s challengers and both are available in widebody form that adds a sport suspension and fender flares covering wider wheels and tires a combination said to cut lap times and provide a bit more traction during acceleration both bee fender badges now face forward on the 2019 dodge challenger rt scat packs but if your tastes run more to under50grand machines dodge has you covered next step down the line is the rt scat pack and theres now more than one the base model starts at 38995 40390 with destination an extra 1000 with the manual transmissions gasguzzler tax and features a 485horsepower 64liter hemi v8 392 cubic inches for you old school sorts offered with either a 6speed manual or 8speed automatic transmission its also available in widebody form with wider wheels and tires fender flares stiffer adaptivedamping suspension integrated front splitter below the bumper and a rear spoiler from the hellcat model all for an extra 6000 but added for 2019 is a new rt scat pack 1320 model an upgrade that costs 3995 thats specifically intended for grassroots drag racers 2019 dodge challenger rt scat pack 1320 angry bee fender badge the name plays off the fact that theres 1320 feet in a 14mile it comes with a host of features many previously fitted to the likewise dragoriented demon including nexen 20inch drag radials adaptive dampening suspension with drag mode transbrake torque reserve and heavyduty half shafts it also gets unique angry bee badges similar to the returning bee badges found on other scat pack models the 1320 comes only in narrow body form for better highspeed aerodynamics with the 8speed automatic furthermore it comes standard with just a driver seat which dodge says cuts 114 lbs off the total though a front passenger seat and rear seat can be added for 1 each as was the case with the demon dodge claims these modifications cut about 3 seconds from both the 060 and 14mile times standard interior configuration of the 2019 dodge challenger rt scat pack 1320 has drivers seat only to help reduce weight by approximately 114 pounds front passenger seat and rear seat are available individually as 1 options future collectibles 20172018 chevrolet camaro zl1 the base model rt scat pack is an allaround performer with the 64liter v8 providing strong linear power we drove both manual and automatictransmission versions of widebody variants and both impressed the manual has a slick shifter and easytomodulate clutch while the automatic kicked down quickly when the throttle was stabbed at speed for great passing response from there one can fork to either the acceleration or handling branch of the performance spectrum the 1320 is aimed at providing optimal offtheline grip and acceleration for drag racing while the widebody versions lean toward higher cornering capability indeed we drove the widebodys on a racetrack club motorsports in beautiful tamworth nh and found the car to be very grippy and balanced at speed yet it also rode quite comfortably on the ride up there so these are very capable yet livable performance vehicles with enough passenger and cargo space and available amenities to make them suitable for everyday that also holds for the hellcat redeye widebodys we drove though their extra 312 horsepower and the extra weight needed to produce it makes for a decidedly more exciting experience in more ways than one although shrunk from 64 to 62 liters the hellcats engine adds a supercharger that boosts power in all speed ranges and unlike a turbocharger delivers it instantly and in very linear fashion but that means an engine that was very strong before now delivers brutal power at the touch of the throttle and particularly if you choose to turn off the various tractionaiding nannies that can lead you into some dicey situations indeed stories abound of hellcats being wrecked during their first day of ownership by people who didnt respect what 700 horses can do and how quickly they can 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye fender badge what all this means on the racetrack and curvy roads is that the hellcat redeye widebodys are touchier than the scat packs partly because they carry more weight over their front wheels added largely by the supercharger and its associated plumbing while also being able to apply more power to the rears that means corners have to be approached a bit more slowly and exited more carefully as simply flooring the throttle if the front wheels arent straight will send the back ones sideways in a notsograceful pirouette something several black curvy lines on corner exits illustrated but entering the speaking of horsepower its simply amazing that 60 grand will buy you 717 worth another 11 grand bringing 797 but for most folks paring the ante down by 20000 still nets you 485 and on the street that should be plenty enough for anyone which isnt to say i dont desperately want a redeye 2019 dodge challenger srt hellcat redeye widebody the quickest of the quick check out our sportyperformance car best buys follow rick on twitter 2019 dodge challenger hellcat

    "text": "home growing fencefriendly vines dos and donts growing fencefriendly vines dos and donts posted on july 17 2017 has your fence already been damaged by vegetation are you in the market for a new one if you live near west chester pa and the delaware valley youre in luck request a quote for professional fence installation a structure covered in vines is one of the most classic and beautiful features you can add to your backyard vines climbing a fence not only enhance aesthetic value but make your yard more private unfortunately vines can be as destructive as they are beautiful theyre resourceful plants that crawl up structures in order to soak up as much sun as they can and sometimes they hold on tight and bring the structure down you need to make sure your fence is suitable for vines and also that youve chosen a vine that wont cause damage so if your dreams dos and donts to consider before growing vines on your backyard fence vines that arent fencefriendly the types of vines that are most likely to be unfriendly to your fence and your outdoor living space are fastgrowing woody vines and invasive species of vines though many of these are beautiful such as hydrangea or english ivy they can destroy your fence and shouldnt even come near it woody vines some woody vines are favorites of gardeners for good reason many of them like wisteria or trumpet vine bloom with bright fragrant flowers that attract hummingbirds or butterflies however when these vines begin to spread over your wooden fences surface they hold excess moisture against the wood this opens the door for rot as well as fungus bugs and other hazards that can wreak havoc on your fence the wood part of the woody vines anatomy can also cause a problem the vines strong wooden roots can get between the slats of a wooden fence or into existing cracks and invasive species many a hapless homeowner has introduced a beautiful vine to their fence and a short time later they ended up fighting an ongoing war with a vine that turned out to be a member of an invasive species invasive species of vines are often related to native species like american bittersweets relative oriental bittersweet these unwelcome cousins of naturallyoccurring vines have been known to overtake entire geographic regions choking out ecosystems and individual gardens alike invasive species like chocolate vine english ivy wintercreeper and japanese honeysuckle pose a hazard not only to the environment but to the appearance of your all of the problems that come with growing woody vines on your fence the moisture and accompanying structural damage are compounded by invasive species tendencies to grow rapidly on every inch of available space this includes your fence lawn other plants and trees and even your house if left completely unchecked once they take hold of your yard its likely that the only way to get rid of an invasive species is with a series of controlled burns and applications of vinekilling chemicals both of which are likely to damage to the beloved plants and trees you actually want to fencefriendly vines the type of fence you own determines the type of vine you can safely grow on it even the gentlest vines hold moisture against the parts of your wooden fence they touch however aluminum and vinyl fences respond well to most types of vines since they are more durable and less vulnerable to environmental damage than wooden fences for wooden fences if you have a wooden fence most species of vines are likely to be treacherous to your fences longevity the rotting cracking twisting and other structural damage that vines can cause to your wooden fence mean that most species should be kept away the safest vines for wooden fences are annual herbaceous nonwoody vines these vines stems can wrap around your wooden fence but wont cause the types of structural damage that woody vines will you can guide these vines to grow around fence posts or along your fences upper support beams which will provide them with plenty of light while keeping them away from your fences more vulnerable slats though they should be removed at the end of the growing season annual vines like morning glory moonflower sweet pea and climbing nasturtium all work well with wooden fences these plants are airier than most woody vines which minimizes any moisture trapped between the plant and the fence these vines grow readily from seed and can reach lengths of 10 to 15 feet at the peak of the season they do not provide much privacy but they do produce flowers that are vibrant in color and sweet in fragrance brightening up your summer garden and attracting butterflies and birds gardeners who like to vary their planting from year to year will enjoy the opportunity to plant new herbaceous vines each growing season for vinyl fences vinyl fences which are made of hardy weatherresistant material can withstand almost anything so the structural concerns that wooden fence owners have about growing vines on their fences mostly do not apply to vinyl fences because of their durability vinyl fences are ideal for homeowners who want their climbing vines to enhance the privacy of their spaces coral honeysuckle or clematis are perennial vines that climb vinyl fences readily these plants provide a lot of coverage in a short period of time and they can usually span the height of your fence within a single growing season though even the strongmantype woody vines will have little structural effect on your vinyl fence the plant can still trap moisture against your fence and with moisture comes a whole host of organisms from algae to bugs thankfully algae growth on your vinyl fence is no big deal vinyl is a nonporous surface that does not permit staining making it easy to clean your vinyl fence bugs on the other hand could pose a problem the moisture delicious plant matter and tough structure of a bushy vine may seem like a courteous invitation for bugs looking to homestead placing the other members of your garden in danger make sure to check on what bugs if any are fans of your chosen vine and take the proper steps against bug infestation to keep the rest of your outdoor space safe for aluminum fences aluminum fences are perhaps the most readilybeautified of all fences their durability and openlattice framework provide an excellent foundation for a living fence wisteria climbing hydrangea rambling roses and other heavy strong woody vines that might overwhelm other fences are no match for aluminum which withstands moisture and resists rust even grapevines grow enthusiastically on aluminum fences these plants can provide full coverage within a few growing seasons adding intense color and aroma to your space the thorny stalks of some vines like bougainvillea might even further discourage intruders quick tips for growing vines visit a plant nursery taking cuttings of random pretty vines from wooded areas may leave you quickly rueing your decision and even your very existence if the vines turn out to be invasive plant nurseries do not frequently cultivate invasive species since theyre often banned from sale by state governments however even vines not considered invasive can overwhelm you and your garden nursery staff can provide you with a wealth of information about how you can ensure your chosen vine stays under control your vines have needs too carefully research your vines sunlight space and soil requirements while some vines are relatively lowmaintenance its often said that some vines sleep then creep then leap an apt descriptor of how it may take several growing seasons of work to help your vine reach its fullest potential consider your alternatives if you have a wooden fence but are deadset on filling your garden with climbing hydrangea or wisteria look into other methods of introducing these plants into your space without destroying your fence arbors and trellises often provide a good structure for flowering vines to cling to and allow you to keep your vines growth in check strategically placing these structures can also help you enhance privacy many people place a series of posts a few feet inside their fence line and a string wire or other supports between each post then guide their vines along these wires doing so categories fences",

microorganisms research all us universities education and training doctoral degree median54840 per year employment outlook good definition and nature of the work microbiologists are biological scientists who study organisms so small that generally they can only be seen with a microscope these microorganisms include bacteria algae yeasts fungi protozoa viruses and other microscopic forms of life microbiologists isolate and make cultures of microorganisms identify their characteristics and observe their reactions to chemicals and other kinds of stimuli they also study how microorganisms develop and reproduce as well as their distribution in nature many microbiologists work for universities where they teach and do research others work at medical centers or in private industry some work for government agencies although their jobs have different aspects and responsibilities most microbiologists do some research or laboratory work they use special equipment to study microorganisms including light microscopes electron microscopes centrifuges glass tubes slides and computers they are often assisted by biological technicians microbiology is a broad field that includes the study of viruses as well as microscopic organisms found in all kingdoms of life plants animals protists fungi and bacteria some microbiologists specialize in one type of microorganism for example bacteriologists concentrate on bacteria and virologists study viruses microbiologists work in several areas many do basic research to increase knowledge about the life processes common to microbes their work helps to answer basic questions such as those pertaining to the use of food and oxygen in cells other microbiologists are employed in medicine medical microbiologists study the relationship between microorganisms and disease they isolate and identify diseaseproducing organisms and study their distribution they also study the ways that the organisms enter the bodies of humans and animals establish themselves and cause disease immunologists for example study the bodys defensive responses to microorganisms other medical microbiologists study the microbiologists study microscopic forms of life such as bacteria algae yeast fungi protozoa and viruses cdcphilcorbis effects of antibiotics on bacteria some are concerned with the role of viruses in cancer others help to develop new ways to treat and prevent disease microbiologists are also employed in the related field of public health they work to combat problems such as outbreaks of epidemics food poisoning and the pollution of air and water for example public health microbiologists test blood samples sent in by physicians to see whether patients have a communicable disease they also test drinking water milk supplies and other substances that can affect the health of the general public other fields in which microbiologists work include agriculture marine microbiology and industry agricultural microbiologists study the microorganisms found in soil and their effects on plant growth marine microbiologists seek ways to control the growth of harmful bacteria in oceans and rivers industrial microbiologists work in a variety of industries including food processing chemicals and drugs they may work to control the activities of microorganisms in such processes as the tanning of leather and the fermentation of wine education and training requirements you generally need a doctoral degree to become a microbiologist you can major in microbiology or any of the other biological sciences as an undergraduate although those who have bachelors degrees can find jobs in the field they are technicians and their opportunities for advancement are limited they are usually assigned such tasks as doing diagnostic or quality control testing in laboratories or in industry those who have earned masters degrees in microbiology or in related fields such as bacteriology are qualified for many jobs in industry teaching and applied research you need a doctoral degree to obtain most teaching a combination of academic courses and laboratory experience is required for a clinical laboratory license which is a prerequisite for admission to the certification examinations for some state departments of health many employers encourage and assist microbiologists who want to further their education in this field in order to keep up with new findings in their field microbiologists must continue studying throughout their careers getting the job your college instructors or placement office may be able to help you find a job in the field of microbiology some companies send recruiters to college job fairs you may find job openings in newspaper classifieds job banks on the internet or professional journals you can also apply directly to colleges and universities medical centers private firms and government agencies that hire microbiologists you may need to pass a civil service examination to get a government job advancement possibilities and employment outlook there are many possible avenues of advancement for microbiologists especially for those with a doctoral degree microbiologists can become directors of research in medical centers private firms or government agencies those who hold a teaching and research position in a university can advance to the rank of full professor they can also make significant discoveries in their research and gain the recognition of other microbiologists many scientists consider this to be the highest form of advancement the number of job opportunities for microbiologists will increase at a rate as fast as the average for all occupations through the year 2014 however the federal government has recently increased its budget and increased the number of grants awarded to researchers at the same time the number of advanced degrees awarded has continued to increase as a result there will be considerable competition for research positions colleges and universities will add only a few positions each year nonetheless increased public awareness in preserving the environment providing sanitary food production and storage and finding cures for such diseases as aids opportunities for those with bachelors or masters degrees in microbiology are expected to be better than the opportunities for those with doctoral degrees these workers can fill jobs in sciencerelated sales and marketing and can take on technician roles some can become high school teachers working conditions working conditions for microbiologists vary most spend at least part of their time in clean welllighted laboratories some microbiologists have to collect samples of soil seawater and other substances that contain microorganisms some microbiologists spend part of their time in classrooms and offices the workweek for many microbiologists in medical centers and private industry is generally forty hours those who work in universities and other research centers may have more flexible hours but their workweeks generally total more than forty hours some overtime or shift work may be necessary when a project must be completed or when an experiment must microbiologists must take precautions to prevent specimens from being contaminated and to keep harmful microorganisms from reproducing uncontrollably they should have skill in scientific experimentation and mathematics and be willing to do the precise detailed work required in microbiology microbiologists should be able to work either independently or as part of a team they must be able to keep careful

unless im charging a little bit for it im a freelancer every time i update crp it eats into my billable hours on the other hand i kind of love that crp is a free resource for casual learners my favorite thing about the internet is that it represents so much collective good will you ever heard that term cognitive surplus neither had i until i watched this rad talk by professor clay shirky in it shirky basically defines cognitive surplus as the way we use our mental downtime look at wikipedia right most of the contributors to wikipedia are volunteers they use their mental downtime their cognitive surplus to edit articles about like the lifecycle of jellyfish and the population of singapore they get nothing tangible out of this so why do they do it what is the root of that compulsion

    "text": "ancient mesopotamia this history our history httpmesopotamialibuch icagoedu university of chicago oriental institute museum printerfriendly version reviewed by nancy l stockdale university of north texas october 2006 this website is a treasure trove of information and imagery beautifully presented and expertly organized established to guide educators in presenting clearlyconceived and meaningful information about ancient mesopotamia the project is successful in making relevant connections between the ancients and our own world for the sites designers consciously remind visitors that ancient mesopotamia is modern iraq the site presents four sections a fine collection of teaching materials including 16 full lesson plans a learning collection of 142 artifacts and photographs of archeological sites an interactives section that presents interviews with three archeologists and detailed analyses of 13 artifacts and a section entitled life in mesopotamia presenting details on 14 topics surrounding daily life in ancient mesopotamia all of these areas provide vital materials that will help students and educators alike in studying the lives of everyday people in ancient iraq a central theme of the site presented most prominently in the section devoted to everyday life is the connection between the innovative inventions of mesopotamians and their essential role in creating key features of civilization still central to our world today mesopotamian inventions such as largescale agriculture urbanization centralized government and writing are taken for granted by students however by learning the history of these and many other innovations that made civilization possible students walk away with a more welldefined notion of how the study of ancient history relates to their own societies such linkages between the past and the present are always a welcome aspect in any presentation of remote history and in this case are doubly welcome because they provide a proud and important history of iraq that may counter the violent images students gain from media coverage of the nowwartorn nation fourteen topics are explored in depth in the life in mesopotamia section including religion the first farmers the role of women and the invention of writing each topic is presented with an introductory essay a variety of images and artifacts from the oriental institutes collection and links to lesson plans and related classroom activities these plans are provided in easytouse pdf formatted files and include contact information for experts at the chicago historical society although it may be that only teachers in the chicago area may take full advantage of field trip information educators everywhere may utilize these online resources giving the oriental institute far greater reach than possible prior to the internet another fantastic element of this website that brings the museum experience a bit closer to the computersavvy classroom is the interactives section to use this section educators and students must have shockwave flash and quicktime plugins installed on their computers by doing so they have access to a wide range of interviews with the oriental institutes director its conservator and prominent assyriologist dr martha roth topics include the significance of the code of hammurabi and a comparison between its laws and the laws of modern societies the methods museum curators use to preserve and display ancient artifacts and the reallife application of archeological pursuits in reference to ancient mesopotamian sites such as lamassu there are 13 interactive artifact explorations as well for example an ancient pull toy allows website visitors to explore the usages of childrens toys in mesopotamia in ways that simulate their original usage an invaluable tool for making the artifact come alive for modern students teachers of world history will definitely appreciate the learning collection unit of the website the 142 artifacts and photographs of archeological sites have been expertly presented crossreferenced and explained for educators and students to easily access and study visitors may search by name or browse the collection by the material used the type of object the time period cultural themes or the location where the object in question was found for instance a search for clay tablet calls up 76 results including cuneiform tablets and stellae various pieces of pottery childrens toys school homework assignments and religious figurines all made from clay each object is then accessible by zoomable photos crossreferenced to related artifacts pinpointed on a map revealing the location of its discovery and presented alongside suggested supplementary reading discussion questions are also provided allowing teachers to use readymade inquiries to get students engaged in class conversations these questions could also be useful as homework assignments finally the site presents a fantastic teaching materials section with clear directions on how to use the resources teachers may choose from 16 wellconceived lesson plans that inspire maximum usage of the resources on the site the lesson plans also provide fine assignments for inside and outside the classroom such as having students write about their opinions regarding the greatest contributions of the mesopotamians to our worlds heritage helping students do research on the way mesopotamian innovations compare with modern ones such as ancient and modern brain surgery record keeping and the status of women in society and watching films that boldly illustrate mesopotamian life such as the the glassmakers of herat one of the most relevant lesson plans for the purpose of the site that is linking the history of ancient mesopotamia to the modern world is a symbols from history assignment that prompts students to research the use of ancient symbols in modern iraq using newspapers articles library visits and the internet such assignments not only assist student learning about the ancient past but heighten awareness about current events as well finally a detailed list of how each lesson plan synchronizes with the national council for the social studies curriculum standards is a welcome addition for k12 educators this website is a welcome addition for scholars educators and students of world history the interactive archeological dig and enhanced flash presentations on ancient sites in iraq make this site especially useful as a teaching tool by providing visual written and interactive information about ancient mesopotamia and modern iraq as well as making the linkages between the ancient past and contemporary life the designers of this website have given world history educators a fantastic gift that will surely be appreciated and copied",

    "text": "in buildings army resources clan castle comments 423 share the clan castle houses your treasury and any reinforcement troops or spells sent by your clanmates ruin level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 level 5 level 6 level 7 level 8 summary a clan castle is needed for creating or joining a clan it houses troops which can either be placed as reinforcements during an attack or used as defenders when the players base is under attack players begin the game with a ruined clan castle while it is in ruins it is surrounded by obstacles plants and stones and can not be moved rebuilding a clan castle requires 10000 gold but does not require a free builder and its reconstruction happens instantly once it is rebuilt players are able to create a clan or join an existing one the clan castle can also be moved once it is rebuilt you do not need to join a clan first or remove any surrounding obstacles once players join a clan they have the ability to request once every 20 minutes or faster if the clan has a donation request wait time perk or if they bypass this wait time by using gems also players can add a message to tell other players what troops they would like other clan members will see the request in the clan chat and can donate a certain number of troops spells or siege machines to the clan castle depending on the clan level and the players clan castle level starting at level 4 players can request for one housing spaces worth of spells from their clan mates level 7 clan castles or higher allows them to hold two housing space worth of spells starting at level 6 players can request for siege machines from their clan mates players can use clan castle reinforcements during battle and any troops housed inside the clan castle can defend the players village whenever heshe is offline players can choose to toggle the defense status of defending clan castle troops to either guard mode or sleep mode in guard mode troops housed inside will defend the players village from attacks whilst in sleep mode troops housed inside will not do so the latter mode can be useful to save clan castle troops for attacking especially in clan wars players receive experience points for each troop they donate 1 experience point is earned for every housing space of troops donated for example donating 1 archer earns 1 experience point whereas a giant will earn 5 experience points and a dragon 20 experience points players can normally donate a maximum of 5 troops per request though up to 8 can be donated in a higher level clan with the donation limit perk every housing unit of troops donated counts towards the friend in need achievement players receive 5 experience for each housing space of spells donated so each dark spell or freeze spell yields 5 experience while 10 experience is gained for each 2space elixir spell donated each spell donated will count towards the sharing is caring achievement only one spell can be donated to each request at a time and this is independent of clan perks this is regardless of whether or not that one spell takes up 1 or 2 housing space players receive 30 experience for each siege machine donated the clan castle is home to the treasury which receives loot earned from star bonuses clan wars and clan games this replaces the previous war loot storage space and is not dependent on the actual level of the clan castle itself attackers can only steal a very small percentage 3 of the loot stored within the treasury defensive strategy the clan castle troops are very important up in higher leagues this is because they can distract and possibly kill attacking troops reducing the attacking army size and wasting precious seconds if your clan castle is in guard mode and enemy troops come within a 12tile radius of your clan castle any troops donated by your clanmates will file out to attack while defending troops from your clan castle are able to jump over walls this is also true for heroes when the clan castle is selected the activation radius can be seen like the range of a defense it is the only building other than defenses and hero altars that demonstrates this behavior if the clan castle is destroyed when defending any troops remaining inside will not be able to deploy until it regenerates completely although they are perfectly safe and will remain there until the next battle this can happen when only air troops are used to destroy it and some or all of the troops inside can only target ground troops and thus will not deploy try to place the clan castle somewhere near the center of the village so that the troops within will respond to attacks quickly from any direction this will also make the clan castle hard to trigger allowing the reinforcements to maximize damage inflicted on attacking troops keep in mind that once enemy troops that have no favorite target become aware of defending clan castle troops they will target those clan castle troops before they target any buildings this urge will even prompt them to break through a wall if necessary to get to the defending troops as such placement of a clan castle full of archers behind an interior wall will force attacking troops to break the walls before attacking surrounding buildings whether this is desired or not this building has a lot of hitpoints generally third only to the town hall and eagle artillery making it a very good building for absorbing damage while your defenses attack although the clan castle is a very useful building for defensive purposes troops which target defenses giants hog riders balloons and golems will not attack it or any of its defensive troops unless all of the defenses in the base have been destroyed defensive units that survive an attack regardless of their health level will return to the clan castle at full health if deployed offensively they will need to be replaced regardless of whether they survive or not if a base gets attacked by air units only the troops that can attack air units archers wizards dragons baby dragons minions and witches in that order will come and defend all other troops will stay inside the clan castle until ground units are deployed archers are great entry level clan castle troops as they offer a substantial defense against both air and ground troops for little cost their primary advantage is their ability to shoot from behind walls however an attacker with a poison spell will be able to quickly kill them dragons are a very commonly used clan castle troop at town hall level 7 and above especially in clan wars they are resistant to single poison spells and do high splash damage against both ground and air troops however they have come to be expected by many players who will likely have a strategy to eliminate them offensive strategy it is crucial to try to lure the troops out of the defending clan castle when attacking players can do this by deploying a single unit within the range of the enemys clan castle this is to prevent a situation where players are forced to fight these troops within range of the enemys defenses its also useful to know what type of defending troops are in the clan castle before deploying the whole army eg you dont want to deploy mass barbarians when the enemy has balloons defending his base if you can not reach the castles radius from the outside of the base then use 12 hog riders as they can get closer by jumping over walls once the enemy troops are fully lured out if your luring troops die before all enemy units are deployed you will need another lure then take them out with a lightning spell or poison spell or lure them out further and dispatch them with whatever troops you have after luring the troops out a player can choose to surrender the battle if you decide these troops put you in a disadvantageous position ignore them not recommended kill them with a lightning spell or poison spell or lure them farther away from the defensive buildings before battling them with your own troops note that once deployed clan castle troops no longer have a trigger radius and will travel the entire length of the map to attack any enemy units use this to your advantage to draw them as far away from the defensive buildings as possible an easy way of handling strong troops is to lure them far away from the base place one giant at a far side wait for the troops to come close and then deploy archers in a circle around them they should be taken down easily this technique also works on heroes although it is harder and heroes cant be lured far away from their trigger radius when weaker troops come out of a clan castle use a lightning spell or poison spell to get rid of them these two spells only damages defending troops not your own troops so you may use it while the defenders have engaged your attacking troops without fear of friendly fire another way to deal with a large number of weaker troops is to draw them out and deploy wizards if a lightning spell or poison spell is not available the wizard s high splash damage can oneshot entire groups of lowhealth troops remember that even if a clan castle has no clan shield it can still have troops in it from previous clans upgrade differences the clan castle undergoes significant visual changes when it is initially repaired level 1 and when it is upgraded to level 2 5 and 8 much of the detail of the top of the clan castle is obscured by your clan symbol once you create or join a clan however when it first appears it is ruined it looks like the top has collapsed or the building has been damaged by an explosion when you initially rebuild it to level 1 it appears as a square stone structure with sloped sides it is adorned with a single window two grey metal doors and a wooden roof at level 2 a battlemented platform is added to the wooden roof of the clan castle resembling that of a level 8 town hall a second window appears as well at level 3 four corners of the clan castle receive wooden supports and shields are added to each corner of the battlemented platform the small mat sized paths right next to the doors change to steel as well at level 4 the wooden supports are replaced with stone supports the wooden roof is opened revealing a ladder leading down inside the castle itself the exterior of the clan castle receives gold embellishment on the doors between the windows and on the shields at level 5 the clan castle is painted the same as the level 9 town hall the walls become vertical and the doors receive stone trim the ladder is now changed to grey steps and black shields are added to the corners of the castle at level 6 the clan castle still has the same greyblack coloring however the shields are changed to gold the roof is completely enclosed and the doors gain yellow stripes the roof is now fully closed once again at level 7 the clan castle retains its grayblack coloring but its doors are much larger plated with three golden stripes with the keyhole on the middle stripe the shields on the corners are changed being gold with grey borders and they are further reinforced with a golden stripe between these shields there is one golden ring resembling a door knocker for each wall at level 8 the clan castle takes on a new bluegray color scheme the giant goldplated doors are replaced with giant gray doors with dark gray edges with a golden keyhole in the middle the shields are now replaced with spiked corner guards with bolts in the middle between the corner guards and the bottom corners have been further reinforced the top of the clan castle is now blue with golden battlements trivia when clanmates donate troops they march into your clan castle from the clan path located on one edge of the clearing when you donate troops to your clanmates they march from your army camps to the clan path and disappear troops leave the clan castle in the order in which they were donated prior to the june 2017 update troops left the clan castle in the order barbarians archers goblins giants wall breakers balloons wizards healers dragons pekkas baby dragons miners minions hog riders valkyries golems witches lava hounds bowlers and also left from lowest to highest level donated troops walk through walls to get to your clan castle rather than jumping over them except air troops when the winter 2012 update came supercell had to raise the hitpoints of the clan castle because people were destroying it with the santas surprise spell before it could deploy any troops if a rebuilt clan castle is destroyed in a raid it will exactly resemble the original clan castle ruins the clan castle ruin is repairable at town hall level 3 through regular gameplay it is not available at earlier town hall levels even with gems as it is impossible to construct and upgrade gold storages to accommodate the needed amount until town hall level 3 however by using realworld money to purchase a resource pack at town hall level 2 which allows players to overfill their storages it is possible to obtain the necessary gold to rebuild the clan castle at town hall level 2 prior to the 16 september 2014 update you were not able to dismiss individual troops that you did not want instead you had to use them in an attack and possibly losing select troops you did prefer the full bubble will normally show if your clan castle is full of troops but it will not show if you are not in a clan while being upgraded the countdown timer for the next troop request will be hidden by the countdown timer for the upgrade the bubble shows treasury icon if your clan castle is full of resources the clan castle used to cost 40000 gold to rebuild later reduced to 10000 which made it much easier to rebuild at town hall 3 if the clan castle finished upgrading during

    "text": "painting by ivan shishkin how to write a pantoum with example the society september 19 2016 beauty for educators poetry poetry forms 12 comments by carol smallwood the pantoum is a poetry form that originated in 15th century malaysia and drifted west in the 19th century with french writer victor hugo among others while it never quite took off like the haiku it never fully went away either and has been steadily blossoming among english poets unlike the 14line sonnet pantoums do not have to be a certain length the challenge comes with the repetition of two lines from the first stanza in the following stanza additionally in the traditional pantoum form that i prefer the first line becomes the last line and the third line becomes the third from last the payoff of a well executed pantoum is a picturelike poem that seems to dance in circles outside the boundaries of time this is the format i use stanza 1 4 lines abab rhyme scheme stanza 2 line 5 repeat of line 2 in stanza 1 line 6 new line line 7 repeat of line 4 in stanza 1 line 8 new line stanza 3 last stanza this is the format for the last stanza regardless of how many preceding stanzas exist line 9 line 2 of the previous stanza line 10 line 3 of the first stanza line 11 line 4 of the previous stanza line 12 line 1 of the first stanza as with other formal poems one must not let the form drive the poem and select topics carefully like when goldilocks is looking for a bed in three bears house it must be just right other types of pantoums can be found here my example pantoum near the porch rails began when i noticed a red weed growing i hadnt seen before curious i looked at it closely and smiled as it seemed like beads and tried to find the name of it but couldnt online however names of others were delightful and decided to write about them as summer progressed near the porch rails new weeds bring surpriselike one with red beadlike leaves this spring nameless yet weeds were often used by ancestors for medicine or dye secure in ground in sun near the porch rails green life brings a new zing nearby white delicate queen annes lace wild carrot stretches to sky nameless yet weeds were often used by ancestors for medicine or dye calling one heal all is better than prunella vulgaris its scientific name nearby white delicate queen annes lace wild carrot stretches to sky even if families grow next to one another theyre never exactly the same calling one heal all is better than prunella vulgaris its scientific name mouseear chickweed bull thistle shepherds purse are common

zorneven tell the world genesis by liusaidh falun dafa hao by courtney dowe with audio 12 responses dusty grein september 19 2016 carol well done i too love to explore and use essays like this to teach others how to do the same my series of howto essays on classical forms are quite popular with my poetry groups the pantoum due to its strong cyclic repetition suits many subjects and i loved the way you spun a trip through the weeds into a nice circular web nothing thrills me quite like seeing different themes explored using classic metering and form i too prefer to create a crown from my pantoums and use the reverse of lines 1 3 from the first stanza as 2 4 in the final one i find that this refrain style reinforces that opening line and provides the best closure i have written several pantoums in this style as part of my new classic poetry collection and would love to share and get your opinion on a couple these two are both written in iambic pentameter since the subject matter in both cases was enhanced by the soft edges that iambs give and the cadence falls nicely into a repetitive form clouds clouds drift across the peaceful azure sky as i sit quietly under this tree i think of lifes big questions and i sigh i wonder if someday ill truly see as i sit quietly under this tree the sun is warm shining upon my face i wonder if someday ill truly see the beauty hidden deep inside this place the sun is warm shining upon my face i stretch out gladly soaking up the light the beauty hidden deep inside this place as arms of golden warmth embrace me tight i stretch out gladly soaking up the light i think of lifes big questions and i sigh as arms of golden warmth embrace me tight clouds drift across the peaceful azure sky dustygrein first kiss i floated home on clouds the day we met that first great kiss changed everything and more my life was full of havent done that yet id never tasted someones tongue before that first great kiss changed everything and more you taught me what it was to fall in love id never tasted someones tongue before but kissing for you just wasnt enough you taught me what it was to fall in love my virgin hands were unsure what to do but kissing for you just wasnt enough you made me want to learn the rest from you my virgin hands were unsure what to do my life was full of havent done that yet you made me want to learn the rest from you i floated home on clouds the day we met dustygrein carol smallwood september 21 2016 thank you for asking my opinion dusty i admire your skill with meter which i rather not tackle but hopefully will you sounded like you enjoyed writing them and hope you will continue and encouraged me to try meter again carol smallwood september 19 2016 thank you for the painting to accompany the poem classical art and formal poetry go well together and deserve more followers betty bellous september 19 2016 i am not a poet but these pantoums are delightful and so much fun to find the lines that are repeated in a subsequent verse thank you for introducing me to a form of poetry that i can enjoy carol smallwood september 21 2016 thank you betty for reading the pantoum i bet you could easily write one and enjoy share the results chris swanberg september 19 2016 carol your attention to history and structure in this piece is admirable thanks for sharing the interesting morphology and architecture of this unusual and very structured formal poetry interesting reading and food for future poems chris swanberg carol smallwood september 21 2016 thank you chris when i first looked at the format i never thought id try one but bit by bit it fall into place and now it is my favorite kind because it offers surprise at the end and not too much repetition of lines ive run across many that are written using different rules than those i gave modern versions perhaps you could say i started with villanelles but now pantoums are the most fun for me carole mertz september 19 2016 carol i liked your description of the pantoum as being outside the boundaries of time your example near the porch rails so well portrays the pantoums circular dance your listing of bull thistle after mouseear made me smile thanks for your clear explanation of the pantoums form sorry to tease out a pantoum from me in response would put me so far outside the boundaries of time thered be no return carol smallwood september 21 2016 thank you carole you caught the essential magic of the pantoum when you mentioned boundaries of time yes i used the names of the weeds you mention because they were funny and the scientific names made them sound so serious ive had to struggle getting the last stanza to work and ended up tossing the poems out sometimes adding another stanza worked lorna davis september 20 2016 carol thank you for taking the time to write this pantoums are new to me what an interesting form yes i love the way it circles back around and finishes neatly at its beginning dusty grein i especially love your clouds dusty grein september 20 2016 thank you lorna clouds was actually the first pantoum i ever wrote and is still one of my favorites as well it almost became the lead off poem in my forthcoming collection but was overridden by a terza rima that touched me deeply when i wrote it carol smallwood september 21 2016 thank you lorna for reading and sending a comment yes the circling back round is the challenging thing as often ive had to either add remove a stanza or two or toss the poem out when it made no sense this site uses akismet to reduce spam learn how your

is colorful despite what critics may say this section presents famous costa rican authors and their works read some national works it is highly recommended costa rican prose includes stories novels historical chronicles and essays surprisingly enough no indigenous texts have even been found or known to have existed from the early 1900s costa rican literature can be classified as realistic works from this period reflected the almost grim lifestyle in costa rica and how the population was insistent on seeking change the earliest prose from the 1930s and 1940s demonstrate a plea for social progress as its major underlying theme many of the vast majority of modern literature continues to draw strong influences from the local setting for example many writers decided to write about the plight and struggle of the banana plantations and the united fruit company even though the themes struggle between the classes has given way to a lighter more novel approach it still largely lacks mysticism and surrealism this is due to the lack of experience and meaning and the wisdom subtlety and romanticism costa rica is on of the only countries that can not compete with the best brazilian argentinean and colombian literature only julieta pinto came close when she wrote el eco de los pasos a striking novel about the 1948 civil war however after the civil war costa rica has remained a relatively peaceful country because of this costa rica has not had very many polemic struggles or severe social injustice in its history and tends to appreciate a higher standard of living many authors have had difficulty deriving inspiration and passion from real life experiences hence many of the literary works of costa rica focus more on lighter subject matters such as hope peace celebration and cooperation this lack of subject matter has also given costa rica the reputation for being limited in its prose this is not to say that the 1950s gave way to new trends in incorporating psychology into literature as a new element many writers took a deeper look into regional matters and day to day people then the 1970s and 1980s gave costa rica a reason to write again with the struggles of an economic crisis and mass unemployment to everyones surprise costa ricans unlike other latin american countries chose not to write about socialist ideals instead authors wanted

include virtudes escondidas 2003 pesares cotidianos 2004 resurrecciones 2005 and el guardian de los cuervos 2007 poetry costa rican poetry typically has followed the same literary movements as the majority of latin america due to strong influences from other countries just as costa ricans have in other forms of media poetry has been a form of expression in costa rica since colonial times the majority of experts would agree that poetry was born in costa rica in the 1890s around the same time costa rican literature began to really emerge in 1890 la lira costarricense was published and it was a poetic anthology that included authors like the following jose maria alfaro juan diego braun jenaro cardona aquileo echeverria carlos gagini and rafael machado additionally a few of these poets wrote several short stories novels and essays the undertone for the poetry written by these authors has romantic tones and modernist poetry advanced when an artistic magazine called repertorio americano 1919 was published some authors that participated with their creations were rafael angel troyo lisimaco chavarria and auristela castro de jimenez topics covered by these authors include such concepts as spiritualism and mysticism with the use of lavish language and detailed imagery castles fairies and parisian settings are common poetic themes of the modernist tendency in fact this detour into fantasy and luxury earned the authors a lot of criticism because they were accused of ignoring their surroundings most recently erotic poetry has emerged strong erotic poetry actually spread starting in the 1960s costa rica being a natural paradise allowed authors to draw inspiration from love intertwined with that of nature thus announcing that eroticism and sex were natural and glorifying them contemporary literature there is a lot of promise for what up and coming writers will do in costa rica since they have a wide range of topics they can cover at least on a national scale also more and more people have become open to careers in the arts and writing has become one of the most acceptable forms in which one can dedicate their lives work to in the past no one was willing to try and make a living off writing there are several contemporary authors who have written riveting pieces and actually won prizes many have been motivated by governmental contests and by la nacion newspaper who have recently invented new programs and prizes new authors realize that they can no longer simply imitate other peoples works that they actually need to expand and innovate to stay competitive in todays world however sadly with todays influences of pop culture many youth of today have strayed away from reading the classics and are more interested whats happening on tv or the latest video games costa ricans in general are not known for being very cultured or well read only the elite have this privilege print this",

    "text": "creating scaled borders for librecad the loudspeaker tieing both the electrical and mechanical together removing old glued down vinyl flooring the room after we were done with it this site is not about typical doityourself home remodeling but i just put a large amount of effort in doing just that and i think i have something to add so i will add it the room was in bad shape and our granddaughter will be living here every other week because of her dads work schedule so we decided to get the room ready for her some drywall work was necessary as well as painting and other typical work the problem was there was also some glued down vinyl flooring that was in bad shape that is the part when the house was built we had vinyl flooring put in for a couple of reasons first it is easy to maintain i have bad allergies and carpet was out of the question we do have a dog and dogs often have accidents so wood flooring was also a problem that pretty much left vinyl and vinyl for the replacement the house is built over a crawlspace and as such has wooden subfloors when the original vinyl was installed they installed 14 luan plywood over the subfloors as an underlayment for the vinyl at that time sheet vinyl flooring was glued to the plywood all in all the flooring has stood up well to a lot of abuse but beds with faulty legs and various other heavy things had wreaked havoc and created holes and tears in the flooring it was time to go like always when i face a job like this i look to see if i can find a better way to do it other than brute force i will link several of those videos here because my situation may not be the situation you face as always i will describe what worked for me and you may find a better way the old style vinyl consists of two parts first there is the vinyl part and then there was a fairly thick paper backing the paper and sometimes the vinyl is attached to the floor with some type of special removing the vinyl itself is going to require some kind of scraper and more than likely some brute force there are videos showing some kind of burner to burn the vinyl off i can not see doing this for several reasons first it would be impossible for me with the wood floors second burning pvc creates a very bad gas and it guarantees you will be sick third it will probably smoke up the rest of the house the other options i have seen are using a hand scraper a scraping attachment on an oscillating tool such as the dremel heat gun method how to remove old linoleum dremel method removing stubborn linoleum the easy way with the dremal hand scraping method how to scrape off linoleum flooring home improvement tips i chose primarily the hand scraping method with some of the dremel method to start lifting the vinyl i chose to score my flooring in about 2 x 2 squares that seemed to me to be an area i could handle and not continually having to start at an edge the following video shows me doing a particularly hard part of the floor for some reason the glue stuck extra tight there all of the tools i used are shown on my page tools scraping and cleaning once the vinyl layer was removed then came the really fun part removing the paper and glue at first i just used a scraper but it was very hard to not create gashes in the luan plywood underlayment eventually i went to using a steam iron to force the steam through the paper and weaken the glue i was concerned about what this would do to the plywood but the steam evaporated quickly and there was no detectable damage to the plywood i worked in small areas the size of a wash cloth and used a razor blade scraper instead the hot iron method removing gluempg this is what you dont want to do unless you cant avoid it the next picture shows some of the damage i did to the plywood this was the the part of the floor where the old vinyl seemed to be glued the best and this is also before i started using the steam iron i was able to fill the gashes so everything will be alright with the new floor there is another way all this can be done if i was going to a completely different type of flooring it would have been the only way that is to rip up the vinyl and the luan plywood at the same time scraping the paper before i started using the steam iron and razor scraper after all the paper and glue was removed it was necessary to fill in the floor this would have been necessary even if i had not created the gashes because there were dimples from the nails and the seams between the sheets of plywood repairing the gashes made this all the more important the type of vinyl i installed is sheet vinyl but it is very thick and has a fibreglass backing it can be left floating in other words not glued down however i had a minor problem during the installation day the weather was hot and the airconditioner came on i initially had not cut out the floor vent hole and the blower trapped air under the floor the waves were so great tt would just about make you seasick even after cutting the vent hole and installing the register enough air leaked under the flooring that i had some bubbles filling the floor so the vinyl was over a smooth surface all in all the project went well but it was very time consuming sheet vinyl was good for that floor because the room dimensions in one direction is less than 12 and 12 is the standard width for roll vinyl i have another room to do with much larger dimensions i am looking at a newer form of flooring for it called floating plank vinyl it will still mean having to remove the existing flooring because it is in very bad shape as always i hope you got something from this post although it is not typical of the types of posts i normally do gary removing old glued down vinyl flooring by createandmakecom is

    "text": "traveling student post 12 sep 2011 global business undergraduate 0 a few facts about santiago chile by nicole winjum foster undergraduate i have been working on this blog post for awhile making note of differences and simple facts of life i have seen while living in santiago chile its certainly not a complete list and i am sure im forgetting something but here are a few of the things ive noticed pda there is a lot of it and not just the handholding brief kiss on the lips kind im talking making out on the subway literally lying on top of each other in the park openly groping each other in the street kind in the united states pda is usually frowned upon and while you might see the occasional couple going at it those sightings are few and far between but not here if you are young and in love in santiago you are all for displaying that love for everybody to see seeing couples being so touchyfeely in public has dogs they are everywhere not only does just about every chilean family seem to own a dog or three but there is an abundance of street dogs with no apparent home you can always hear dogs barking at all hours of the day and night and everywhere you look there are dogs laying about in the sun and the truly surprising thing is that unlike the halfstarved mangy dogs in costa rica these dogs all seem to be fairly well fed streets nobody cleans them i mean not every street is covered in stuff but many are this was most noticeable in valparaiso but its true in santiago too the other day when i was riding the micro thats the bus system we passed by a street that looked like an entire farmers market worth of vegetables got thrown about it was crazy and it isnt just vegetables and pieces of plastic due to the abundance of dogs i mentioned earlier there is dog crap everywhere you have to constantly be on the lookout so you dont accidentally step in something gross bread eaten with every meal which is actually something i am quite thrilled with i love bread and due to my somewhat finicky eating habits it is often the only food i can eat while traveling to foreign countries but the chileans eat bread as often as the french its primarily sold in these funny little 4roll loaves see photo for breakfast you might have one or two rolls slathered in butter and jam with a cup of tea for lunch and dinner you may use a roll to clean your plate or as an appetizer for dessert a little bit smoking everybody does it im no stranger to smoking my mom smokes and i know a lot of people who might smoke a cigarette or two while drinking but most of the people i know back home really do not smoke which is not that surprising considering the ad campaigns and research studies we are inundated with telling us that smoking kills but here it is as if nobody is getting those messages i have heard about places like france having a lot of smokers but i just was not really expecting it here the most surprising is the number of lemons they love them seriously i never knew people could like lemons so much they put it on everything you ordered a salad squeeze some lemon juice on it youre eating some fish itll taste better with some lemon juice on it you want a snack just snack on a lemon i have literally seen people on the bus just sucking on a lemon with dinner every night we usually have a side salad which is iceberg lettuce with lemon juice oil and salt sometime we will have a carrot salad or a broccoli salad or a cauliflower salad which just a few other things to note the typical greeting is the onecheek kiss and it can get awkward if you go for the handshake and they go for your face they are big fans of avocado here which surprised me for some reason but i love avocado so its okay with me there is a sad lack of cheese here and the few types they have are pretty expensive i want to eat more or less like a local so it isnt so bad but i am definitely missing cheese names can get a bit confusing in my 25person marketing class there are 7 girls named maria this isnt the spanish you have been learning in class yes the words are more or less the same but their vocab is a little different and some phrases have different connotations they also speak very fast here and sometimes drop the s the youth say cachai after almost every sentence which basically means you know understand ciao is the customary goodbye around here i know i lot of countries use ciao as a goodbye but i still associate it with europe so it caught me a bit off guard chile exchange pontificia catolica south america undergrads go global",

and elaborate headgear all wizards are female contents show behavior wizards hover above lesser hive minions bombarding guardians with darkness blasts such attacks are wellaimed and difficult to dodge out in the open but because they are slowacting dodging by chance is made easier by observing their actions wizards can also summon a dark sphere of energy which is frequently done when their shield is taken down hive that stand within are healed but such energy is a poison to guardians it inflicts damage dulls your perception and slows you down wizards are protected by a solar shield when this shield is destroyed the wizard is vulnerable but their ability to levitate makes them nimble targets in the air they are also capable of a short teleport though they do not use it often on higher difficulty tiers a wizards basic darkness blast becomes faster and more deadly increasing their lethality wizards are intelligent unlike other enemies if the player draws their attention and damages them they will hide behind a wall to heal quickly they will also have another enemy protect them while they are healing up tactics wizards are dangerous opponents and it is best to dispatch them as swiftly as possible wizards hover around the battle zone while you are fighting other hive units healing them and pelting you with darkness blasts increasing the difficulty in terms of wasted time and efficiency wizards are a major annoyance heavy machine gun fire or sniper shots work well to quickly take them down a fusion rifle blast from medium range is quite effective too like all hive the head is the wizards weak point because they are nimble aerial units they are difficult to target with grenades or rockets unlike other hive units when targeting a wizard avoid using these weapons unless

photography relates to photography that is undertaken within a legal context for example providing an accurate visual record of an accident or crime scene in the process of aiding an investigation andor legal proceedings in court forensic photographers are called upon to photograph a wide range of subjects these include crime scenes gunshot wounds bitemarks weapons trace evidence autopsy procedures less obvious but equally important photographic protocols include taking pictures of mail and newspapers to help establish date of death and photographs taken from the perspective of witnesses at the time of the crime etc the following short documentary by david beazley takes a fascinating look at forensic photography through the eyes of nick marsh a forensic photographer of over

tutorial 1 a basic web application tutorial 2 different urls lead to different functions tutorial 3 my urls have parameters tutorial 4 submit this form tutorial 5 track my endusers activity tutorial 6

tutorial 11 organize my code dispatchers tools plugins tutorial 12 using pytest and code coverage pytest adding code coverage tutorial 1 a basic web application the following example demonstrates the most basic application you could write with cherrypy it starts a server and hosts an application that will be served at request reaching http1270018080 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import cherrypy class helloworld object cherrypyexpose def index self return hello world if __name__ __main__ cherrypy quickstart helloworld store this code snippet into a file named tut01py and execute it as follows python tut01py this will display something along the following 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 24feb2014210146 engine listening for sighup 24feb2014210146 engine listening for sigterm 24feb2014210146 engine listening for sigusr1 24feb2014210146 engine bus starting cherrypy checker the application mounted at has an empty config 24feb2014210146 engine started monitor thread autoreloader 24feb2014210146 engine serving on http1270018080 24feb2014210146 engine bus started this tells you several things the first three lines indicate the server will handle signal for you the next line tells you the current state of the server as that point it is in starting stage then you are notified your application has no specific configuration set to it next the server starts a couple of internal utilities that we will explain later finally the server indicates it is now ready to accept incoming communications as it listens on the address <phone> in other words at that stage your application is ready to be used before moving on lets discuss the message regarding the lack of configuration by default cherrypy has a feature which will review the syntax correctness of settings you could provide to configure the application when none are provided a warning message is thus displayed in the logs that log is harmless and will not prevent cherrypy from working you can refer to the documentation above to understand how to set the configuration tutorial 2 different urls lead to different functions your applications will obviously handle more than a single url lets imagine you have an application that generates a random string each time it is called 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator object cherrypyexpose def index self return hello world cherrypyexpose def generate self return random sample string hexdigits 8 if __name__ __main__ cherrypy quickstart stringgenerator save this into a file named tut02py and run it as follows python tut02py go now to httplocalhost8080generate and your browser will display a random string lets take a minute to decompose whats happening here this is the url that you have typed into your browser httplocalhost8080generate this url contains various parts http which roughly indicates its a url using the http protocol see rfc 2616 localhost8080 is the servers address its made of a hostname and a port generate which is the path segment of the url this is what cherrypy uses to locate an exposed function or method to respond here cherrypy uses the index method to handle and the generate method to handle generate tutorial 3 my urls have parameters in the previous tutorial we have seen how to create an application that could generate a random string lets now assume you wish to indicate the length of that string dynamically 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator object cherrypyexpose def index self return hello world cherrypyexpose def generate self length 8 return random sample string hexdigits int length if __name__ __main__ cherrypy quickstart stringgenerator save this into a file named tut03py and run it as follows python tut03py go now to httplocalhost8080generatelength16 and your browser will display a generated string of length 16 notice how we benefit from pythons default arguments values to support urls such as httplocalhost8080generate still in a url such as this one the section after is called a querystring traditionally the querystring is used to contextualize the url by passing a set of key value pairs the format for those pairs is keyvalue each pair being separated by a character notice how we have to convert the given length value to an integer indeed values are sent out from the client to our server as strings much like cherrypy maps url path segments to exposed functions querystring keys are mapped to those exposed function parameters tutorial 4 submit this form cherrypy is a web framework upon which you build web applications the most traditional shape taken by applications is through an html userinterface speaking to your cherrypy server lets see how to handle html forms via the following example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator object cherrypyexpose def index self return html headhead body form methodget actiongenerate input typetext value8 namelength button typesubmitgive it nowbutton form body html cherrypyexpose def generate self length 8 return random sample string hexdigits int length if __name__ __main__ cherrypy quickstart stringgenerator save this into a file named tut04py and run it as follows python tut04py go now to httplocalhost8080 and your browser and this will display a simple input field to indicate the length of the string you want to generate notice that in this example the form uses the get method and when you pressed the button the form is sent using the same url as in the previous tutorial html forms also support the post method in that case the querystring is not appended to the url but it sent as the body of the clients request to the server however this would not change your applications exposed method because cherrypy handles both the same way and uses the exposeds handler parameters to deal with the querystring key value pairs tutorial 5 track my endusers activity its not uncommon that an application needs to follow the users activity for a while the usual mechanism is to use a session identifier that is carried during the conversation between the user and your application 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 import random import string import cherrypy class stringgenerator object cherrypyexpose def index self return html headhead body form methodget actiongenerate input typetext value8 namelength button typesubmitgive it nowbutton form body html cherrypyexpose def generate self length 8 some_string random sample string hexdigits int length cherrypy session mystring some_string return some_string cherrypyexpose def display self return cherrypy session mystring if __name__ __main__ conf toolssessionson true cherrypy quickstart stringgenerator conf save this into a file named tut05py and run it as follows python tut05py in this example we generate the string as in the previous tutorial but also store it in the current session if you go to httplocalhost8080 generate a random string then go to httplocalhost8080display you will see the string you just generated the lines 3034 show you how to enable the session support in your cherrypy application by default cherrypy will save sessions in the processs memory it supports more persistent backends as well tutorial 6 what about my javascripts css and images web applications are usually also made of static content such as javascript css files or images cherrypy provides support to serve static content to endusers lets assume you want to associate a stylesheet with your application to display a blue background color why not first save the following stylesheet into a file named stylecss and stored into a local directory publiccss 1 2 3 body backgroundcolor blue now lets update the html code so that we link to the stylesheet using the httplocalhost8080staticcssstylecss url 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42

os path abspath os getcwd static toolsstaticdiron true toolsstaticdirdir public cherrypy quickstart stringgenerator conf save this into a file named tut06py and run it as follows python tut06py going to httplocalhost8080 you should be greeted by a flashy blue color cherrypy provides support to serve a single file or a complete directory structure most of the time this is what youll end up doing so this is what the code above demonstrates first we indicate the root directory of all of our static content this must be an absolute path for security reason cherrypy will complain if you provide only relative paths when looking for a match to your urls then we indicate that all urls which path segment starts with static will be served as static content we map that url to the public directory a direct child of the root directory the entire subtree of the public directory will be served as static content cherrypy will map urls to path within that directory this is why staticcssstylecss is found in publiccssstylecss tutorial 7 give us a rest its not unusual nowadays that web applications expose some sort of datamodel or computation functions without going into its details one strategy is to follow the rest principles edicted by roy t fielding roughly speaking it assumes that you can identify a resource and that you can address that resource through that identifier what for you may ask well mostly these principles are there to ensure that you decouple as best as you can the entities your application expose from the way they are manipulated or consumed to embrace this point of view developers will usually design a web api that expose pairs of url http method data constraints note you will often hear rest and web api together the former is one strategy to provide the latter this tutorial will not go deeper in that whole web api concept as its a much more engaging subject but you ought to read more about it online lets go through a small example of a very basic web api mildly following rest principles 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 import random import string import cherrypy cherrypyexpose class

requestdispatch cherrypy dispatch methoddispatcher toolssessionson true toolsresponse_headerson true toolsresponse_headersheaders contenttype textplain cherrypy quickstart stringgeneratorwebservice conf save this into a file named tut07py and run it as follows python tut07py before we see it in action lets explain a few things until now cherrypy was creating a tree of exposed methods that were used to match urls in the case of our web api we want to stress the role played by the actual requests http methods so we created methods that are named after them and they are all exposed at once by decorating the class itself with cherrypyexpose however we must then switch from the default mechanism of matching urls to method for one that is aware of the whole http method shenanigan this is what goes on line 27 where we create a methoddispatcher instance then we force the responses contenttype to be textplain and we finally ensure that get requests will only be responded to clients that accept that contenttype by having a accept textplain header set in their request however we do this only for that http method as it wouldnt have much meaning on the other methods for the purpose of this tutorial we will be using a python client rather than your browser as we wouldnt be able to actually try our web api otherwise please install requests through the following command pip install requests then fire up a python terminal and try the following commands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import requests s requests session r s get http1270018080 r status_code 500 r s post http1270018080 r status_code r text 200 u04a92138 r s get http1270018080 r status_code r text 200 u04a92138 r s get http1270018080 headers accept applicationjson r status_code 406 r s put http1270018080 params another_string hello r s get http1270018080 r status_code r text 200 uhello r s delete http1270018080 r s get http1270018080 r status_code 500 the first and last 500 responses stem from the fact that in the first case we havent yet generated a string through post and on the latter case that it doesnt exist after weve deleted it lines 1214 show you how the application reacted when our client requested the generated string as a json format since we configured the web api to only support plain text it returns the appropriate http error code note we use the session interface of requests so that it takes care of carrying the session id stored in the request cookie in each subsequent request that is handy important its all about restful urls these days isnt it it is likely your url will be made of dynamic parts that you will not be able to match to page handlers for example library12book15 can not be directly handled by the default cherrypy dispatcher since the segments 12 and 15 will not be matched to any python callable this can be easily workaround with two handy cherrypy features explained in the advanced section tutorial 8 make it smoother with ajax in the recent years web applications have moved away from the simple pattern of html forms refresh the whole page this traditional scheme still works very well but users have become used to web applications that dont refresh the entire page broadly speaking web applications carry code performed clientside that can speak with the backend without having to refresh the whole page this tutorial will involve a little more code this time around first lets see our css stylesheet located in publiccssstylecss 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 body backgroundcolor blue thestring display none were adding a simple rule about the element that will display the generated string by default lets not show it up save the following html code into a file named indexhtml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 doctype html html head link href staticcssstylecss rel stylesheet script src

to replace it with your favourite tool the page is composed of simple html elements to get user input and display the generated string it also contains clientside code to talk to the backend api that

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 import os ospath import random import string import cherrypy

generate replace or delete the strings notice how the page isnt refreshed simply part of its content notice as well how your frontend converses with the backend using a straightfoward yet clean web service api that same api could easily be used by nonhtml clients tutorial 9 data is all my life until now all the generated strings were saved in the session which by default is stored in the process memory though you can persist sessions on disk or in a distributed memory store this is not the right way of keeping your data on the long run sessions are there to identify your user and carry as little amount of data as necessary for the operation carried by the user to store persist and query data you need a proper database server there exist many to choose from with various paradigm support relational postgresql sqlite mariadb firebird columnoriented hbase cassandra keystore redis memcached document oriented couchdb mongodb graphoriented neo4j lets focus on the relational ones since they are the most common and probably what you will want to learn first for the sake of reducing the number of dependencies for these tutorials we will go for the sqlite database which is directly supported by python our application will replace the storage of the generated string from the session to a sqlite database the application will have the same html code as tutorial 08 so lets simply focus on the application code itself 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57

subscribe stop cleanup_database webapp stringgenerator webapp generator stringgeneratorwebservice cherrypy quickstart webapp conf save this into a file named tut09py and run it as follows python tut09py lets first see how we create two functions that create and destroy the table within our database these functions are registered to the cherrypys server on lines 8586 so that they are called when the server starts and stops next notice how we replaced all the session code with calls to the database we use the session id to identify the users string within our database since the session will go away after a while its probably not the right approach a better idea would be to associate the users login or more resilient unique identifier for the sake of our demo this should do important in this example we must still set the session to a dummy value so that the session is not discarded on each request by cherrypy since we now use the database to store the generated string we simply store a dummy timestamp inside the session note unfortunately sqlite in python forbids us to share a connection between threads since cherrypy is a multithreaded server this would be an issue this is the reason why we open and close a connection to the database on each call this is clearly not really production friendly and it is probably advisable to either use a more capable database engine or a higher level library such as sqlalchemy to better support your applications needs tutorial 10 make it a modern singlepage application with reactjs in the recent years clientside singlepage applications spa have gradually eaten serverside generated content web applicationss lunch this tutorial demonstrates how to integrate with reactjs a javascript library for spa released by facebook in 2013 please refer to reactjs documentation to learn more about it to demonstrate it lets use the code from tutorial 09 however we will be replacing the html and javascript code first lets see how our html code has changed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 doctype html html head link href staticcssstylecss rel stylesheet script src httpscdnjscloudflarecomajaxlibsreact0133reactjs script script src

html basically we have removed the entire javascript code that was using jquery instead we load the reactjs library as well as a new local javascript module named genjs and located in the publicjs directory 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66

where we indicate that we want to render the html code of the stringgeneratorbox reactjs class inside the generator div when the page is rendered so is that component notice how it is also made of another component that renders the form itself this might be a little over the top for such a simple example but hopefully will get you started with reactjs in the process there is not much to say and hopefully the meaning of that code is rather clear the component has an internal state in which we store the current string as generatedmodified by the user when the user changes the content of the input boxes the state is updated on the client side then when a button is clicked that state is sent out to the backend server using the api endpoint and the appropriate action takes places then the state is updated and so is the view tutorial 11 organize my code cherrypy comes with a powerful architecture that helps you organizing your code in a way that should make it easier to maintain and more flexible several mechanisms are at your disposal this tutorial will focus on the three main ones dispatchers tools plugins in order to understand them lets imagine you are at a superstore you have several tills and people queuing for each of them those are your requests you have various sections with food and other stuff these are your data finally you have the superstore people and their daily tasks to make sure sections are always in order this is your backend in spite of being really simplistic this is not far from how your application behaves cherrypy helps you structure your application in a way that mirrors these highlevel ideas dispatchers coming back to the superstore example it is likely that you will want to perform operations based on the till have a till for baskets with less than ten items have a till for disabled people have a till for pregnant women have a till where you can only using the store card to support these usecases cherrypy provides a mechanism called a dispatcher a dispatcher is executed early during the request processing in order to determine which piece of code of your application will handle the incoming request or to continue on the store analogy a dispatcher will decide which till to lead a customer to tools lets assume your store has decided to operate a discount spree but only for a specific category of customers cherrypy will deal with such use case via a mechanism called a tool a tool is a piece of code that runs on a perrequest basis in order to perform additional work usually a tool is a simple python function that is executed at a given point during the process of the request by cherrypy plugins",

store their cluster configurations in their local serverconf files located under splunk_homeetcsystemlocal see the serverconf specification file for details on all available configuration attributes key information remember these key points while reading this topic the essential configuration occurs when you initialize each member during the deployment process search head clustering has a large number of configuration settings available with a few exceptions you should not change these settings from their initial or default values without guidance from splunk support you must maintain identical settings across all members except as noted when you do change a setting across all members you must restart all the members at approximately the same time initializationtime configurations you can set all essential configurations during the deployment process when you initialize each member these are the key configuration attributes that you can or must set for each cluster member during initialization the members uri see deploy a search head cluster the members replication port see deploy a search head cluster the clusters replication factor see choose the replication factor for the search head cluster the clusters security key see set a security key for the search head cluster the deployer location see point the cluster members to the deployer the clusters label see deploy a search head cluster caution it is strongly recommended that you set all these attributes during initialization and do not later change them see deploy a search head cluster postinitialization configuration changes the main configuration changes that you can safely perform on your own postinitialization are the ad hoc search settings there are two of these one for specifying whether a particular member should run ad hoc searches only and another for specifying whether the member currently functioning as the captain should run ad hoc searches only the captain will not assign scheduled searches to ad hoc members see configure a cluster member to run ad hoc searches only you can also temporarily switch to a static captain as a work around for disaster recovery see use static captain to recover from loss of majority caution do not edit the id attribute in the shclustering stanza the system sets it automatically this attribute must conform to the requirements for a valid guid set the search head cluster label you usually set the cluster label with the splunk init command when you deploy the cluster if you did not set it during deployment you can later set it for the cluster by running this command on any one member splunk edit shclusterconfig shcluster_label label you do not need to restart the member after setting the label note if you set the label on a cluster member you must also set it on the deployer see configure the deployer the shcluster_label parameter is useful for identifying the cluster in the monitoring console see set cluster labels in monitoring splunk enterprise maintain the same configuration settings across all members the serverconf attributes for search head clustering must have the same values across all members with these exceptions mgmt_uri adhoc_searchhead replication_portport if any configuration values other than these ones vary from member to member then the behavior of the cluster will change depending on which member is currently serving as captain you do not want that to occur configuration methods most of the configuration occurs during initial cluster deployment through the cli splunk init command to perform further configuration later you have two choices use the cli splunk edit shclusterconfig command edit the shclustering stanza in serverconf directly it is generally simpler to use the cli caution you must make the same configuration changes on all members and then restart them all at approximately the same time because of the importance of maintaining identical settings across all members do not use the splunk rollingrestart command to restart except when changing the captain_is_adhoc_searchhead attribute as described in configure a cluster member to run ad hoc searches only instead run the splunk restart command on each member configure search head clustering with the cli you can use the cli splunk edit shclusterconfig command to make edits to the shclustering stanza in serverconf specify each attribute and its configured value as a key value pair for example to edit the adhoc_searchhead attribute splunk edit shclusterconfig adhoc_searchhead true auth usernamepassword the cli confirms that the operation was successful and instructs you to restart splunkd note the following you can use this command to edit any attribute in the shclustering stanza except the disabled attribute which turns search head clustering on and off you can only use this command on a member that has already been initialized for initial configuration use splunk init shclusterconfig configure search head clustering by editing serverconf you can also change attributes by directly editing serverconf the search head clustering attributes are located in the

    "text": "the doubled die variety is one of the most popular die varieties for collectors because doubled dies are so popular there is a lot of information out there about these varieties and they are often seen for sale on internet auction sites such as ebay unfortunately not all of the information out there is correct a frequent misconception about doubled dies is that they are produced when coins are struck twice by the dies this is definitely not the case all us coins made for circulation are only struck once unless there is a mishap in the coining press even then the resulting error coins will not be doubled dies only proof coins are struck more than once with the number of times that they are struck depending on the alloy of the planchets that will be struck into coins but even here the number of times that a proof coin is struck will have the key to doubled dies lies in the name doubled die as we have seen coins are struck by steel rods that bear the design images for the coins that they will be striking these steel rods are called dies for a doubled die coin to be produced the doubled image must be on the die itself hence the term doubled die doubled dies occur when there are mishaps in making the dies that will be used to strike the coins on the how dies are made page of this website we saw that for most of the mints die making history the master design for a coin was transferred to a master hub in a reduction lathe these have recently been replaced by cnc computer numerical control milling machines but the principal is still the same the master hub is then used in a hubbing press to create master dies the master dies are used in a hubbing press to create working hubs and the working hubs are then used in a hubbing press to create working dies it is the working dies that are then used to strike the coins in the coining presses in the wexler die variety files we define doubled die doubling as doubling produced on hubs or dies as a result of a misalignment of the images on the hub and die at some point during the hubbing process a more accurate term would be hubbing doubling but the term doubled die is clearly fixed in our culture and here to stay the misalignment of the design images may have been when the master hub was squeezing an image onto a master die when a master die was squeezing an image onto a working hub or when a working hub doubled master hubs reduction lathe doubling doubled master dies doubled working hubs since the vast majority of doubled die varieties that are reported to us are on coins from doubled working dies that is where we will focus our attention here because of changes in mint technology for making hubs and dies the process of making a working die can be divided into two eras these would be the multiplesqueeze hubbing era and the singlesqueeze hubbing era prior to the use of singlesqueeze hubbing presses which could impress the complete design with a singlesqueeze hubbing the working dies were made in multiplesqueeze hubbing presses for the first hubbing a die blank was placed on the bottom of the hubbing chamber a working hub was locked into the top of the hubbing chamber directly above the die blank here we see the hubbing chamber of a multiplesqueeze hubbing press arrows point to the working hub which is locked into the top of the hubbing chamber a die blank with the coneshaped die face is positioned directly below the working hub this photo is courtesy of arnold margolis and error trends coin magazine when the press was activated the working hub was lowered into the die blank with hundreds of tons of pressure the multiplesqueeze hubbing presses did not allow a deep enough penetration into the working die to make a satisfactory impression in the working die with just one hubbing the working die had to be removed from the hubbing press and taken to an annealing oven where it was heat treated to relax the molecular structure and soften the working die so that it could receive another impression from the working hub this is an annealing oven that was in use at the philadelphia mint during a coin world sponsored tour of the philadelphia mint in 1998 when the annealing process was completed the working die was returned to the hubbing press to receive the next impression for the second and later hubbings the setup in the hubbing press was different than that used for the first hubbing the working die was positioned on the bottom of the hubbing chamber with the working hub sitting directly on top of it when activated the top of the hubbing chamber lowered and again squeezed the working hub into the working die this photo shows a working die bottom and a working hub top positioned in the hubbing press for the second hubbing if additional hubbings were needed the setup between the hub and die in the hubbing press was the same this photo is courtesy of arnold margolis and error trends coin magazine the hubbing and annealing processes were repeated until it was determined that a satisfactory image was on the working die for some of the larger denominations it may have taken as many as nine or ten hubbings to leave a satisfactory image on the working die since the working hub and working die were placed into the hubbing chamber manually there was the possibility that the working hub would not be placed on top of the working die accurately if there was any kind of misalignment of images between the working hub and the partially completed working die doubled images would appear on the working die wherever these misalignments occurred at this point a doubled die was born and if that doubled die was put into use to strike coins all coins struck by that die would show exactly the same doubling after the production of the famous 1955 lincoln cent die 1 doubled die variety with an extremely strong spread to the doubling the mint took measures to prevent such widespread doubled dies from ever happening again they placed lugs around the rim of the dies and hubs so that the images on the hub and partially completed working die would align properly when they were placed in the hubbing chamber these lugs were raised on the working die and they were depressed indentations on the working hub this photo illustrates a working hub that was created for the lincoln cent reverse if you look carefully you can see that the images on the face of the working hub are raised and look just like they will appear on the struck coins the arrows point to grooves along the edge of the hub the lugs on the working die will fit into these grooves to allow proper alignment of the working hub and the working die when more than one hubbing is needed to complete a satisfactory image on the hub or die being made this is a working die left for the reverse of the lincoln cent as it appears after being hubbed notice that the design is reversed from what you will see on the struck coins though difficult to see in the photo the design is depressed incuse in the working die arrows point to the raised areas lugs around the rim that align to the grooves of the working hub to the right of the working die we can see some more blank steel rods that can be used to make master dies working hubs or working dies in 1969 the mint modified the obverse design for the lincoln cent as a result of those changes they experienced difficulty in getting satisfactory impressions in the working dies to remedy the problem they removed the lugs from the hubs and dies to allow for deeper penetration of the hub into the die this did fix the problem and allowed the deeper penetration of the hub into the die but it opened up the possibility of doubled dies again being created with strong spreads it didnt take long for the consequences of this decision to be felt in 1969 a major doubled die was produced for the 1969s lincoln cents another major doubled die was produced for the 1970s lincoln cents several doubled dies found their way into production for the 1971 lincoln cents with two major varieties known for the 1971s proof cents the dam broke in 1972 and several doubled die varieties were produced for the lincoln cents from all three mints including a major doubled die for the obverse of the pmint cents during this period of time significant doubled dies over the years it has been found that different types of misalignments between the images on the hub and the images on the die could occur the various types of misalignments produced unique characteristics to the doubling found on the dies each identifiable type of misalignment of images produced one the classes of doubled die varieties all but one of the leading die variety attributers recognize eight distinct classes of doubled die varieties coppercoins also uses a class ix for doubled die varieties produced on the new singlesqueeze hubbing presses all of the other attributers feel that the doubled die for more information on the various classes of doubled die varieties you can click on the following links class i doubled dies class ii doubled dies class iii doubled dies class iv doubled dies class v doubled dies class vi doubled dies class vii doubled dies class viii doubled dies when the mint introduced the singlesqueeze hubbing presses on a trial basis around 1985 and then to produce working dies at denver and philadelphia in 1996 and 1997 it had hoped to eliminate doubling produced during the hubbing process unfortunately for the mint this did not result and minor doubled dies are actually being produced more frequently on the new singlesqueeze hubbing presses than they were on the older multiplesqueeze hubbing presses we believe that we know the reason for this in the older multiplesqueeze hubbing presses the hub was fixed to the top of the hubbing chamber for the first hubbing when it descended down into the face of the die it couldnt move as it made contact with the die as it was locked into the top of the hubbing chamber in the singlesqueeze hubbing presses the set up is different the die blank is placed into the well of a collar placed in the bottom of the hubbing chamber the hub is also placed into the well of the collar so that the face of the hub is resting on the conical point of the top of the die blank since the diameter of the well in the collar has to exceed the diameter of the die blank and the hub so that the die blank and hub can be inserted into and removed from the collar and so that since the hub is slightly tilted at the time the hubbing begins as it is pushed down into the collar well and into the die blank it will be forced into a more vertical alignment in the collar well if there is some resistance to the vertical realignment when the hubbing begins it may snap back into proper alignment at some point as the hubbing proceeds hubbing press operators have described a clunking sound that is heard when the hub snaps back into proper alignment when this happens there will be a misalignment between the image formed prior to the this is a photo of a singlesqueeze hubbing press in use at the philadelphia mint in 1998 the hubbing press operator is placing one of the collars into the hubbing press the die blank and working hub will be manually placed into the well of the collar prior to that start of the hubbing the working die will be inserted first with the coneshaped top pointing upward and the working hub will sit on top of it with the design resting on the tip of the working dies cone because of how these doubled dies are being produced the affected area tends to be the center of the die that is due to the fact that the point of the conical top of the die blank is the first contact point with the hub and it usually doesnt take very long into the hubbing for the hub to snap or move into a more proper vertical alignment while the entire obverse and reverse should always be examined carefully the most likely place to find doubling on dies produced on the singlesqueeze hubbing presses is at the center of the on october 1 2009 i had the privilege of having a telephone conversation with george shue senior advisor in manufacturing at the us mint during this conversation the 2009d washington dc quarter with a major doubled die reverse came up mr shue noted that the mint was aware of this doubled die error and how it occurred this particular doubled die resulted when a hubbing press operator stopped one of the singlesqueeze hubbing presses to realign the hub and die and then restarted the hubbing sequence in the process a rotational misalignment of images resulted mr shue further noted that the conversation further revealed that the mint was aware that even though it was contrary to policy hubbing press operators were taking it upon themselves to sometimes stop the singlesqueeze hubbing presses before the hubbing was completed to make adjustments and then restarting the press to complete the hubbing to prevent doubled dies like the major variety seen on the 2009d washington dc quarter from happening again the mint has installed locks on the hubbing presses now if a hubbing press operator stops the press before the hubbing is completed they will be unable to restart the press until a because of the manner in which the dies receive doubled images through the hubbing process it is important to realize that doubling seen on doubled dies will be seen as raised and rounded secondary images just like the normal images on the coin doubled letters will often show splits in the serifs of the letters whenever the letters have serifs if the letters have squared off corners those corners will often show strong notches the separation between the doubled design images is referred to as the spread of the doubling the spread of the doubling can be very wide or it can be extremely close the doubling seen here is on the 1972 lincoln cent doubled die variety that we have listed as 1972 1 wddo003 notice that the doubled images are raised and rounded just like the normal letters in the word god this doubling is on the word pluribus on the reverse of a 1962 jefferson nickel that we have listed as 1962 5 wddr041 note the strong split serifs at the tops and bottoms of most of the letters strong split serifs show at the top and bottom of the 2nd s in states also note the strong notches at the top corners of the t and e this doubling is on the reverse of a 1964 lincoln cent that we have listed as 1964 1 wddr001 for collectors just starting to collect doubled die varieties it is important to know that there are other forms of doubling that can be found on coins that are not the product of a doubled die these other forms of doubling may have ended up on the coin when it was struck in the coining press or it may appear on the dies themselves but not as a result of design transfer in the hubbing presses if you have already done so we strongly urge you to read the worthless doubling page on this website it explains how these other common forms of doubling are produced and illustrates them with comparisons to examples of genuine doubled dies so that you can learn to tell the difference between the worthless doubling and the genuine doubled dies to go to the worthless doubling page click here worthless doubling in the wexler doubled die files we also classify doubled die varieties as major very significant significant minor or very minor doubled die varieties the chief factors in determining which of these categories apply would be the amount of spread to the doubling andor the amount of doubling the two usually go handinhand but there are always exceptions sometimes dealer and collector acceptance of a variety also influences the category into which a doubled die will fall major doubled die varieties these are the big boys the two most important factors are the amount of doubling andor the strength to the spread of the doubling in a number of cases the doubling is actually visible to the naked eye the 1955 doubled die lincoln cent listed as obverse die 1 is without doubt a major doubled die variety it is the undisputed king of the lincoln cent doubled die varieties the images are very widely spread and almost all design details on the obverse show the doubling on the other hand the 1984 lincoln cent listed as obverse die 1 is and a large amount of doubling to be classified as a major doubled die variety this is the date on the king of the lincoln cent doubled dies it is the 1955 lincoln cent doubled die listed as obverse die 1 or 1955 1 wddo001 this is clearly a major doubled die variety the 2009d washington dc quarter with the doubled die listed as 2009d 25 dc wddr001 has been recognized in the hobby as a major doubled die variety while the entire reverse is not affected the doubled area at the center of the reverse is extremely strong very significant doubled die varieties these are varieties that come very close to being major doubled die varieties they typically have strong spreads to the doubling andor significant amounts of doubling they would make nice additions to any doubled die collection sometimes they are not classified as major doubled dies because they are overshadowed by another doubled die for the same date and denomination an example of this would be the 1972 lincoln cent doubled die listed as obverse die 2 on any other date this would be a major doubled die variety however because of the major obverse die 1 few consider obverse die this strong doubling is on the obverse of the 1972 lincoln cent doubled die variety listed as 1972 1 wddo002 on any other date this would probably be considered a major doubled die variety but because of the popularity of the even stronger obverse die 1 it is greatly overshadowed and considered to be a very significant doubled die variety the extra tree seen on the reverse of 2005p 25 mn wddr001 is bold and widely separated it has not been touted as a major doubled die variety but certainly qualifies as a very significant variety the bold extra finger seen on 2009 1 fy wddr006 certainly qualifies as a very significant doubled die variety significant doubled die varieties these doubled die varieties still have nice spreads andor significant amounts of doubling they should be relatively easy to spot when you know where to look for the doubling and are worthy of being included in most doubled die collections those who collect only the easy to see varieties may exclude these from their collections this is doubling on the obverse of 1972 1 wddo004 the spread of the doubling is much less than that seen on 1972 1 wddo002 but it is still considered to be significant doubling as it is relatively easy to see with low magnification the strong doubling on the right side of the target tree on the reverse of the minnesota state quarter doubled die reverse listed as 2005p 25 mn wddr003 qualifies as a significant doubled die variety in the wexler doubled die files this nicely doubled thumb on 2009 1 fy wddr016 qualifies as a significant doubled die variety even though it is not a large part of the design that was affected minor doubled die varieties these varieties tend to have very close spreads to the doubling andor somewhat limited amounts of doubling stronger magnification than 10x is often needed to pick up the doubling on these varieties unless you have a well trained eye the die hard doubled die collectors will seek these out but many collectors will most likely not pursue adding them to their collections this is 1956 5 wddr034 doubling shows as split serifs on the upper letters a close spread can also be seen on the r and b of pluribus this one would be classified as a minor doubled die variety while readily visible the doubling seen here on the underside of the thumb on 2009 1 fy wddr008 is considered to be a minor doubled die variety this is the minnesota state quarter doubled die variety that we have listed as 2005p 25 mn wddr021 the doubling on the lower right part of the target tree is considered to be a minor doubled die variety very minor doubled die varieties doubled dies in this category tend to show very little doubling often all that can be seen are some split serifs or some notched corners to some of the letters many of the lincoln cent doubled eyelid varieties fall into this category as well they may have relatively wide spreads but show only a very small doubled image usually high magnification is required and only the hardiest of doubled die collectors will go after these here we see a doubled eyelid variety on 1944s 1 wddo020 it is the only doubling on the obverse of the cent making it a very minor doubled die variety the small amount of doubling on the reverse of 2009 1 ec wddr009 puts this doubled die in the very minor category the small amount of doubling at the joint of the index finger puts this 2009 formative years 1 doubled die variety into the very minor doubled die category and values for it should reflect that ranking when it comes to the value of a doubled die variety rarity is certainly a major factor in determining value and you need to keep in mind the fact that the doubling is on the die that is striking the coins as long as that die is kept in use it will continue to strike coins with that doubling some of the major and very significant doubled die varieties were caught by mint coining press operators and removed from service these would have very low mintages that would contribute to their value however most if not all of the minor the average die life for lincoln cents is about one million coins so if a minor lincoln cent doubled die variety went undetected or ignored because it was deemed too minor and unimportant there most likely would be somewhere in the area of a million or more specimens available to collectors one must be careful not to pay over inflated prices for these varieties or to charge over inflated prices for them just because it is a doubled die variety it does not mean that it is scarce rare or valuable doubled die varieties listed in the wexler doubled die files are listed with numbers such as 1955d 1 wddo001 the first two items give the date mint and the denomination in this case we would be referring to a 1955 dmint cent the w in wddo refers to the fact that it is a listing in the wexler files the ddo in wddo indicates that it is an obverse doubled die variety the 001 at the end of the notation indicates that it is the first doubled die variety reported for the obverse of the 1955d lincoln cents the second obverse doubled die reported for the 1955d lincoln cents would be listed as 1955d 1 wddo002 doubled dies for sometimes a pr designation will be found in a doubled die listing such as 1955 1 pr wddo003 this indicates that the doubled die variety was found on the obverse of a 1955 proof coin and it was the third obverse doubled die reported for the 1955 lincoln cents likewise sf in a listing number will indicate that the coin has the satin finish found in the modern mint sets for some special series issued by the mint such as the statehood quarters an additional notation in the listing number will give more information about the coin that the doubled die can be found on in the case of the statehood quarters the postal abbreviations for the states are used in the listing numbers 2005p 25 mn wddo001 indicates that it is obverse die 1 for the 2005p minnesota state quarters in the presidential dollar series the listings include the initials of the president being honored on that coin a listing of 2008p 1 mvb wddr001 indicates reverse die 1 if you have coins that you suspect are doubled dies and would like to find out if they are indeed genuine doubled die varieties or if you know that they are doubled die varieties and would like to find out if they are listed in the wexler die variety files you can send them for attribution if you are sending coins the following guidelines must be followed 1 the fee for attributions depends on whether one side of the coin needs to be attributed or both sides need to be attributed if only one side needs to be attributed just one side has doubling the fee is 4 per coin if both sides need to be attributed both sides have doubling then the fee is 5 per coin return postage and insurance is extra and must be included with any coins that are sent the rule of thumb for return postage is that whatever it costs you for postage and insurance to send the coins to me thats 2 you may send up to but no more than 5 coins per shipment if packages are sent with more than 5 coins it will greatly delay their return five coins will be processed and the package then placed at the end of the mail line until it comes up again 3 do not send any additional shipments until the previous shipment has been returned 4 never send coins by certified mail if they are lost or stolen in the mail you will not be able to recover any of their value certified mail does not carry any insurance all coins should be sent by insured first class mail or by registered mail by far the safest way that anyone can send coins is by registered mail it is more expensive but it is the safest way to send them as the package must be signed for by every individual that touches it along the way if coins are sent by insured first class mail but an actual value can not be 5 if you would like to receive a notice that the coins arrived here safely you can take advantage of the delivery confirmation services available through the post office and also the return receipt services available from the post office 6 make sure that you package your coins very carefully if they can move about in the package they might be able to tear out of the package and become lost i recommend shipping in a padded mailer available from the post office walmart staples etc 7 please send your coins in plastic or vinyl flips from which they can easily be removed do not send the coins in 2x2s that have been stapled 8 we do not attribute foreign coin varieties only varieties on us coinage 9 once the coins arrive they will be processed as quickly as possible due to large demands on the attributers it may take anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks before the coins are processed and returned it is usually less than that but we do ask your patience once they are sent send all us doubled die varieties except 5 doubled dies to john a wexler po box 544 quakertown pa 189510544 email jwexcomcastnet send all us 5 doubled die varieties to brian ribar 2053 edith place merrick ny 115663306 email bribaroptonlinenet go to",

in samana bay whalewatching season in the dr starts 14 january and continues through 15 march sometimes the season extends itself through the end of march ken de pree dr1s whale expert reports on the arrival of the humpback whales and whalewatching season thousands of humpback whales from the north atlantic migrate to the waters of the dominican republic each winter to mate and give birth their most popular winter rendezvous is silver bank the 3000squarekilometer reef system approximately 70 miles north east of puerto plata but from there many circulate to other popular areas like humans do at singles bars one of these gathering places is samana bay more than 1500 humpbacks visit the bay with as many as 300 present at any given time during mating season the world wildlife fund considers samana bay one of the best places in the world to watch whales it offers something for everyonethe outer bay is where you might find aggressive males competing for the favors of willing females and the sheltered inner bay is one of the most important humpback nurseries in the world midjanuary to the end of march is the usual whalewatching season in samana bay however the excursions continue as long as enough whales remain the rest of the year the whales feed in the cold fishrich waters of the north atlantic between massachusetts bay and iceland and greenland summer whalewatching excursions are offered in those areas but there is no better time than the winter mating season when the male humpbacks eager to impress the females are most animated and when newborn calves can be seen swimming alongside their mothers humpback whales have been wintering near samana for centuries cave drawings made by the aboriginal inhabitants of los haitises national park long before columbus arrived depict the spouting whales and columbus saw them too as the log of his travels along the north coast in 1493 makes clear about humpback whales humpbacks are airbreathing mammals belonging to the group known as great whales adults measure 4050 ft1215 m and weigh 3040 tons babies measure 1015 ft345 m and weigh 152 tons when born they have little blubber fat to protect them from the cold water awaiting them in the north but grow quickly on the rich milk provided by their mother each day they drink 50 gallons of milk that is 5060 fat and gain 100 pounds much of which is blubber by comparison the milk of a human mother is 2 fat adult humpbacks are black or dark gray with white patches on the flippers the belly and the underside of the tail at first glance all look alike but there are differences the black and white pigmentation on the underside of the tail flukes is the most common means of distinguishing one from another no two have the same markings enabling whale scientists to identify humpbacks in the same way humans are by their fingerprints permanent scars dorsal fin shape and other unique markings also help distinguish one from another no whale species is more active than the humpback causing herman melville in moby dick to call them the most lighthearted and gamesome of all the whales and the breeding season is when they are the most animated among the behaviors that delight whale watchers are breaching whale builds momentum swimming underwater then launches itself into the air exposing some or all of its body before crashing back onto the waters surface flippering whale rolls on its side or back raises one or both flippers then slaps itthem against the surface rolling horizontal on the surface the whale rolls between 45 and 60 degrees perhaps slapping the water with its flippers surface active group two to 20 rowdy males compete aggressively to mate with a fertile female they may breach slam heads and bodies and even draw blood the humpback whale is also known for its haunting melody a variety of chirps yups grunts and eooooos that form a song jacques cousteau called them the carusos of the deep whales can hear the songs for up to 20 miles humans can eavesdrop with an underwater listening device called a hydrophone whalewatching excursions in samana bay whalewatching excursions can be booked from most hotels in samana or at the city dock area the boat trip and government fees to enter the whale sanctuary are included in the price and a meal the excursion can also be booked through a number of tour companies with offices located in all tourist areas traveling to samana on your own isnt difficult one option is to rent a car and drive to samana from puerto plata on the north coast about a four hour drive or if youre coming from the south coast santo domingo take advantage of the new toll road that will put you in samana in about two hours the alternative non toll road from santo domingo to san francisco de macoris nagua and sanchez samana takes about four hours another option is to drive to sabana de la mar and take a ferry across the bay to samana both routes bus travel to samana is another good alternative and much less expensive from the south coast caribe tours and metro offer daily bus service from santo domingo to samana from the north coast caribe tours has service from puerto plata and sosua the buses of both companies are large modern and airconditioned charter flights to samana can also be arranged from any airport and can fly into el catey arroyo barril best for samana city or portillo best for las terrenas once in samana there are many boats to choose from ranging from 23 yolas local fishing boats with no protection from weather or waves single gasoline outboard motor to fast launches largely uncovered inboard diesel engine or twin outboard motors to large twindiesel engine vessels capable of handling 5080 passengers bathroom protection from weather no matter how calm the inner bay looks from the dock the outer baywhere the whales usually areis often rough during the winter months so choice of boat is very important considerations include boat construction protection from the weather and windblown spray and height above sea level for visibility at the distances required by whalewatching regulations the three companies listed below are the recommended choices based on boat size type of engines services provided and adherence to the whalewatching regulations victoria marinewhale samana victoria ii 5080 passengers always a whale expert on board usually kim beddall founder of whale watching in samana bay excursions of 34 hours <phone> transporte maritimo minadiel several vessels all 5080 passengers occasionally a whale expert on board excursions of 34 hours <phone> moto marina fast launches excursions of 2 hours rarely a whale expert on board <phone> samana bay is a marine sanctuary by decree of the dominican government whale watching tours must by law protect the whales within this sanctuary among the rules are limits on the number of vessels that can observe a whale at the same time the minimum distance that must be maintained between vessels and whales unless a curious whale approaches the boat speed of travel through the whale area and the length of time a vessel may spend watching an individual whale additionally no vessel may permit passengers to swim with the whales because captains sometimes violate the regulations thinking their what else is going on in samana as explained above it is possible to make a day trip to see the whales if staying at another dominican destination but it is always best to overnight in samana and stay on to enjoy one or two other attractions of this province lodging is available in samana at a variety of hotels of varying sizes and degrees of luxury youll find hotels in the city of samana las galeras beach las terrenas portillo playa popy cozon and playa bonita

that they would have the power to become super saiyans and defeat him when bardock attempts to kill frieza with his final spirit cannon for the murder of his comrades because of friezas betrayal the tyrant counters with his supernova friezas supernova approaches planet vegeta the attack destroyed planet vegeta as well as the entire saiyan race and a large percentage of his own soldiers yet a few saiyans had survivedescaped the supernova also somehow sent bardock back in time to the time when chilled friezas ancestor ran the frieza force in the manga version of episode of bardock frieza and

    "text": "can a parent voluntarily relinquish parental rights in texas in texas there are two ways a parent can voluntarily relinquish parental rights one avenue for terminating parental rights is for the parents to sign an affidavit of relinquishment of parental rights an affidavit of voluntary relinquishment must contain some very specific information about the child the parents and the guardians of the child a statement that the parent relinquishing her rights has been informed about her parental rights and duties a statement that the affidavit is either irrevocable for a stated period of time or revocable and a statement that designates someone else as the managing conservator of the the signing of an affidavit of relinquishment of parental rights does not immediately terminate the parentchild relationship instead it provides a basis for the court to enter a judgment of termination the court must also find that termination is in the best interest of the child even with an affidavit relinquishing parental rights in order to terminate another avenue to waive parental rights is for a man to sign an affidavit waiving interest in the child an affidavit waiving interest is irrevocable and it can be signed before or after the childs birth this may be used when it is unclear whether or not a particular man is the father again the signing of the affidavit does not automatically terminate any parental rights but it can be used in termination proceedings in either situation it is advisable to have the affidavit prepared by an attorney to make sure all the paperwork meets all legal requirements termination of parental rights voluntarily relinquishment of parental rights waiver of interst you may also like who can file a child custody suit in texas by

    "text": "technology acceptance model navigation based on the theory of reasoned action davis 1986 developed the technology acceptance model which deals more specifically with the prediction of the acceptability of an information system the purpose of this model is to predict the acceptability of a tool and to identify the modifications which must be brought to the system in order to make it acceptable to users this model suggests that the acceptability of an information system is determined by two main factors perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use perceived usefulness is defined as being the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will improve his performance perceived ease of use refers to the degree to which a person believes that the use of a system will be effortless several factorial analyses demonstrated that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use can be considered as two different dimensions hauser et shugan 1980 larcker et lessig 1980 swanson 1987 as demonstrated in the theory of reasoned action the technology acceptance model postulates that the use of an information system is determined by the behavioral intention but on the other hand that the behavioral intention is determined by the persons attitude towards the use of the system and also by his perception of its utility according to davis the attitude of an individual is not the only factor that determines his use of a system but is also based on the impact which it may have on his performance therefore even if an employee does not welcome an information system technology acceptance model from davis bagozzi et warshaw 1989 according to davis 1986 perceived ease of use also influences in a significant way the attitude of an individual through two main mechanisms selfefficacy and instrumentality selfefficacy is a concept developed by bandura 1982 which explains that the more a system is easy to use the greater should be the users sense of efficacy moreover a tool that is easy to use will make the user feel that he has a control over what he is doing lepper on 1985 efficacy is one of the main factors underlying intrinsic motivation bandura on 1982 lepper on 1985 and it is what illustrates here the direct link between perceived ease of use and attitude perceived ease of use can also contribute in an instrumental way in improving a persons it is however interesting to note that the research presented by davis 1989 to validate his model demonstrates that the link between the intention to use an information system and perceived usefulness is stronger than perceived ease of use according to this model we can therefore expect that the factor which influences the most a user is the perceived usefulness of a tool although the intial tam model was empirically validated it explained only a fraction of the variance of the outcome variable it usage from 4 to 45 according to mcfarland and hamilton 2006 therefore many authors have refined the initial model trying to find the latent factors underlying perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in tam2 venkatesh davis 2000 showed that social influence processes subjective norm voluntarity image and cognitive instrumental processes job relevance output quality result demontrability affected perceived usefulness and intention to use a notable refinment of the tam model is proposed by mc farland and hamilton 2006 figure 2 adding contextual specificity to the technology acceptance model from mcfarland hamilton 2006 the results comforted the research model showing that system usage was directly and significantly affected by task structure prior experience others use organizational support anxiety and system quality mediation effect were also shown as predicted thus however for some relations the effect went in the opposite direction from expected like others use lowering computer efficacy or high quality systems linked to low frequency of use in sum the initial model or its extension does not completely accounts for the observed variance in system usage however the models all agree that computer efficacy affects perceived ease of use which in turns is strongly related to perceived usefulness see also theory of reasoned action theory of planned behaviour usability and user experience surveys references bandura a 1982 selfefficacy mechanism in human

in their original homeland of aldmeris according to this story orgnum was a massively rich aldmer nobleman who used his wealth to rebel against the governments and powers of aldmeris he and his followers were exilled from aldmeris to a place where they could not take such actions again via impenetrable mist pyandonea the veil of mist this proved successful as they never assaulted aldmeris again and became the maormer first second era the maormer were relentless in their drive to conquer summerset and there is scarcely a year throughout the first or second era when they did not ravage the coastlines of the altmer every attack launched by the maormer against summerset has been led by orgnum himself and despite the number of wars and strategies employed by the maormer each of these attacks has proved to be an ultimate failure in the year 2e 486 a small maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of alinor and king hidellith ordered his navy to give chase the navy followed the ships through uncharted waters into an ambush in pyandonea itself most of the alinori navy was destroyed but a single warship returned to summerset a testament to the maritime genius of the altmer during the three banners war in 2e 582 the maormer had some form of control over the elsweyr island khenarthis roost under a treaty they agreed to with the city of mistral ulondil the maormer ambassador of the island along with his followers later went on to betray the agreement the sea vipers a powerful faction of maormer was known to have also led attacks against the first aldmeri dominion throughout many of its controlled territories the second aldmeri dominion made allies of the maormer although the dominion allowed the kings of colovia to eliminate maormer outposts that had been established

    "text": "home networking lan switching firststep layer 2 switching methods lan switches are characterized by the forwarding method that they support such as a storeandforward switch cutthrough switch or fragmentfree switch in the storeandforward switching method error checking is performed against the frame and any frame with errors is discarded with the cutthrough switching method no error checking is performed against the frame which makes forwarding the frame through the switch faster than storeandforward switches storeandforward switching storeandforward switching means that the lan switch copies each complete frame into the switch memory buffers and computes a cyclic redundancy check crc for errors crc is an errorchecking method that uses a mathematical formula based on the number of bits 1s in the frame to determine whether the received frame is errored if a crc error is found the frame is discarded if the frame is error free the switch forwards the frame out the appropriate interface port as illustrated in figure 67 figure 67 storeandforward switch discarding a frame with a bad crc view full size image an ethernet frame is discarded if it is smaller than 64 bytes in length a runt or if the frame is larger than 1518 bytes in length a giant as illustrated in figure 68 figure 68 runts and giants in the switch view full size image note some switches can be configured to carry giant or jumbo frames if the frame does not contain any errors and is not a runt or a giant the lan switch looks up the destination address in its forwarding or switching table and determines the outgoing interface it then forwards the frame toward its intended destination storeandforward switching operation storeandforward switches store the entire frame in internal memory and check the frame for errors before forwarding the frame to its destination storeandforward switch operation ensures a high level of errorfree network traffic because bad data frames are discarded rather than forwarded across the network as illustrated in figure 69 figure 69 storeandforward switch examining each frame for errors before forwarding to destination network segment view full size image the storeandforward switch shown in figure 69 inspects each received frame for errors before forwarding it on to the frames destination network segment if a frame fails this inspection the switch drops the frame from its buffers and the frame is thrown in to the proverbial bit bucket a drawback to the storeandforward switching method is one of performance because the switch has to store the entire data frame before checking for errors and forwarding this error checking results in high switch latency delay if multiple switches are connected with the data being checked at each switch point total network performance can suffer as a result another drawback to storeandforward switching is that the switch requires more memory and processor central processing unit cpu cycles to perform the detailed inspection of each frame than that of cutthrough or fragmentfree switching cutthrough switching with cutthrough switching the lan switch copies into its memory only the destination mac address which is located in the first 6 bytes of the frame following the preamble the switch looks up the destination mac address in its switching table determines the outgoing interface port and forwards the frame on to its destination through the designated switch port a cutthrough switch reduces delay because the switch begins to forward the frame as soon as it reads the destination mac address and determines the outgoing switch port as illustrated in figure 610 figure 610 cutthrough switch examining each frame header before forwarding to destination network segment view full size image the cutthrough switch shown in figure 610 inspects each received frames header to determine the destination before forwarding on to the frames destination network segment frames with and without errors are forwarded in cutthrough switching operations leaving the error detection of the frame to the intended recipient if the receiving switch determines the frame is errored the frame is thrown out to the bit bucket where the frame is subsequently discarded from the network cutthrough switching was developed to reduce the delay in the switch processing frames as they arrive at the switch and are forwarded on to the destination switch port the switch pulls the frame header into its port buffer when the destination mac address is determined by the switch the switch forwards the frame out the correct interface port to the frames intended destination cutthrough switching reduces latency inside the switch if the frame was corrupted in transit however the switch still forwards the bad frame the destination receives this bad frame checks the frames crc and discards it forcing the source to resend the frame this process wastes bandwidth and if it occurs too often network users experience a significant slowdown on the network in contrast storeandforward switching prevents errored frames from being forwarded across the network and provides for quality of service qos managing network traffic flow note todays switches dont suffer the network latency that older legacy switches labored under this minimizes the effect switch latency has on your traffic todays switches are better suited for a storeandforward environment cutthrough switching operation cutthrough switches do not perform any error checking of the frame because the switch looks only for the frames destination mac address and forwards the frame out the appropriate switch port cutthrough switching results in low switch latency the drawback however is that bad data frames as well as good frames are sent to their destinations at first blush this might not sound bad because most network cards do their own frame checking by default to ensure good data is received you might find that if your network is broken down into workgroups the likelihood of bad frames or collisions fragmentfree switching fragmentfree switching is also known as runtless switching and is a hybrid of cutthrough and storeandforward switching fragmentfree switching was developed to solve the latecollision problem note recall that when two systems transmissions occur at the same time the result is a collision collisions are a part of ethernet communications and do not imply any error condition a late collision is similar to an ethernet collision except that it occurs after all hosts on the network should have been able to notice that a host was already transmitting a late collision indicates that another system attempted to transmit after a host has transmitted at least the first 60 bytes of its frame late collisions are often caused by an ethernet lan being too large and therefore needing to be segmented late collisions can also be caused by faulty network devices on the segment and duplex for example halfduplexfullduplex mismatches between connected devices fragmentfree switching operation fragmentfree switching works like cutthrough switching with the exception that a switch in fragmentfree mode stores the first 64 bytes of the frame before forwarding fragmentfree switching can be viewed as a compromise between storeandforward switching and cutthrough switching the reason fragmentfree switching stores only the first 64 bytes of the frame is that most network errors and collisions occur during the first 64 bytes of a frame note different methods work better at different points in the network for example cutthrough switching is best for the network core where errors are fewer and speed is of utmost importance storeandforward is best at the network access layer where most network problems and users are located layer 3 switching layer 3 switching is another example of fragmentfree switching up to now this discussion has concentrated on switching and bridging at the data link layer layer 2 of the open system interconnection osi model when bridge technology was first developed it was not practical to build wirespeed bridges with large numbers of highspeed ports because of the manufacturing cost involved with improved technology many functions previously implemented in software were moved into the hardware increasing performance and enabling manufacturers to build reasonably priced wirespeed switches whereas bridges and switches work at the data link layer osi layer 2 routers work at the network layer osi layer 3 routers provide functionality beyond that offered by bridges or switches as a result however routers entail greater complexity like early bridges routers were often implemented in software running on a specialpurpose processing platform such as a personal computer pc with two network interface cards nics and software to route data between each nic as illustrated in figure 611 figure 611 pc routing with two nics view full size image the early days of routing involved a computer and two nic cards not unlike two people having a conversation but having to go through a third person to do so the workstation would send its traffic across the wire and the routing computer would receive it on one nic determine that the traffic would have to be sent out the other nic and then resend the traffic out this other nic note in the same way that a layer 2 switch is another name for a bridge a layer 3 switch is another name for a router this is not to say that a layer 3 switch and a router operate the same way layer 3 switches make decisions based on the portlevel internet protocol ip addresses whereas routers make decisions based on a map of the layer 3 network maintained in a routing table multilayer switching is a switching technique that switches at both the data link osi layer 2 and network osi layer 3 layers to enable multilayer switching lan switches must use storeandforward techniques because the switch must receive the entire frame before it performs any protocol layer operations as illustrated in figure 612 figure 612 layer 3 multilayer switch examining each frame for error before determining the destination network segment based on the network address view full size image similar to a storeandforward switch with multilayer switching the switch pulls the entire received frame into its memory and calculates its crc it then determines whether the frame is good or bad if the crc calculated on the packet matches the crc calculated by the switch the destination address is read and the frame is forwarded out the correct switch port if the crc does not match the frame the frame is discarded because this type of switching waits for the entire frame to be received before forwarding port latency times can become high which can result in some latency layer 3 switching operation you might be asking yourself whats the difference between a layer 3 switch and a router the fundamental difference between a layer 3 switch and a router is that layer 3 switches have optimized hardware passing data traffic as fast as layer 2 switches however layer 3 switches make decisions regarding how to transmit traffic at layer 3 just as a router does note within the lan environment a layer 3 switch is usually faster than a router because it is built on switching hardware bear in mind that the layer 3 switch is not as versatile as a router so do not discount the use of a router in your lan without first examining your lan requirements such as the use of network address translation nat before going forward with this discussion recall the following points a switch is a layer 2 data link device with physical ports and that the switch communicates via frames that are placed on to the wire at layer 1 physical a router is a layer 3 network device that communicates with other routers with the use of packets which in turn are encapsulated inside frames routers have interfaces for connection into the network medium for a router to route data over the ethernet for instance the router requires an ethernet interface as illustrated in figure 613 figure 613 router interfaces a serial interface is required for the router connecting to a widearea network wan and a token ring interface is required for the router connecting to a token ring network a simple network made up of two network segments and an internetworking device in this case a router is shown in figure 614 figure 614 twosegment network with a layer 3 router the router in figure 614 has two ethernet interfaces labeled e0 and e1 the primary function of the router is determining the best network path in a complex network a router has three ways to learn about networks and make the determination regarding the best path through locally connected ports static route entries and dynamic routing protocols the router uses this learned information to make a determination by using routing protocols some of the more common routing protocols used include routing information protocol rip open shortest path first ospf interior gateway routing protocol igrp and border gateway protocol bgp note routing protocols are used by routers to share information about the network routers receive and use the routing protocol information from other routers to learn about the state of the network routers can modify information received from one router by adding their own information along with the original information and then forward that on to other routers in this way each router can share its version of the network packet switching layer 3 information is carried through the network in packets and the transport method of carrying these packets is called packet switching as illustrated in figure 615 figure 615 packet switching between ethernet and token ring network segments figure 615 shows how a packet is delivered across multiple networks host a is on an ethernet segment and host b on a token ring segment host a places an ethernet frame encapsulating an internet protocol ip packet on to the wire for transmission across the network the ethernet frame contains a source data link layer mac address and a destination data link layer mac address the ip packet within the frame contains a source network layer ip address tcpip network layer address and a destination network layer ip address the router maintains a routing table of network paths it has learned and the router examines the network layer destination ip address of the packet when the router has determined the destination network from the destination ip address the router examines the routing table and determines whether a path exists to that network in the case illustrated in figure 615 host b is on a token ring network segment directly connected to the router the router peels off the layer 2 ethernet encapsulation forwards the layer 3 data packet and then reencapsulates the packet inside a new token ring frame the router sends this frame out its token ring interface on to the segment where host b will see a token ring frame containing its mac address and process it note the original frame was ethernet and the final frame is token ring encapsulating an ip packet this is called media transition and is one of the features of a network router when the packet arrives on one interface and is forwarded to another it is called layer 3 switching or routing routing table lookup routers and layer 3 switches perform table lookups determining the next hop next router or layer 3 switch along the route which in turn determines the output port over which to forward the packet or frame the router or layer 3 switch makes this decision based on the network portion of the destination address in the received packet this lookup results in one of three actions the destination network is not reachable there is no path to the destination network and no default network in this case the packet is discarded the destination network is reachable by forwarding the packet to another router there is a match of the destination network against a known table entry or to a default route if a method for reaching the destination network is unknown the first lookup tells the next hop then a second lookup is performed to determine how to get to the next hop then a final determination of the exit port is reached the first lookup can return multiple paths so the port is not known until after the determination of how to get there is made in either case the lookup returns the network layer 3 address of the nexthop router and the destination network is known to be directly attached to the router the port is directly attached to the network and reachable for directly attached networks the next step maps the host portion of the destination network address to the data link mac address for the next hop or end node using the arp table for ip it does not map the destination network address to the router interface it needs to use the mac of the final end node so that the node picks up the frame from the medium also you are assuming ip when stating that the router uses the arp table other layer 3 protocols such as internetwork packet exchange ipx do not use arp to map their addresses to mac addresses routing table lookup in an ip router might be considered more complex than a mac address lookup for a bridge because at the data link layer addresses are 48bits in length with fixedlength fieldsthe oui and id additionally datalink address space is flat meaning there is no hierarchy or dividing of addresses into smaller and distinct segments mac address lookup in a bridge entails searching for an exact match on a fixedlength field whereas address lookup in a router looks for variablelength fields identifying the destination network ip addresses are 32 bits in length and are made up of two fields the network identifier and the host identifier as illustrated in figure 616 figure 616 ip address space both the network and host portions of the ip address can be of a variable or fixed length depending on the hierarchical network address scheme used discussion of this hierarchical or subnetting scheme is beyond the scope of this book but suffice to say you are concerned with the fact that each ip address has a network and host identifier the routing table lookup in an ip router determines the next hop by examining the network portion of the ip address after it determines the best match for the next hop the router looks up the interface port to forward the packets across as illustrated in figure 617 figure 617 routing table lookup operation view full size image figure 617 shows that the router receives the traffic from serial port 1 s1 and performs a routing table lookup determining from which port to forward out the traffic traffic destined for network 1 is forwarded out the ethernet 0 e0 port traffic destined for network 2 is forwarded out the token ring 0 t0 port and traffic destined for network 3 is forwarded out serial port 0 s0 note in terms of the cisco internet operating system ios interface port numbers begin with zero 0 such as serial port 0 s0 not all vendors including cisco use ports some use slots or modules which might begin with zero or one the host identifier portion of the network address is examined only if the network lookup indicates that the destination is on a locally attached network unlike datalink addresses the dividing line between the network identifier and the host identifier is not in a fixed position throughout the network routing table entries can exist for network identifiers of various lengths from 0 bits in length specifying a default route to 32 bits in length for hostspecific routes according to ip routing procedures the lookup result returned should be the one corresponding to the entry that matches the maximum number of bits for example a network host might have both the ip address of <phone> and a mac address of 000c415340d3 the router makes decisions based on the ip address <phone> whereas the switch makes decisions based on the mac address 000c415340d3 both addresses identify the same host on the network but are used by different network devices when forwarding traffic to this host arp mapping address resolution protocol arp is a network layer protocol used in ip to convert ip addresses into mac addresses a network device looking to learn a mac address broadcasts an arp request onto the network the host on the network that has the ip address in the request replies with its mac hardware address this is called arp mapping the mapping of a layer 3 network address to a layer 2 data link address note some layer 3 addresses use the mac address as part of their addressing scheme such as ipx because the network layer address structure in ip does not provide for a simple mapping to datalink addresses ip addresses use 32 bits and datalink addresses use 48 bits it is not possible to determine the 48bit datalink address for a host from the host portion of the ip address for packets destined for a host not on a locally attached network the router performs a lookup for the nexthop routers mac address for packets destined for hosts on a locally attached network the router performs a second lookup operation to find the destination address to use in the datalink figure 618 router arp cache lookup view full size image after determining for which directly attached network the packet is destined the router looks up the destination mac address in its arp cache recall that arp enables the router to determine the corresponding mac address when it knows the network ip address the router then forwards the packet across the local network in a frame with the mac address of the local host or nexthop router note note in figure 618 that net 3 host 31 is not part of the arp cache because during the routing table lookup the router determined that this packet is to be forwarded to another remote nonlocally attached network the result of this final lookup falls into one of the three following categories the packet is destined for the router itself the ip destination address network and station portion combined corresponds to one of the ip addresses of the router in this case the packet must be passed to the appropriate higherlayer entity within the router and not forwarded to any external port the packet is destined for a known host on the directly attached network this is the most common situation encountered by a network router the router determines the mapping from the arp table and forwards the packet out the appropriate interface port to the local network the arp mapping for the specified host is unknown the router initiates a discovery procedure by sending an arp request determining the mapping of network to hardware address because this discovery procedure takes time albeit measured in milliseconds the router might drop the packet that resulted in the discovery procedure in the first place under steadystate conditions the router already has arp mappings available for all communicating hosts the address discovery procedure is necessary when a previously unheardfrom host establishes a new communication session note the current version of cisco ios 120 software drops the first packet for a destination without an arp entry the ios does this to handle denial of service dos attacks against incomplete arps in other words it drops the frame immediately instead of awaiting a reply fragmentation each output port on a network device has an associated maximum transmission unit mtu recall from earlier in this chapter that the mtu indicates the largest frame size measured in bytes that can be carried on the interface the mtu is often a function of the networking technology in use such as ethernet token ring or pointtopoint protocol ppp ppp is used with internet connections if the frame being forwarded is larger than the available space as indicated by the mtu the frame is fragmented into smaller pieces for transmission on the particular network bridges can not fragment frames when forwarding between lans of differing mtu sizes because datalink connections rarely have a mechanism for fragment reassembly at the receiver the mechanism is at the network layer implementation such as with ip which is capable of overcoming this limitation network layer packets can be broken down into smaller pieces if necessary so that these packets can travel across a link with a smaller mtu fragmentation is similar to taking a picture and cutting it into pieces so that each piece will fit into differently sized envelopes for mailing it is up to the sender to determine the size of the largest piece that can be sent and it is up to the receiver to reassemble these pieces fragmentation is a mixed blessing although it provides the means of communication across different link technologies the processing accomplishing the fragmentation is significant and could be a burden on each device having to fragment and reassemble the data further pieces for reassembly can be received out of as a rule it is best to avoid fragmentation in your network if at all possible it is more efficient for the sending station to send packets not requiring fragmentation anywhere along the path to the destination instead of sending large packets requiring intermediate routers to perform fragmentation note hosts and routers can learn the maximum mtu available along a network path through the use of mtu discovery mtu discovery is a process by which each device in a network path learns the mtu size that the network path can support",

fact sheet by s newman and l pottorff 513 quick facts tomatoes are an easy and popular vegetable to grow tomato problems may be caused by nutrient deficiencies diseases fungi or insects assess the symptoms then make the appropriate treatment good cultural practices can reduce or eliminate many problems despite the short growing season in many areas of colorado tomatoes are an easy and popular vegetable to grow for healthy tomatoes improve garden soil by adding organic material such as compost use diseaseresistant varieties eliminate competition from weeds keep the plant growing vigorously with proper water and nutrients keep the garden clean of plant debris rotate crops space plants for maximum air circulation monitor for pests failure to follow one or more of these steps can lead to pest problems to manage pests identify the source of the problem by assessing the symptoms the key in table 1 will help you narrow down the cause it is organized by affected plant parts leaves stems roots and fruit figure 1 phosphorous deficiency figure 2 psyllid damage figure 3 evidence of flea beetles figure 4 tomato hornworm figure 5 symptoms of early blight figure 6 aphids common tomato problems phosphorus deficiencies figure 1 occur early in the growing season when soil is still cool phosphorus is abundant in our soils but may be unavailable to the plant when the soil is too cold dont plant tomatoes too early in the season use plastic mulch to warm the soil once soil temperatures rise the problem usually corrects itself curly top virus is transmitted by the beet leafhopper this problem is common in western colorado but seldom found in eastern colorado infected plants turn yellow and stop growing upper leaflets roll and develop a purplish color especially along the veins leaves and stems become stiff fruit ripens prematurely it is difficult to control because leafhoppers migrate from southern areas hot dry springs with predominantly southwest winds usually indicate increased problems with this disease no chemical controls are effective use row covers to protect tomato plants from the leafhopper psyllids figure 2 are more commonly found in eastern colorado and are seldom a problem in western colorado they feed on tomato or potato plant sap and inject a toxic saliva that causes the characteristic psyllid yellows leaves turn yellow veins often turn purple stems may become distorted giving the bush a zigzag appearance to confirm psyllids check the undersides of leaves for nymphs nymphs are about the size of an aphid at first they are yellow then they turn green they are sedentary while feeding and secrete small white granules that resemble sugar for best control dust the foliage especially potato and tomato psyllids flea beetles figure 3 are small black or brown beetles that jump when disturbed the adults chew small holes or pits in leaves wounded tissue may be more susceptible to diseases such as early blight most plants outgrow flea beetle damage insecticides such as cabaryl or permethrin are effective controls if needed see 5592 flea beetles tomato or tobacco hornworms figure 4 are large green or graygreen caterpillars with white to tan vshaped or dashed markings on their sides a green to reddish horn protrudes from the hind end they are voracious feeders stripping leaves from stems and even eating unripe fruit pick them off by hand the caterpillars are susceptible to bacillus thuringiensis bt as well as to many common vegetable insecticides early blight alternaria leaf spot figure 5 is caused by the fungus alternaria solani symptoms become prevalent during the hotter months this disease produces brown to black targetlike spots on older leaves if severe the fungus also attacks stems and fruit affected leaves may turn yellow then drop leaving the fruit exposed to sunburn sanitation is the best control remove all diseased plant tissue on the ground as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris do not plant tomatoes in the same place next year space plants farther apart to improve air circulation avoid overhead irrigation if the infestation is heavy sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection septoria leaf spot is less common in colorado than early blight it too is a fungal disease characteristic symptoms are white or gray spots on leaves surrounded by a black or brown margin control is similar to early blight whiteflies and aphids figure 6 both cause leaf yellowing and leave a characteristic sticky excrement called honeydew leaves appear shiny and are somewhat sticky when honeydew is present damage usually is minimal on tomatoes and often can be ignored if aphids become a problem some applications of insecticidal soap are quite effective cucumber mosaic virus and herbicide injury are almost impossible to tell apart without previous knowledge of chemicals applied or laboratory confirmation cucumber mosaic virus causes tomato plants to yellow and become bushy and stunted leaves may be mottled the virus most often is carried in tomato seeds mechanical transmission by workers touching plants and movement by aphid carriers can occur but this is much less common in tomatoes than in cucurbits remove and destroy plants there are no chemical controls figure 7 fusarium wilt fusarium wilt and fusarium crown rot symptoms figure 7 begin as yellowing of older leaves with fusarium crown rot the leaves often turn brown or black and eventually wilt with fusarium wilt the yellow leaves turn downward and droop fusarium oxysporum the cause of both diseases is a common tomato fungus that lives in the plants vascular system which carries water from the roots to the leaves to see if either of these diseases is present check watering practices both over and underwatering can mimic disease symptoms check the roots discolored roots indicate root rot cut the lower or main stem and look inside at the vascular tissue fusarium wilt causes a dark brown discoloration within the vascular tissue fusarium crown rot causes a rot or canker at the base of the stem and possibly a root rot most tomato seeds or transplants are labeled with a code such as vfn vfna vfnt etc this indicates that the plants are resistant to verticillium wilt v fusarium wilt f southern rootknot nematode n early blight a or tobacco tomato mosaic virus t verticillim wilt and root knot nematodes rarely cause a problem in colorado but if you have had a fusarium wilt problem in the past it would be a good idea to choose a variety labeled f do not plant tomatoes potatoes or eggplant in the affected area for two or three years no fungicides are labeled for figure 8 bacterial canker figure 9 tomato spotted wiltimpatiens necrotic spot bacterial canker figure 8 occurs sporadically in colorado symptoms begin with lower leaves turning downward dark to light brown streaks may develop on the leaf midribs and eventually extend down the petiole to form a canker on the stem there may be vascular discoloration symptoms on fruit are small white scabby raised lesions often described as birds eye this disease is difficult to distinguish from other tomato diseases and may need laboratory confirmation if identified destroy the plants do not compost plant material do not plant tomatoes potatoes or eggplant in the same soil for two to three years tomato spotted wiltimpatiens necrotic spot tospoviruses tswv or insv figure 9 has traditionally been a problem in commercial tomato production recently however the disease has increasingly been found in home gardens symptoms begin as dark brown to purple spots on leaves the dark areas spread to stems forming cankers stem streaking also may be noticed wilting symptoms gradually develop as the disease spreads however the leaf tissue is stiff not limp the most noticeable symptoms are yellow rings or spots on fruit fruit may be distorted tswv and insv are moved from plant to plant by western flower thrips the only way to manage the disease greenhouse plant viruses tswvinsv root rot can be caused by several fungi however poor soil drainage and overwatering are always involved for home gardeners control of a potential root rotting fungus is almost impossible therefore management of root rot requires soil improvement proper watering and rotation of tomatoes plant tomatoes and related species in the same garden spot only once every three years figure 10 catfacing figure 11 blossom end rot figure 12 sunscald on tomato fruit catfacing figure 10 is a term that describes tomato fruit that is misshapen with scars and holes in the blossom end the cause is thought to be cold weather during blossoming and perhaps high levels of nitrogen to manage it avoid setting out transplants too early in the season blossom end rot figure 11 begins as light tan watersoaked lesions on the blossom end of the fruit these lesions enlarge and turn black and leathery the cause is thought to be a combination of cold temperatures or excessive heat during blossom set and fluctuations in water supply when these two factors occur simultaneously calcium often becomes unavailable to the plant hence a calcium deficiency occurs during fruit formation to manage the problem fertilize and water properly avoid setting out transplants too early in the season use mulch to help reduce fluctuations in moisture levels stink bugs cause spots and internal damage to tomato fruit by their feeding adults are shieldshaped and brown or green with red pink or yellow markings they release an offensive odor when handled control weeds around the tomato patch as these insects overwinter in such areas stink bug damage on green fruit appears as dark pinpricks surrounded by a light discolored area as fruit ripens these spots may remain green or turn yellow the tissue underneath is white and spongy cavities may form under the damaged skin sunscald figure 12 is common on fruit exposed to too much sun this problem often occurs when infestations of hornworms are high and defoliation or pruning of leaves is heavy to help control sunscald shade the plant and reduce the fruits exposure to the sun greenyellow shoulders develop on ripening fruit possibly due to high temperatures chlorophyll in this area is slow to break down and results in a patch that remains green or turns yellow but not red this problem may affect the entire shoulder or only a small irregular patch shade the plant and take other precautions to reduce the fruits exposure to the sun table 1 key to the identification of tomato problems leaves purple leaves leaves with purple veins and overall purplish tint early season cool temperatures no insects present phosphorus deficiency leaflets roll upward and develop a purplish color especially along the veins curly top virus yellowed leaves slight distortion purpling of veins zigzag stem and branching pattern check underside of leaves for insects psyllids infected plants turn yellow and soon stop growing curly top

    "text": "lifes blood class notes rh system history in 1939 hemolytic disease of the newborn was first described by levine and stetson the cause of hemolytic disease of the cause was not specifically identified but maternal antibody suspected a year later 1940 karl landsteiner and alexander wiener injected animals with rhesus monkey cells to produce an antibody which reacted with 85 of human red cells which they named antirh within a year levine made connection between maternal antibody causing hdn and antirh between 194345 the other common antigens of the rh system were identified for many years the exact inheritance of the rh factors were debated weiner promoting rh and hr terminology and fisherrace utilizing dccee for the various rh antigens in 1993 tippett discovered true mode of rh inheritance using molecular diagnostics rh antigens d rh o is the most important antigen after a and b antigens unlike the antia and antib antibodies antid antibodies are only seen if a patient lacking d antigen is exposed to d cells the exposure of d cells usually occurs through pregnancy or transfusion there are 5 principle antigens that may be found in most individuals they are d found in 85 of the population c found in 70 of the population e found in 30 of the population c found in 80 of the population e found in 98 of the population d which has never been identified but refers to the 15 of the population who has no d antigen there are at over 50 rh antigens that have been identified including those that are either combinations of these antigens or weak expressions of the above antigens but most rh problems are due to d c e c or e alleles the common alleles are c and c are alleles with c w occasionally seen as a weaker expression of c e and e are alleles although e is seen only a third as often as e the e antigen is referred to as a high incidence antigen since it is found in 98 of the population d and the lack of d or d are alleles characteristics of rh antigens the rh antigens together are proteins of 417 amino acids these proteins cross the red cell membrane 12 times there are only small loops of the protein on the exterior of the cell membrane therefore the rh antigens are not as available to react with their specific antibodies and there are fewer antigen sites than abo unlike the abo system the rh antigens are not soluble and are not expressed on the tissues they are well developed at birth and therefore can easily cause hemolytic disease of the newborn if the baby has a rh antigen that the mother lacks besides the antigens being welldeveloped at birth they are very good immunogens this is especially true to d which if the most immunogenic after a and b antigens rh antibodies unlike the abo antibodies that are mainly igm the rh antibodies are commonly igg they are not naturally occurring and therefore are formed by immune stimulus due to transfusions or babys red blood cells during pregnancy the most common antibody to form is antid in rh negative individuals since rh antibodies are igg they bind best at 37 o c and their reactions will be observed with the indirect antiglobulin technique agglutination reactions are enhanced by high protein albumin lowionic strength saline liss proteolytic enzymes ficin and polytheylene glycol peg rh antibodies will react more strongly with homozygous cells than with heterozygous cells for example an antie will react with strongly with ee cells and more weakly with ee cells this is called dosage both hemolytic disease of the newborn and hemolytic transfusion reactions can occur due the various rh antibodies antid has been the biggest concern since it was recognized in the 1940s as being the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn since the d antigen is so immunogenic we screen all donor units for the d antigen therefore if an individual is a it means both the a and the d antigens are present on the other hand if an individual is a the a antigen is present and the d antigen is absent to prevent problems due to antid we try to always give rhnegative individuals rhnegative blood and we give rh o immune globulin to rhnegative mothers to prevent the formation of antid during pregnancy the incidence of rh antibodies antid most common antibody seen in rhd negative people antie most common antibody seen in rh pos people since only 30 of the population have the antigen antic or antic less common most people have the antigen antie often seen as autoantibody and will make it difficult to find compatible blood since 98 of the population have the e antigen antice or antice often seen in combination if a patient lacks both a c and e and has made an antic then enhancement techniques should be done to make sure that an antie is not also present rh system inheritance from the 1940s to the 1990s the mechanism for inheritance of the rh blood group system was in question the terminology that is part of the fisherrace theory is most commonly used even today fisherrace theory the fisherrace theory involved the presence of 3 separate genes d c and e and their alleles c and e and the absence of d since an antid has never been found these three genes are closely linked on the same chromosome and are inherited as a group of 3 the most common group of 3 genes inherited is cde and ce d negative is the second most common weiner theory weiner believed there was one gene complex with a number of alleles resulting in the presence of various rh antigens according to weiner there were 8 alleles r o r 1 r 2 r z r r r r y which ended up with different antigens on the red cells that he called rh o rh rh hr hr weiner terminology is not use as often today but you will often see rh o d when a person considered to be rhpositive at times the gene terms are easier to use than fisherrace if a person has the fisherrace genotype of dcedce it is easier to refer to that type as r 1 r 1 2 made up of combinations of genetic products tippett theory in 1986 tippett predicted that there are two closelylinked genes rhd and rhce the rhd gene determines whether the d antigen that spans the membrane is present caucasians who are d negative have no gene at that gene loci in the japanese chinese and blacks of african descent have an inactive or partial gene at this site the rhce gene determines c c e e antigens produced from the alleles rhce rhce rhce rhce rh gene complexes antigens possible combinations and percentages haplotypes genes present antigens present phenotype percentage r 1 rhd rhce dce

fisherrace there are times when you will need to convert weiner to fisherrace or vice versa it will be easier to do these conversions if you remember the following r always refers to d whether it is r o r 1 r 2 or the very rare r z r always refers to the lack of d o refers to having no c or e 1 or always refers to c 2 or always refers to e the very rare haplotypes that have both a c and e are given letters from the end of the alphabet z and y determining genotypes from phenotypes the following steps will be helpful in determining from the individuals phenotype these rules are based on probability so the least likely genotypes will involve r z or r y type patient for the five rh antigens d c c e e start with d is it positive or negative if negative the individual will be homozygous d if positive for d you cant tell yet whether the individual is homozygous or heterozygous for d therefore put d on just one chromosome look at c is it positive or negative if negative put c on each chromosome if positive look at c result to determine if the c is homozygous or heterozygous if there is no c present there would be two c and it would be homozygous if a c is present as well as c they are heterozygous if homozygous then put c on each chromosome if heterozygous put c on same chromosome as d put c on other look at e is it positive or negative if negative put e on each chromosome if positive look at e result to determine if homozygous or heterozygous if homozygous put e on each chromosome if heterozygous put e on same chromosome as the d unless the d already has a c put e on other chromosome dce is more common than dce and dce is extremely rare put c and e together on same chromosome only if no other possible combinations most common genotypes the following genotypes are listed as the most common with 1 being the most common in whites and 7 the least common r z and r y are so rare they are not included in the following table incidence of the most common genotypes

2 r 03 01 applications of rh genotyping paternity testing of the blood group antigens is based on a process of exclusion since the rhd and rhce are closely linked and ce ce ce are produced by a single gene there are limited combinations that the father can provide hdn predictability by testing the fathers rh genotype this helps predict likelihood of hdn due to d when mom has antid the most common rh genotype of the father will indicate whether the baby has o 50 or 100 probability of being d positive if the father is also d negative cece the baby will be d negative as well and there is a 0 probability of the baby suffering from rh o hdn if the fathers rh genotype appears to be either r 1 r r 2 r or r o r the baby has a 50 probability of being d positive and suffering from rh o hdn on the other hand if a fathers rh genotype appears to be any of the following r 1 r 1 r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 r o r o r 1 r o or r 2 r o the baby has a 100 probably of getting a d gene from his father and

testing ie being demonstrated only by coombs technique an rh control must always be run along with the weak d test always consult the product insert to determine if rh control needs to be run when performing the immediate spin d testing the following results could be obtained when performing the d testing immediate spin 37 o c antid agt interpretation antid rh co antid rh co antid rh co 0 d positive 0 0 0 0 0 weak d 0 0 0 0 0 0 true d negative 0 0 0 0 or any time the rh control is positive you can not interpret the results and need to perform further testing testing for weak d aabb requires that all donor blood that originally fails to react with antid at immediate spin must be tested for weak d units that test weak d positive would be labeled d positive and would be transfused only to d positive individuals hospitals may or may not test all rh negative recipients for weak d the cost of time and reagents is minimized if only the immediate spin this may create some confusion with the recipient if their donor card indicates they are rh positive but they type rh negative when they are the recipient recipients that type d negative at immediate spin would be given d negative blood which not create a problem for the patient when performing testing prenatal and postnatal mothers dnegative blood at immediate spin would be tested for weak d as well to determine if they are eligible for rh o immune globulin since rh o immune globulin is actually antid it is safe for a true d negative but not for a weak d positive mother why do weak ds exist there are three explanations for weak ds quantitative weak d there are individuals that quantitatively produce fewer d antigen sites this is more common in blacks and is often seen with the dce haplotype on rare occasions among whites an unusual dce or dce may also produce a quantitatively decrease weak d position effect weak d in this case the d is weakened by the position of a c on the opposite haplotype which is called the trans position the two rh genotype combinations where this type of weak d is seen are dcece and dcece today this type of weak d would type as a regular d due to the improvement of reagents partial d antigen mosaic d it has been found that some dpositive individuals make an alloantid that reacts with other d positive cells but not their own many of these will demonstrate a weak d type of reaction in this type of weak d the individuals are lack some of the components of the d antigen and therefore are able to make allantibodies to those specific components if they are transfused with d positive blood other rh system variants there are presently 46 rh antigens identified and named the following are the most common of those variants c w is a low frequency antigen found in approximately 2 of whites and 1 of blacks it is not an allele of c and c its allele is mar which is found in 999 of the population v and vs are low frequency alleles found in 1 or less of the whites but are more common in blacks v is found in 30 of the blacks and vs in 32 g is present when d or c present due to the present of serine at the 103 position of the rh polypeptide antig will react with both d and c cells f is present when c and e together on same chromosome dce or ce this is the most common of what are called cis product antigens rh null has no rh antigens on their red cells but these individual can transmit normal rh antigens to their offspring in the most common type the core rh polypeptide is missing a less common type has the regulator gene that turns off the expression of rh there have been at least 43 individuals in 14 families that are rh null in these individuals the red blood cell membrane is abnormal and some of these have been identified when it was observed that they had hemolytic anemia and abnormal red cell morphology if these individuals develop an rh antibody following a transfusion or pregnancy it is considered a antitotal rh antibody rh typing false positives false positive ds occur when following through to agt for weak d and will be identified as false positive by a positive rh control this is seen when a patientdonor has strong positive dat the cells are coated with antibody not necessarily rh antibody in vivo albumin is necessary in reagent antid to overcome the zeta potential allowing cells coated with igg antid to get close enough together to agglutinate but cells coated in vivo with any igg antibody will also agglutinate in albumin these false positives are corrected by using form of antid that does not require albumin there are two types of alternative types of antid monoclonal igm antid will cause agglutination of d positive cells without the presence of albumin at room temperature a number of facilities normally use this type of antid and therefore do not routinely use rh control chemically modified antid has been modified by breaking the disulfide bonds closest to the hinge region so antibody can reach cells that are farther apart false positive can also be caused by rouleaux formation which will look like agglutination macroscopically rouleaux would be identified microscopically due to the coinstacking appearance of the red cells this false positive would be corrected by washing cells 3 to 4 times and then retesting false negatives false negatives are not readily identifiable but can occur in the following instances the most common is the result of too heavy cell suspension due to too many cells for the amount of antibody in the antisera they may also rarely be caused by extremely strong positive dat in this case a the patients d antigen sites are coated in vivo and there are no sites left for commercial antid to attach to this can be fixed by heating cells gently to elute off antibody without damaging cells then retest objectives rh system briefly describe how and when the rh system was discovered list the major rh antigens and state the frequency each is seen in the

labs was created as a result of the research of three cit graduate students jon elwood ericka elwoodwoolum and wilfred bergman the company worked in defense solutions and research for the military jon elwood became the director of the facility and was married to ericka woolum the company had been working on a new piece of power armor before the bombs fell they were on a military contract to produce this power armor for soldiers fighting in the war when the bombs were dropped jon elwood was told by the military that only essential personnel would be given a military escort to safety because of this he locked the scientists including his wife into their labs until the project was completed if the team was able to complete the project elwood would have reached out to his contact in the military and received a safe escape unfortunately he kept every scientist besides his wife out of the loop with what had truly transpired above them fearing that it would send them into a panic and they would be unable this act of deception widened conflicts between the scientists and ultimately led to the deaths of a portion of the research team and the ghoulification of the remainder layout

still in the tube keep asking your companion to inspect the tube then place another reagent in the tube until all reagent quest items are removed from your inventory a player character can use the

    "text": "frogmans guide to silver in world of tanks popular first if the moderators feel this should be located in another forum location please feel free to move it over the past few months i have seen many many many people post both here as well as on my clan forums with comments about having lack of silver many people seem to have troubles with silver management i would like to share my own personal thoughts and strategies on the subject in hopes that my personal strategies will benefit someone in this thread i will be discussing both the incredibly obvious and well as some of the not so obvious ways in which peoplepreviously myself included burn through silver without noticing and then wonder why they are always broke i am not an english major so there may be some spelling errors or perhaps a few long winded sentences as well as a liberal injection of my own personal brand of witticisms and humor i realize some of my humor may not be appreciated by some but i ask that you stick with me and try to pick up nuggets of wisdom attempting to be imparted if there are those who wish to comment or provide some helpful criticism that would assist in readability please feel free to comment and your thoughts will be considered and with that i silver production the mechanics joining a battle yes you get a small amount of silver just by the act of entering a battle this is a small flat bonus which scales by tank tier and should really be seen as icing on the cake ie if this is your only action you will be very broke for a long time spotting a tank for the first time yep you get a bit of silver just for being the first to see an enemy tank double the amount if its an artillery piece however this amount is very small so again it can not be counted on as your primary income source base capture this method of earning silver provides a very small flat bonus to each person within the base when it is captured damaging the enemy this is your number 1 means of earning silver and should be one of your primary goals in the game victory the joining a battle bonus is multiple by 185 this is quite small bonus so really is nothing that will drastically increase you silver production againits just icing on the cake tank coefficient each tank in the game has a hidden number which affects its silver production incomeie the tank you are playing so two different tier v tanks that both did 100 damage to the exact same enemy tank and no other actions have the potential to earn difference silver payments premium tanks almost always have a vastly higher coefficient compared to normal tanks earning silver the details do damage as much as you can if you want silver you should continue to seek out enemy tanks you can shoot as long as you remain alive with the exception of the goal of capping to win when you feel you must to secure a victory sitting in a corner somewhere will not earn you extra silveri promise doing damage is the single thing that you can do within the game that will drastically increase your silver earnings the fact is that the more damage you do the more silver you will earnhowever as we will discuss later there is overhead that will reduce your net with that said here is where it gets a bit complicated because not all damage is the equal the current game mechanics provide different silverand xp for that matter amounts depending upon what you damage so for example if you are in a tier v tank and you do 100 damage to a tier iii tank you will earn less silver than if you had done the exact same 100 damage to a tier vii tank there are those who prefer capturing the enemy base as a means of winning the game however due to both the silver and xp potential i will rarely capture an enemy base unless that is the only means of victory within the battle in cases where i finish an engagement i use the back button and plot the shortest route to the next engagement in an attempt to deal more damage and thus get more silverand xp even if it appears at first glance that i would not make it before the enemy is destroyed or someone might be capturing likewise in the case of hopeless situations such as your team was slaughtered on the other side of the map and its not a 7 on 1 against you i will not suicide my tank and will continue looking for something to shoot and to which i can attempt to deal damage it really does not matter what tank or what tier it is the fight is not over until the enemy kills me themselves on a side note not giving up can be rewarded with a bit of luck and skill with a nice shiny koblanovs medal and i purchase a premium tank remember above when i talked about the tank coefficient coefficient is a fancy word for multiplieryou can think of it like that its can be a bit more complicated in the actual formula but this is the easiest word for most people to understand to get the general concept and the fact is that premium tanks have a larger multiplierthough they are not all the same multiplier premium tanks can earn you a great deal of silver income in a short amount of time as an example i have an is6 which is a tier viii premium russian tank i typically get an average games where i earn 75k silver per match i have had matches where i net as much as 175k with premium timewhich we will talk about in a bit though it is possible i rarely lose money in my is6yep i have crap games sometimes and occasionally i even get a streak of them you have to try really really hard to lose money in an is6 when played even close to correctly with that said the is6 is not a money press i t is still contingent upon you actually going out and doing damage out of my almost 400 games in the is6392 games and 078 of all games played i have been in the red approximately 10 times with premium and approximately 20 times without premium i wont discuss which specific premium to buy as i really dont know i will caution you though to not purchase a high tier premium tank when your skills dont support play in its tier not only are you not realizing the full benefit of the tank but you are also being an active drain upon your fellow teammates i realize that there are people who cant or wont spend real world money on a free game though so please read on as there are plenty of other strategies that will help both you and well as those who do financially support wga purchase premium time this really depends greatly upon the amount of time spent playing wot if you play quite infrequently then purchasing premium time is likely not worth it for your however i would hazard a guess that most people who read the forums have at least some dedication to the game and play as much as they are able one word of note here premium time is a subscription service you pay for a block of real world time and it will never be paid for by time used be warned this is critical for someone who buys one day and then for example consider a tank special where you get a premium tank and 3 days of premium time it would be exceptionally silly to purchase the tank 30 minutes before you are to leave for a week long vacation as the premium time will run out and be used your best value in this situation would be where you will have a substantial amount of time available to play the game and put the purchased premium time to its best possible use note that premium time purchases are similar to many other economies of scale in todays world the larger the block of time you purchase at a single time the less you pay per time unit if you have the means to purchase the largest possible unitright around 1 year it will provide you with the cheapest per hour charge so to speak again as mentioned above there are plenty of people who cant or wont spend money so please continue to read on i provide the paid options near the top because quite frankly they are the best possible methods take advantage of special events wga frequently have special events that can increase silver production these typically take the form of something like 50 silver earned increase on german and russian tank tier iiv 30 silver earned increase on german and russian tank tier vivii 25 silver earned for upon earning the following medals xxx check each day the news to see if there is a special event which can earn you extra silver for example if there is an event that increases silver gain for all tier v vehicles on a weekend forgo playing your tier viii and play more of your tier v during the event time period this can really help you generate more silver likewise many times events had discounts on certain tier thank if you were going to purchase a specific tank anyway take advantage of that special however please make sure to carefully read below remember just because something is on sale that does not mean you need to buy it on the flip side its very important that you do not sell any tanks that are part of the special events when a tank is offered for purchase for a discounted price then the sell price is reduced by the exact same amount add to that fact that all tanks only net you 50 of the original purchase price and selling a particular tank that is discounted during the event is a want to lose massive amounts of silver especially at the higher tier if you are following my guide principles you can wait a few additional days as you already have enough to purchase the new tank you just unlocked and still hold onto the old tank for a few additional days until its not longer on sell and maximize your silver losses spending silver buying tanksupgrading packages this is why most people play the game some want to get to specific tanks and work toward that goal others want to have all tanks unlocked at some pointthats me regardless most people will at some point buy some different tanks from the one they start with i will detail what i see as both positive and negative approaches many people i have encountered who have issues with silver have lots of tanks in their garage and they are actively playing every single one in my humble opinion this is a mistaken approach if you are already having issues with silver reserves this is made even worse by those who have purchased additional garage slots either individually or via a parking pass block personally i recommend having 23 tanks on which you can grind hard i also suggest staggering these tanks by at least one tier and perhaps 2 for a less adept player the issue is that upgrading another thing i see people do is purchase child tank as soon as they have completed the research on it and its been made available again this is a poor strategy for someone who is already running on low silver reserves my personal approach is to complete research on a tank and then continue to play the tank for multiple days or in a few cases weeks i tend to play a tank for approximately 350 games more than required to get the tank to elite there are a few exceptions to this rule though as there are some tanks following this approach has multiple benefits for one it allows you to continue to hone your skills before you advance to higher tier play secondly and more germain it allows you to build your silver reserves to the point that you have more than enough silver to purchase the new tank fully equip it and purchase a crew without being forced to sell the child tank to do so my personal rule of thumb here is that i must have a minimum of three times the purchase price of the tank and all equipment and consumables before i consider the purchase another benefit that i enjoy is the challenge of trying to obtain the 99 mastery badge in most of my tanks some i can get within the normal play while others i got after the tank was elite and a fewthat i tried hard for i was just not able to easily obtain always coming up around 100200 xp short still its a goal i strive for because i am anal my point being slow down the tanks are not going anywhere and will be there personally i have roughly 18 garage slots with 4 of those free out of that i have perhaps 3 tanks that i am grinding on and the rest are elite between tiers 28 special note one of the worst offenders in this category is the wg tech tree specialsto be superseded by path to x event stop just dont unless you are ready to give up a line for a good long while to start a new one dont even bother with the tech tree specials they will eat through your silver reserves this is especially true if your garage is small and you have to sell a tank to make room because sold tanks only net you half of the original cost i used to chase them for the first 2 months i stopped as mentioned above though make 100 sure you do not see the old tank if it also is part of the special as you will lose massive amounts of silver just purchase the new tank keep the old tank and sell the old tank after the event ends equipment there are two types of equipment that can be put onto a tank simple and complex simple equipment generally costs much less and more importantly can be removed and will gain your full silver price payed back complex equipment on the other hand typically is quite expensive price scales depending upon tier but consider 500k in the viiis and can not be sold without spending gold to dismount first spending gold will allow you to recoup the entire purchase price of the equipment it is critical to note you should dequip all equipment prior to selling a tank imho if you have limited money supplies keeping a bit of gold around solely for this purpose will save you an inordinate amount of silver as you progress through that tank tiers some people drastically underestimate the impact having the right equipment on the right tank can have but i highly recommend each of you to always put appropriate equipment on every tank you plan to grid as it really does assist in keeping you in the fight longer and thus able to generate more silver in the long run each tank has different equipment that is optimal for use as a general rule i would suggest most people not purchase equipment for tiers iii or lower unless its a tank you plan to keep andor play often consumables this includes things such the critical ones such as repair kit first aid fire extinguisher etc as well as premium ammo and premium consumables in general i equip at least repair kit first aid and fire extinguisher on most tanks i own however with that said some such as the fire extinguisher are far more important on certain tanks than others for example many german tanks have a much increased chance of catching fire and thus you need to do your research as there are many tanks i would never even dream of leaving the garage without a fire extinguisher there are also premium versions which appear to cost gold but can be purchased with silver instead the premium versions cost 20k each but in addition to the one time use as long as they are not used they provide a potential static boost for example a large repair kit provides a permanent decreaseie it takes less time in the time to repair modules as long as you dont use the primary benefitimmediate repair a premium fire extinguisher decreases the chance of fire in the first place as well as speeds fire fighting when a fire does occur alternately some tanks generally by nation have other consumables which are also equipable things such as chocolate case of cola etc these also cost either gold or 20k silver these items typically provide a boost to all crew skills for the duration of the battle and used immediately when the battle starts in most cases i would typically suggest avoiding these items except on specific occasions for example if you have an elite vehicle and are trying to get an elusive 99 mastery badge and want a bit extra umph however i would never suggest using these items unless you have and extreme surplus of silver to burn finally there is premium or goldquot ammo for most tanks this is either apcr or in some cases heat or hesh many people shy away from premium ammo on the theory that a it costs to much andor b that it makes you less of a tanker imho neither of those are true statements many people still dont know that gold ammo can be purchased with silver but on average it is 4 times more expensive than ap ammo that comes standard the key is in knowing when to use premium ammo for example if apcr costs 4 times the amount of your ap ammo but you bounce 5 shots which is would have benefitted you more to use a big part of this is knowing the tank you are in and the tanks you are facing each premium ammo has different characteristics which you must study to understand their strengths and limitations for example apcr has higher penetration compared to standard ap ammo however it drops penetration over distances so you typically do not want to shoot apcr at someone 500 meters away i typically carry a load out of 34 hehigh explosives and then 2030 apcror heat or hesh as the case may be and the remainder in standard ap ammo in general knowing the target you are facing your guns penetration and the targets armor will help you decide when to switch to premium ammo or not as a general rule though you would typically never shoot premium ammo at a lower tier tank and would consider it when facing a higher tier tank also in most cases armor is weaker on sides or rear and premium is generally less needed a situation where i will switch to apcr in a hurry is when i am facing multiple opponents by myself and they have better armor than my gun will penetrate easily this situation becomes even more desperate and needed when youre the last guy left vs 3 tanks all on low health and you want to maximize your chance of winning the game one bounced shot could easily make the difference between living and dying when you do not want to try using premium ammo is when you have a very large aiming reticle and only a small part of it on a part of a target tank make sure if youre using premium ammo you have the most possible chance of hittingthough premium ammo can bounce and not penetrate for example if they are behind a rock and their track is out but only fills around 20 of your reticle dont fire premium or youre very likely to be throwing away money premium ammo will earn you money every time you hit and penetrate so its really important to use it wisely battle taking damage and ammo repair costs eat into silver its a delicate balance of doing damage while not wasting ammo as well as being where the action is so that you can actually do damage but without taking too much in return you also have to factor in a balance of should i shoot something that is almost dead or do lots of damage to this health guy right next to him in general you want knock an opponent out of the fight as soon as possible because dead tanks dont shoot back likewise if with a group use this tactic to coordinate fire upon the same vehicle and get each opponent gun out of the battle as quick as possible to help mitigate damage taken and ensure long term survivability silver challenges in higher tiers most people have challenges in higher tier matches due to the much higher repair and ammo costs for this reason many people elect to keep a few mid tier tanks the sweet spot seems to be in the area of tier v viii for ensuring fairly high average silver production personally i dont tend to have so many issues in my high tier games but i just got my first tier x tank so perhaps its a bit too early to tell i will note that as i was first getting into the mid tiers i instantly fell in love with the with the silver earning abilities of the t1 heavy after the pure suck that was the m3 leeconstant money loses i was fairly giddy once i began playing the t1 heavy i remember playing nothing but that for several days to finance other tanks and earning well over 1 million within a few hours of playingthe most silver i had been able to achieve at the time my lack of silver was due to running too many tanks that had to constantly being upgraded chasing tech tree specials etcall the things i mention above to not do while the t1 heavy was my first money maker tank there are plenty of them out there find one you both enjoy playing as well as makes you good average silver earnings for you and play that tank a lot remember wot is a marathon not a sprint its a long game strategy to manage silver reserves as a side benefit if you find a tank that is both enjoyable to play as well as one you do well in consistently this increases your free xp earned better to have 500 matches making 1000 xp in a tier v tank i hope the information presented provides people with some assistance in gaining and keeping enough silver and never feeling like youre broke the main thing is you dont have to buy something new just because its available and its often advisable to not make that purchase only do so when you feel comfortable with the silver you will have left after the sale is completed thank you for your time edited by joedafrogman 04 march 2015 0919 pm twitchtv frogmans guide to silver in world of tanks want to win more learn to count shadow puppets are illogical

agree with paul h and akdoug and the story goes like this on the last evening of a clients last day of a hunt he shot a bear in the upper left shoulder as it was sitting like a dog facing directly toward him the guide could not find the blood trail as it got dark so they staggered back into camp at 100am the next morning the client left and the outfitter and four guides and a packer went out to find the wounded brown bear although blood was not visible we spread out several yards apart and slowly entered a sea of alder brush looking for boo boo bear in the middle of us was a packer who had brought a pistol grip 12 gauge shotgun loaded with 00 buckshot as his packergun while all of us had big guns of course the packer walked directly into the wounded bear at 5 yards or 15 feet the bear was laying on his back with his legs toward the gun and his head away from the guns and sat up the packer shot the bear in the middle of the chest with two blasts of 00 buck the bear was already feeling poorly from having his shoulder shotup although it if you must take a shotgun bring slugs ill bring my ol hammer big ugly my old 338 guide gun and the packer became an alaskan state trooper a

range less than spitting range on the other hand a load of 00 in the face of a charging bear might change its mind even if it didnt penetrate the skull as for the body it might not have the

join date apr 2006 location anchorage posts 5686 id thought i was done with this thread but in light of some recent posts figured id add a few more comments imho anyone that chooses a gun based on its ability to scare or wound an animal has chosen the wrong tool for the job in a true dlp case you need something that will kill the bear under less than ideal situations anything less than that puts you and others at risk from a wounded bear wounded bears are the most dangerous they are not less dangerous than unwounded bears if you want to disuade a bear carry pepper spray if you want to kill a bear carry an appropriate gun i used to carry a mossberg mariner loaded with 00 and slugs per common ak advice the trouble was when i tested 00 at the range 10 yards to see the pattern i realized the folly with 00 if you assume that it will pattern out then you are really having faith in the magic pellet theory that theory is that somehow one of those 15 pellets will be fatal lets look at a single pellet of 00 it has the same terminal perform as a black powder squirel rifle aka a 32 caliber lead ball at <phone> fps i if you assume the shot load is a dense mass then you have to place that load with the same precision as a single round no more no less and as a single mass a load of 00 falls shy of what the best slugs can do so if you are back to a long gun to place a single shot on a target at close range what is the better choice the shotgun or an appropriate rifle look at what the bear guides carry and youll find the vast majority carry rifles generally starting at 338 win mag and going up they are the ones that have actually had to fire close range killing shots on bears under less than ideal situations they have seen what works and what doesnt about the only thing those guides seem to do over the years is move to more something to consider <phone> 17 fishingis4play new member join date apr 2006 location wasilla alaska posts 199 slugs 12 ga 3 inch brenneke black magic

collecting some water and allowing it to settle before filtering or by using some sort of pre filter coffee filters seem to work pretty well to get the bulk of the silt out you could also just use your filter im not sure how many liters you can get out of a filter when it is getting loaded with silt another option would be to find another source of water that is from runoff <phone> 3 jim strutz member join date aug 2006 location anchorage posts 1449 theoretically giardia cysts or other pests could get into water 10 from the glacier face but chances are its pretty safe there are ice worms in some glaciers but i believe they are safe to ingest of course the farther you get from the source the more likely something could get into the water so if youre 1020 miles from the glacier its probably not that safe even though its still cold silty the reality is most fresh alaska water will not make you sick 9 times out of 10 youll be fine but thats not much better odds than playing russian roulette so i dont do it the silt wont hurt you though you can strain it through your teeth if you want leaves a funny grit in your mouth but ive drunk plenty of it years ago silty water is a pain to filter even after sitting overnight there is enough fine silt to clog your filter pretty quick prefiltering helps but doesnt cure the problem and your prefilter clogs up quick you could use chemical treatments but some cysts are notorious for suviving chlorine andor iodine uv lights are great on the cysts but dont penetrate well enough in the silt to be effective the only other solution is boiling well that and taking the bet that this is one of those 9 out of 10 safe places i look for clean looking sources for filtering <phone> 4 broncoformudv member join date apr 2006 location anchorage alaska posts 4670 there are enough clear streams in alaska that i have never contemplated dealing with glacier water never liked having sand in my mouth and dont plan on drinking sandy water if i can help it you can filter it out but it will clog up your filter in no time and will even make it past a pre filter and or clog the pre filter in no time <phone> 5 brettaksci member join date

posts 451 drink the water if you are high in a valley and taking water out of a fast moving glacial stream just drink the water i have for over 40 yrs and when i was young we drank from the lakes although i wouldnt suggest that now knowing a little more about the bugs in some water i think high in a sheep drainage is a whole lot safer than 9 out of 10 unless its really turbulent water the silt is probably not even noticable <phone> 10 alaskatrueadventure member join date apr 2006 location paradise alaska posts 1543 clear h2o jimss there is clear water at the airstripbase camp location where you will be at i forget if the canyon right behind your camp has a trickle of water of not but most of the canyonvalleys in that country have some water somewhere some of the time the main river will be very thickly silted with glacial silt of flour but there are some places just 100 yards from your base camp where clear water simply oozes up out of the ground in several small but usable seeps up high where the sheep are at you can almost always find a clear water seep you might have to fill your water bottle lidfull by lidfull i seldom pass up a good water source when sheep hunting sometimes water is everywhere other times not i have drank a bunch of glacial water over the years dont look at it it is easier to drink if you do not look at it but i have never suffered any strange effects or is it affects i personally drink alot of water unfiltered i will until i get sick someday i do have one friend who has had beaver fever three times i strongly dislike chlorine i do not dislike iodine

my speakers about 30 towards the centre of the room ponkine jun 25 2013 2 larry i forum resident location washington dc toe in is something one has to experiment to determine what is best toe in puts the listener more directly on axis to the drivers which will change the tonal balance the listener hears ususually brighter sounding when toed in toe in will also decrease the amount of signal that will bounce off the nearby side wall and this too affects tonal balance and imaging generally speaking with more toein the center image becomes more solid and focused but stage width will narrow this usually means a tradeoff between the two and one has to determine whether more width or if one needs a very wide listening area some chairs much nearer to one speaker than the other sometimes extreme toein the axis of the drivers crossing well in front of the center chair will help with imaging this is the case because the outside chair that is much closer to one speaker will also be much further off axis from that speaker and the far speaker will be more on axis so that closer proximity of one is somewhat compensated for by more direct and therefore louder sound by the other larry i jun 25

wide dispersion tweeters with my older amp i found i still needed to toe it in somewhat to make the soundstage feel cohesive now that i have upgraded to my cronus magnum i found that my soundstage was a bit hotter and vinyl noise was more noticeable so this weekend i was able to rearrange and increase the space between my speakers and listening position and left them with no toe in and it sounds much wider and the vinyl noise is now moved back to _rod_serling_ jun 25 2013 9 action pact forum resident location lexington massachusetts slight toein on my rega r1 bookshelfs optimized for the best

outside side my maggies are rather far apart and the toe in the speakers are angled slighty mor than directly at the listening position say about 2 feet in front of it the toe in is also to make the

can only get the best results by experimenting if we put my speakers in your listening room the toein amount that i use isnt necessarily what will work in your room also something else that ive found is just as essential is speaker height makes almost as big a difference as toein obviously floor standers are extremely limited in this respect but some of them can be slightly adjusted if they have screwin spikes if you dont have floor standers then use a bunch of books to find out what the best speaker height is for you do this after youve adjusted toein once youve got the correct height dialed in for your listening position then you can purchase speaker stands that match the correct height i think speaker height adjustment is more important based on how far away from the speakers you are if youre listening nearfield then it makes a huge difference bluemooze jun 26 2013 21 ellsworth likes this mwheelerk if you fly a flag of hate you aint no kin to me location my country tis of thee i dont

by room treatment as well if you have your side walls treated at the first reflection point then toe in should be less than untreated walls before i had treated my side walls i had my speakers toed in

    "text": "insider trading examining tipper and tippee liability by greg kramer gc new york may 9 2013 as discussed in a feb 14 2013 article by this author insider trading examining primary theories of liability insider trading has been a top enforcement priority for the securities and exchange commission and will most likely continue to be a top priority for the foreseeable future in fact the sec recently released a statistic that it has instituted more insider trading actions in the last three years than during any threeyear period in the agencys history among the recent sec enforcement actions cases involving tippers and tippees have featured prominently this article will focus on the standards of liability for tippers and tippees insider trading generally in brief illegal insider trading is trading while in possession of material nonpublic information in breach of a duty arising out of a fiduciary relationship or other relationship of trust and confidence there are two primary theories of insider trading liability the classical theory and misappropriation theory the classical theory which applies to insiders of a corporation provides that an insider breaches his or her duty of trust and confidence to the corporation and its shareholders when the insider trades on material nonpublic information learned by reason of his or her position with the corporation the misappropriation theory is a complement to the classical theory that applies to market participants other than corporate insiders under the misappropriation theory a person engages in illegal insider trading when he or she trades while in possession of material nonpublic information in breach of a duty owed to the source of information for purposes of the misappropriation theory such a duty may arise as a result of a fiduciary relationship such as an attorneyclient relationship or a result of an agreement one who has a fiduciary duty of trust and confidence to a corporation and its shareholders classical theory or to a source of confidential information misappropriation theory and is in receipt of material nonpublic information has a duty to abstain from trading in the absence of public disclosure of such information standards of liability under both the classical and misappropriation theories of insider trading tippers and tippees of material nonpublic information may face liability for insider trading the standards for liability under both theories generally overlap tipper liability requires that 1 the tipper had a duty to keep the material nonpublic information confidential and the tipper knew that the information was nonpublic and material or the tipper acted with reckless disregard of the nature of the information 2 the tipper breached that duty by intentionally or recklessly relaying the information to a tippee who could use the information in connection with securities trading and 3 the tipper received a personal benefit with respect to the tipping tippee liability requires that 1 the tipper breached a duty by tipping confidential information 2 the tippee knew or had reason to know that the tippee improperly obtained the information ie that the information was obtained through the tippers breach and 3 the tippee while in possession of the material nonpublic information used the information by trading or by tipping for a personal benefit the existence of the personal benefit mentioned above is a factspecific inquiry but it is broadly construed and is not limited to pecuniary benefit improvement of ones reputation with the tippee the positive emotions that result from helping out a friend or relative and the expectation of a continued business relationship have all been found to satisfy the personal benefit requirement also a tippee need not know definitively that the tipper disclosed the material nonpublic information in breach of a duty insider trading liability will attach if the tippee should have known of the tippers breach whether a tippee should have known of the tippers breach is a factspecific inquiry and an important factor may be the sophistication of the tippee financial professionals may be viewed as being particularly sophisticated tipping chains the analysis of tippertippee liability in tipping chains follows the same basic outline set forth above in a tipping chain the first tippee communicates the material nonpublic information to a second tippeethe so called remote tippeeand so on a tipper will be liable if he tips material nonpublic information in breach of a fiduciary duty to someone he knows will likely 1 trade on the information or 2 disseminate the information further for the first tippees own benefit the first tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained and transmitted through a breach of a fiduciary duty and intentionally or recklessly tip the information further for his or her own benefit the final tippee must both know or have reason to know that the information was obtained through a breach of a fiduciary duty and trade while in possession of the information in theory a tippee removed from the primary tipper by several links in the tipping chain could face insider trading liability tender offers the secs rule 14e3 governs insider trading in the context of tender offers rule 14e3a provides that if a bidder has taken a substantial step to commence a tender offer no other person who possesses material nonpublic information relating to the tender offer that was acquired directly or indirectly from the bidder the target company or any insider or other person acting on behalf of the bidder or the target company can buy or sell the target companys securities unless the material nonpublic information is publicly disclosed note that there is no requirement under rule 14e3 that the trader be rule 14e3d also prohibits tipping of material nonpublic information regarding a tender offer to third parties the bidder the target company and insiders and other persons acting on behalf of the bidder or the target company are prohibited from communicating material nonpublic information relating to a tender offer to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such communication is likely to result in a violation of rule 14e3a in addition any person in possession of material information relating to a tender offer that is nonpublic and that he or she knows or has reason to know has been acquired directly or indirectly from any of the foregoing persons is also prohibited from tipping such information said slightly differently a tippee who further tips violates rule 14e3d situations the need to address insider trading issues may come up in a number of different circumstances during the course of an investors due diligence of an investment as part of information gathering an investor may inadvertently receive material nonpublic information that could expose the investor to insider trading liability as a tippee the following are some examples of situations in which an investor may unintentionally acquire material nonpublic information gathering information from company representatives directors officers and employees of a public company are frequently in possession of material nonpublic information regarding their own company and their customers suppliers and competitors directors officers and employees of a company as well as temporary insiders such as lawyers accountants and financial advisors almost always have a duty of trust and confidence to the company company representatives may be in breach of such duty when they share confidential information with outsiders talking to investment bankers and sell side firms such as brokers investment bankers and brokers are often in possession of material nonpublic information and other confidential information regarding their clients and may have duties of trust and confidence to their clients and the financial services firms that employ the investment bankers and brokers talking to other market participants and representatives of buy side investors such as analysts and portfolio managers at hedge funds information about a buy side investors plans to purchase or sell securities or other plans with respect to a security may constitute material nonpublic information for example information about a buy side investors plans to liquidate a large position representatives of buy side investors are usually subject to duties of trust and confidence to the firms that employ them and may not be authorized to discuss confidential information with outsiders use of expert networks expert networks are firms that connect buy side investors with industry experts the industry experts may be current or former senior employees of or consultants to public companies or current or former government officials these industry experts may be in possession of material nonpublic information and subject to duties of trust and confidence investors should not assume that the industry experts are properly trained with respect to insider trading compliance or know that they should not share material nonpublic information in general investors should make clear to the expert that they are not seeking a tip since the expert will be compensated an investor should disclaim that he or she is seeking information the disclosure of which would cause the expert to violate a duty to a third party conclusions certain recent sec enforcement actions demonstrate that even casual disclosures of material nonpublic information between friends risk drawing regulatory scrutiny if the recipient of the information trades or further disseminates the information to someone who does trade individuals who are entrusted with material nonpublic information such as employees and other representatives of public companies investment bankers and brokers as well as investors who engage in information gathering must take care to avoid becoming inadvertent tippers and tippees investors financial firms and public companies need to be aware of insider trading laws properly train and educate employees concerning insider trading compliance greg kramer is a partner in the corporate and securities practice areas of kleinberg kaplan wolff cohen",

northern gulf photo credit primofishcom scientific name pterois volitans common names red lionfish common lionfish butterfly cod turkey fish fire fish order scorpaeniformes family scorpaenidae conservation status not evaluated by the international union for conservation of nature and natural resources iucn considered an undesirable invasive species in the us bahamas and the caribbean note pterois volitans and pterois miles a closely related sister species were once thought to be a single species it is difficult to distinguish between the two without dna analysis pterois volitans is the more common in atlantic and caribbean waters accounting for approximately 93 of the invasive lionfish population description red lionfish photo credit brian gratwicke the red lionfish is a scorpionfish in the family scorpaenidae they are conspicuous for their elongated feathery fins bold patterning and behavior adults reach a length of about 185 inches 47 cm and a weight of 26 lbs 12 kg like other scorpionfish the red lionfish has has large feathery fins that protrude from the body suggesting the mane of a male lion spiny projections on the head and venomous spines in the dorsal anal and pelvic fins make the fish less desirable to potential predators numerous fleshy tabs on the head may mimic algal growth to camouflage the fish while coloration varies red lionfish are characterized by bold narrow vertical bands of red maroonor redbrown alternating with broader white or yellowish bands the fins are spotted male and female red lionfish are similar in appearance and show distinct traits only during courtship and breeding red lionfish are slowmoving and behave as if they are extremely confident or indifferent to threats they rely on their coloration camouflage and poisonous spines to deter predators adults are solitary and tend to remain in one location for long periods they will fiercely defend their home range against other lionfish and other species they congregate in small groups only as juveniles and during breeding season your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video lionfish have not been widely exploited as a commercial species but are very popular as aquarium fish releases of aquarium fish who have grown too large may account for the introduction of lionfish into new areas in popular culture fictional red lionfish have appeared in the aquarium of captain jeanluc picards ready room in star trek the next generation and in the aquarium of the villain who challenges james bond in the spy who loved me occurrence red lionfish photo credit us geological service the native range of the red lionfish is the western pacific ocean and eastern indian ocean the similar pterois miles occurs in area between the red sea and sumatra typical red lionfish habitat is described as near and offshore coral and rocky reefs to depths of about 165 feet 50 meters however in their natural range they also appear in shallow coastal and estuarine waters with the highest population densities being in shallower inshore waters large adults have also been observed at depths of 1000 300 meters in the open ocean lionfish are said to be primarily nocturnal preferring to shelter under ledges or crevices during the day however daylight activity and feeding are also common life cycle reproduction lionfish have a prodigious reproductive capacity they reach sexual maturity is less than a year and spawn yearround in warmer waters females can spawn as often as every three to four days females produce 15 to 30 thousand eggs per batch so that a single fish in warm waters can produce as many as two million eggs per year during breeding one male may associate with several females the coloration of the male darkens and its stripes become less distinct while females become paler spawning occurs near the surface with males immediately fertilizing the released eggs the eggs hatch in about 36 hours and may spend 30 days in a pelagic stage allowing them to disperse widely on ocean currents this characteristic has facilitated the rapid expansion of their range in the altantic and caribbean larval fish are good swimmers and begin feeding on small ciliate protozoa just four days after conception juvenile fish grow rapidly as much as the typical red lionfish is thought to live for around 10 years though captive specimens have survived for as long as 35 years feeding the red lionfish is one of the apex predators in the coral reef environment and they are described as robust generalists in their feeding they consume small fish shrimp crabs and other invertebrates typically smaller than 4 inches 10 cm in length lionfish feed in a solitary manner approaching their prey slowly finally seizing it in a lightning quick lunge and snap of the jaws and swallowing it whole your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video lionfish exhibit two interesting feeding behaviors they spread their long feathery pectoral fins to form a visual barrier and herd small fish into a confined space so that they are easier to capture even more unusual is their use of water jets in capturing prey the lionfish approaches the prey slowly and directs jets of water at the prey there are two potential explanations for how this might benefit the lionfish one is that the prey attempts to align itself with the moving water and is thus easier to capture and swallow head first the other is that the turbulence of the water jet confuses the preys sensory systems a video of this behavior is available on the interresearch science center website animated map of red lionfish report from 1985 through 2013 source usgs reef and noaa via gulf and caribbean fisheries institute animated version from the reef website the lionfish invasion dr mark albins who conducted a seminar on red lionfish at gcrl on october 10 2013 described the red lionfish as the perfect superinvader red lionfish reproduce rapidly grow rapidly disperse readily on ocean currents tolerate a variety of habitats and have few natural controls many species of fish and invertebrates that are preyed upon by invasive lionfish do not recognize the oddlooking newcomers as threats see the progress of the lionfish invasion from 1985 through 2013 in the animated map on the right lionfish are thriving in their new range they grow about one quarter larger than in their native range and their population densities can be five times greater it is thought that red lionfish arrived in the us waters either by releases from hobbyist aquariums or in the ballast water of ships the earliest reported sighting occurred in south florida in 1985 they have spread at an astonishing rate along the us east and gulf coasts and throughout the caribbean the map of reported red lionfish captures on the right shows the rapid expansion of their invasive range from 1985 through 2013 invasive lionfish populations have grown about 67 per year field experiments have shown that lionfish can quickly displace 80 of the native fish populations on coral the red lionfishs sister species pterois miles comprises about 7 of the invasive population to date pterois miles occurs as an invasive primarily on the eastern seaboard of the us lionfish populations are established as far north as cape hatteras and juvenile fish have been found in new york and rhode island low water temperatures during winter probably prevent the fish from overwintering in northern regions this lionfish invasion is raising major concerns about the impacts of red lionfish on native hardbottom mangrove seagrass and coral reef communities and even on estuarine habitats the concern is not only the direct predation of the lionfish on native fishes and competition with native fish for food sources but cascading effects throughout the entire ecosystem for example what effect might a significant reduction in the number of cleaner fish have on fish populations who depend on them how will corals fare if lionfish remove a significant portion of the herbivorous fish whose feeding helps keep seaweeds and algas from predators and natural controls few natural predators of red lionfish have been documented even in their natural range it is not well understood how lionfish populations in their native range are kept in check they appear to be less affected by external parasites than other fish both in their native range and their invasive range within their invasive range it is likely that sharks and other larger piscivorous fish eating fish have not yet recognized lionfish as prey however it is encouraging that lionfish have been found in the stomachs of groupers in the bahamas human control of invasive lionfish is not likely to provide an overall or longterm eradication or control option however it may be possible to control the population of lionfish in limited selected areas by regular removal efforts defense mechanisms danger to humans scorpionfishes including the red lionfish earn their common name with their ability to defend themselves with a sting or stab from venom delivered via spines in their fins lionfish are among the most venomous of all fishes the red lionfish have venomous spines in their dorsal anal and pelvic fins lionfish should be handled carefully an envenomation is a serious medical issue in humans the venom causes intense pain and inflammation serious systemic symptoms such as respiratory distress abdominal pain seizures and loss of consciousness may also occur a lionfish sting is rarely fatal though some people are more susceptible to the venom than others one source suggests that scorpionfishes as a group rank second only to stingrays in total number of envenomations with 40000 50000 instances per year noaa recommends treating a puncture wound by immersing the wound area in hot water other sources suggest 113 f or 45 c for 30 to 90 minutes as first aid followed by prompt attention from a

    "text": "home for consumers education and prevention mental health publications risk and protective factors the approaches considered so far generally take a singular emphasis for intervention for example interventions to improve compliance with medication prioritise a medical approach a cognitive view is adopted in the case of cbt interventions and social and educational viewpoints are emphasised for selfhelp programs it is argued however that a single model of intervention is not sufficient and that there are major advantages to more comprehensive and holistic approaches that respond to multiple areas of intervention need eg kramer et al 2003 a more holistic approach to prevention focuses on identifying the multiple risk and protective factors for mental health risk factors are those that contribute to a persons vulnerability to relapse whereas protective factors mitigate against relapse by enhancing wellbeing risk factors increase the likelihood that a disorder will develop and can exacerbate the burden of existing disorder while protective factors give people resilience in the face of adversity and moderate the impact of stress and transient symptoms on social and emotional wellbeing thereby reducing the likelihood of disorders monograph 2000 p13 evidence related to the risk and protective factors for relapse of mental illness is an area of much needed research activity stress is commonly implicated in exacerbating mental illness eg ventura et al 1989 in particular longerterm stressors in a persons social and physical environment and lack of opportunities for fresh starts are factors that are likely to increase the likelihood of relapse and impede recovery brown et al 1988 paykel et al 2001 risk and protective factors occur through income and social status physical environments education and educational settings working conditions social environments families biology and genetics personal health practices and coping skills sport and recreation the availability of opportunities as well as through access to health services action plan 2000 p9 lists of potential risk and protective factors are provided in monograph 2000 pp1516 which cautions however that it is important to note that while the available evidence shows that these factors are associated with mental health outcomes the strength of association and level of evidence for causation varies consequently no causal relationship can be assumed for these factors for some individuals there will be no impact of any particular factor or combination of factors while for other people a particular factor or combination of factors may have a major impact on their ongoing mental health importantly monograph 2000 p34 points out that it is possible that quite different factors influence the relapse and recurrence of disorder compared with those that influence its onset zubrick et al 2000a for example a determinant of the onset of conduct disorder in children may be poor fetal growth zubrick et al 2000b breslau 1995 while determinants of the persistence of this disorder at the time a clinician sees the child may be poor parental monitoring and a deviant peer group national crime prevention 1999 these latter determinants form part of the prognosis for treatment and need to be considered as targets for relapse prevention while the former determinant now no longer amenable to treatment is an early risk factor and target for indicated prevention top of page clearly all the domains of lifeenvironmental physical social and emotionalcan be a source of both strength and stress varying levels of evidence suggest that risk and protective factors are likely to be evident in the areas of accommodation employment forms of meaningful activity harmful alcohol and other drug use physical health social relationships violence and factors that shape personal resilience a word of caution is required regarding the implementation of relapse prevention in terms of applying a riskbased approach monograph 2000 presents the following potential problems of such an approach firstly risk factors have limitations as predictive tools the extent to which any particular risk factor contributes to an episode of mental illness is not certain as risk is based on probability not everyone who is exposed to a risk factor will have an adverse outcome knowledge related to the risks for relapse is not yet well developed and it is important to realise the limitations of our understanding in this area furthermore the nature of risk varies in terms of the element of choice or voluntariness of the risk factors identified which affects the extent to which the risk is amenable to intervention the canadian association of gerontology see health canada 1997 p8 identifies personal risks on a continuum of voluntary choice as follows risk pursued as opportunity freely accepted risk reluctantly assumed risk risk with little or no choice thirdly monograph 2000 states that the process of identifying risk can be biased risk is not a neutral concept decisions regarding what are acceptable or unacceptable levels of risk are subjective the generalized use of the at risk label is highly problematic and implicitly racist classist sexist and a 1990s version of the cultural deficit model which located problems or pathologies in individuals families and communities rather than in institutions and structures that create and maintain inequality swadener lubeck 1995 p3 the process of ascribing risk can be disempowering for consumers as the assessment of risk factors is often carried out by services asking people themselves what is important for their wellbeing can generate factors very different to those determined by a service provider interventions can be paternalistic and at odds with the concepts of consumer empowerment and participation you can put too much emphasis on relapse prevention and theres the risk of trying to be too overprotective you can highlight vulnerability to the extent that it kind of restricts peoples sense of wellbeing clinician risk factors interact and multiple and persistent risk factors predict more strongly than any individual risk factor mrazek haggerty 1994 fraser 1997 addressing a single risk factor or having a shortterm orientation to prevention is likely to be ineffective these types of simplistic approaches are all too common and derive from and underlie the fragmented sectorspecific nature of many services structural barriers can hinder intersectoral approaches and impede more multifocused holistic and intersectoral prevention interventions if risks are improperly identified interventions can be targeted at the wrong factors at best such interventions may be ineffective and a waste of scarce resources at worst they may exacerbate other risk factors an example of an intervention that may increase risk is the premature removal of children from their families in response to perceived risk and placing them in foster care or institutions the stolen generation of aboriginal children resulted from a biased misguided paternalistic and racist decision to remove partaboriginal children from the risks associated with growing up within aboriginal communities and instead provide them with the the overzealous application of a risk approach is all too well understood by parents who have mental illness these people risk the removal of their children when they become acutely unwell and then may have difficulty getting them back once they are well again top of page docs doesnt consider mental illness its outside of their act if they get involved the children just disappear consumer you learn to make sure they the children dont get noticed consumer finally a risk approach focuses on the negative a risk focus concentrates on weaknesses rather than strengths and can encourage an approach akin to rescuing those in need alternatively there is a danger that enforced intervention will be seen as desirable or even necessary while it is important to reduce risk factors where possible and enable people to better cope with the risk factors that they can not modify a concomitant focus

installation tuesday january 6 2015 how to increase the configmgr client cache on existing and new systems by default the configmgr client cache on systems is 5120mb which is 5gb when deploying lot of packages this isnt enough for sure because content remains in the cache for at least 24 hours it can not be overwritten by new content if it requires the space when its needed to deploy more then 5gb within 24 hours the client cache must be expanded or cleaned up when the client must download new packages you can either increase the client cache size or choose the delete option within the control panel applet of the client to delete contents of the cache lets have a look at the possibilities expand the configmgr client cache manually you can change this setting directly on the client itself using the control panel applet cache configure settings expand the configmgr client cache on existing systems just create a package with vbs file to change cache size on error resume next dim

    "text": "german concentration camps vittel internment camp france figure 1the allies reached the vittel internees on september 13 the press caption here reads yank entertains youthful internees pfc eldon nicholas of vadillac mich uses a toy monkey to entertain a few of the nore youthful of the 1500 internees of the german internment camp at vittel in the vosges moiutains of france the internees citizens of the united states england and other allied nations were released after the arrival pf french troops from gen pattons third army the germans would attempt to make a stand in the rugged vosges mountains the germans after their victory in france set up an internment camp at a spa resort near epinal at vittel france it was located in the vogues mountains of northeastern france this proved to be a rather privlidged camp vittel was one of several internierunslager ilaq administerd by the german army rather than the ss it was part of the pow camp system although it was not for pows they were for allied civilians british and dominion subjects who had the misfortune to find themselves in areas occupied by the germans by far the greatest number of allied civilians in fall of france june 1940 france during world war i had been the bulwark against the german army in the west few believed that grance could be easily defeated included the grear majority of the lading german commanders many saw the french army as the strongest in the world large mumbers of forign narionals libed in france many in paris paris was called the city of lights it was renowned for its toleration culture and beauty here were sunstantial numbers of american citizens and british subjcts iving it france enjoying the cultjure food and pleasant climate when war broke out september 1939 many but not arrest of foreign nationals the germans after their victory in france began arresting allied nationals they were at first placed in pow camps not special camps conditions were apparently dplorable after the british managed to defeat the luftwaffe in the battle of britain and prevent a quick germany victory a more permanent arrangement was needed and the british began learning of the poor conditions their civilians were subjected to one report suggests that the british thratened to send interned german civilins to northern canada the germans established an internment camp in the resort town of vittel united states civilian detainees joined them in 1942 establishment may 1941 the germans decided to set up a special internment camp 1941 they chose a spa resort near epinal at vittel france it was located in the vogues mountains of northeastern france the first group of detainees arrived may 1 1941 they were a mixed group of some 2060 women children and elderly civilians most were british vittel proved to be a rather privlidged camp internierunslager ilaq vittel was one of several internierunslager ilaq administerd by the german army rather than the ss it was designated frontstalag 121 vittel was thus part of the german pow camp system administered by the wehrmacht while part of the pow camp system it was not for pows they were special camps for allied civilians british and dominion subjects who had the misfortune to find themselves in areas occupied by the germans by far the greatest number of allied civilians in german hands were in france after hitler declared war on the united states some americans were also held there there conditions vittel frontstalag 121 consisted of requisitioned hotels in this spa town vittel differed significantly from the vast mjority of other camps living conditions were far better in addition to the hotels there was a large park the internees had access to the hotels and parks were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by armed guards the internees while living in hotels did their own cooking unlike the sitution in most german camps there was heat and running water as with the pow camps for western soldiers the civilian internees at vittel were allowed to send and receive mail and like gestapo the wehrmacht not the ss was responsible for the camp we arevnot entirely sure of the security arrangements we notice that some of the internees report their luggage upon arrival was searched by gestapo agents glass we are not sure if they were really gestapo or other police organization or wehrmacht security officers but because the difference between wehrmacht and police uniforms it seems likely that there was some police involvement as far as we can tell the intenees were not subjected to any brutal treatment release of elderly and youth early 1942 the germans eventually decided to release women over 60 years men over 75 years and children under 16 years early1942 thus did not mean that children were released young children remained at the camp because their parents were being held at the camp this mean that the germans were releaved of the cost for looking after them they were allowed to live in occupied france where they found that comditions were worse then in the camp population the release of the elderly and youth in 1942 reduced the camp population to about 2400 internees most survived the war because conditions in the camp were relatively good german interest in exchanges the germans as the war continued became increasinly interested in securing the release of germans interned in foreign countries after the fall of france june 1940 this meant britain and the commonwealth the only unoccupied countries still at war with germany this changed with the the nazi invasion of the soviet union june 1941 and declration of war on he united states december 1941 suddenly substantial numbers of countries began breaking relations andor declaring war on germany in latin america and the number of interned germans abroad begn to oncrease we are not sure hitler was concerned about this but jews january 1943 there were also jews at vittel mostly german jews including many children the germans at first used the camp to intern british and american citizens who were living in france this was a result of ribentrops effort to exchange civilian internees he did not have many allied internnes to exchange so he came up with the idea of collecting jews with foreign passprts to add to his numbers he persuaded himmler s the ss began the mass killings in poland to send jews with foreign passports to vittel unlike the british and americans the jews mostly came from gettoes in some 200 jews arrived at vittel from poland january 1943 another 60 arrived may 1943 most held foreign passports or promises of citizenship obtained from latin american countries other jews with foreign passports arrived from france and other germanoccupied countries in western europe these jews were kept separate from the western internees but enjoyed similar living conditions without exception it was vast improvemnt ovr wht they had been enduring ribbentrop failed to arrange exchanges tragically latin american countries showed little interest in such exchanges the henerally refused to honor the citizenship papers issued to jews by their consulates nor did liberation september 1944 unlike the ss camps wehrmacht commanders at vittel made no effort to evacuate the camp as the allies approached free french forces were an important part of the forces that lnded in southern france as part of operation dragoon and they expanded as the french resitance joined them as they moved north and became part of the right flank of the allied forces liberating france thus the free french were part of the allied forces that moved into the vosges mountains driving toward the rhine this it was the free french that liberated vittel september 12 1944 individual accounts we note one pot about vittel my father and his sister and brother and his father were interned at the vittel concentration campthey were cuban jews living in paris and were sent to vittel they suffered and lost everything and were eventually traded for german soldiers imprisoned in cuba they were sent to spain and then another 2 years went by and they finally arrived in cuba the rest

multiplayer stats attack 60 bonus 15 chain 5 speed 5 raidriar in infinity blade 1 raidriar raid ree are born as jori also known as the god king is the main antagonist of infinity blade i and ii and the tritagonist of infinity blade iii after ausars fall he ruled most of the planet together with a pantheon of seven deathless of which he was the leader he does not live in the temple of lantimor found in infinity blade i but only comes there when the next descendant of the bloodline is ready to face him he most likely lives in his stronghold at larioth as revealed in infinity blade iii contents show history early life not much is known about raidriars early life other than thousands of years ago he was known as jori the son of a man named uriel who worked for a corporate businessman known as mr galath he and his father were never close because of uriels timeconsuming job when jori was hit by a car uriel brought him to galath who used his advanced knowledge of the qip and machinery to transform jori into a deathless at some point in his immortal life he hunted down ausar the vile and managed to defeat him under mysterious circumstances though most likely by luckchance obtaining the infinity blade in the process he then formed the pantheon and took control of the world with no one left to challenge him infinity blade the god king is the enemy of the final battle of each bloodline he is reborn every time he is destroyed after obtaining the infinity blade siris may access the dungeon which leads to a rebirth chamber with several raidriar buds in green tubes without the helio armor shoulder guards raidriar uses the infinity blade helio helm sunstorm and helio armor he increases by 50 levels every time he is defeated siris is able to obtain all raidriars armor and weapons once raidriars health is reduced by one third he will disarm siris and offer him a chance to learn the true meaning of power if the player taps the weapon the fight continues and raidriar will now unleash his fury attacks after defeating raidriar siris drops his shield and sword and disarms raidriar raidriar then says they will come for siris next and he kills raidriar after this the credits roll and then another cut scene starts siris looks around the room before approaching the raidriars throne where he presses a button that activates a giant hologram machine the machine saydhi for going too far after this the credits roll and the next bloodline starts infinity blade awakening raidriar was reborn in his seventh temple of reincarnation after siris had defeated him in battle he claims that he allowed siris to defeat him he is referred to as raidriar by his devoted mortals that serve him raidriar uses technology only available to the deathless to learn how he lost the duel against siris raidriar learns that the infinity blade was not fully activated when he lost however it was powerful enough to kill the lesser deathless that were imprisoned in his dungeon raidriar believes that the infinity blade may be fully activated now and is terrified by the thought of a true death raidriar reviews the video of his isa who initially attempts to kill siris and retrieve the blade raidriar gathers several dark knights and sets out to meet with the worker of secrets as siris learns of the god kings rebirth he sets out with isa to find another deathless saydhi that can help siris find the worker of secrets after siris kills saydhi he inserts the infinity blade in a slot similar to the one in raidriars dungeon causing siris to lose possession of the infinity blade and raidriar to gain it he tells siris of their intertwined past siris is actually ausar who is deathless himself infinity blade ii raidriar in infinity blade 2 in infinity blade ii it is revealed by the worker of secrets and the archivist that the god kings true name is raidriar and ausar siris can only free the worker by trapping raidriar in his place when siris arrives at saydhis estate he challenges raidriar to a duel shouting his name and waiting for him to arrive the latter arrives with a plated guard an iron butcher and an iron sentinel he commands his minions to best siris but not to kill him instead saving him for the infinity blade siris survives and faces the god king himself siris then bests him raidriar reveals that killing him will not end siris goal to free mankind from the deathless siris then hits raidriar with the pommel of the blade and brings him back to saranthia to free the worker however the worker betrays siris thanking him for defeating raidriar his rival and revealing that siris as ausar at the time was actually the one who imprisoned him and tricks siris into imprisonment infinity blade redemption raidriar and siris are imprisoned for two years during which they kill each other thousands of times when isa finally rescues siris raidriar surprises them slitting his throat in order to escape raidriar awakens back in his castle learning that the worker has instated a soulless copy of raidriar in his stead forced to kill his own devoted who believe he is an imposter raidriar seeks out his stillloyal high devoted eves and sets out to find siris convincing siris that they must ally raidriar sends him to kill the false god king and retrieve the infinity blade while siris is away the worker of secrets bombs the camps of siris rebellion killing almost everyone siris returns and is eventually persuaded to give raidriar the infinity blade so that he can seek out the worker and end him raidriar reaches the workers bunker and fights his way to his throne it is revealed that raidriar is jori uriels son and that the worker of secrets is galath after killing jarred with his infinity blade raidriar faces galath who summons his own infinity blade and bests raidriar the worker then reveals his plan to destroy the world so that all deathless can die permanently but tells raidriar that he will never defeat him and offers him a chance to join him telling him that he can be a valuable asset thinking back on his fathers final words to him to make the world better instead of accepting galaths offer raidriar teleports the datapod to a hidden location sending a remote message to siris to seek it out galath angered stabs raidriar infinity blade iii raidriar is playable during the prologue of infinity blade iii at the beginning of infinity blade iii raidriar reaches the worker in his tower he fights and beats one of the workers minions and ashimar he then faces the worker himself whether the player is defeated or should the player deal enough damage the battle will end with raidriars submission the worker then reveals his plan to destroy the world so that all deathless can die permanently the worker tells raidriar that he will never defeat him and offers him a chance to join him telling him that he can be a valuable asset in response raidriar admits that he siris raidriar instead of accepting the workers offer removes his datapod alerting siris and isa and angering the worker causing him to strike raidriar with the infinity blade killing him permanently presumably the worker makes a second soulless copy of raidriar as the first was killed by siris in infinity blade redemption the magic stats raidriar has is heal 3 incinerate 3 and freeze 3 it matches that of the magic stats of ring of ice and fire this is a reference to infinity blade ii where siris uses the same ring in the tutorial donald mustard has implied that raidriar is truly dead as he said i saw him raidriar get stabbed with an activated infinity blade soulless raidriar main article soulless raidriar during infinity blade iii it is shown that the soulless version of raidriar is ruling the land from raidriars stronghold in larioth he fights siris but as siris is about to kill him he kills himself teleporting away later in the ark he attempts to cover the worker while he escapes but isa takes care of him while siris pursues galath tactics infinity blade i before battling the god king the player is advised to equip a weapon with the most raw damage they have available to them as the god king becomes immune to almost all elemental attacks after only a few bloodlines its also advised that the player not rush in to fight him as his weapons elemental attack changes often equip shields that add resistances to those elements its also highly advised to have a decent magic attribute coupled with a ring with healing properties and remember to heal fully with a health potion its highly advised that the player stick to parrying the god kings standard attacks because the small windows from block and dodge breaks wont provide a good opportunity to dish out damage at all when the god king gets cut down by 13 of his health he gives you a choice to join him or die if you choose to serve him by tapping on him hell praise you for your wisdom and a secret achievement not in kansas will be unlocked by tapping on your weapon he will become angered and start to attack more aggressively by now using after the fight the player will be taken on to the next bloodline regardless of results if he has beaten the god king he will raise his level by 50 however if the player has lost the battle the god king shall remain at his current level the god king drops a significant though leveldependant amount of gold and a guaranteed item it should be noted that the god king will rarely drop the infinity blade as he always drop gold or random things infinity blade ii raidriar fights similar to any other normalsized enemy but with faster movements he also has three unique fury combos all of which include unblockable moves it is recommended to parry these combos before he can execute them if you can an alternative solution is to obtain a on 4combo block all attacks gem for light weapon class which will allow you to block his shield bashes in the fury chains the vault of tears update allows raidriar to fire off light magic much like saydhi and thane you can parry dodge or at a cost to 5 odd units of damage to your shieldtwo handed weapon block these attacks take note even if raidriar fires magic to the left or right of your character you must dodge to the opposite side to avoid taking damage it is also recommended that you at least create a rare defense gem to shrug off his attack element whichever that element is if he is at a very high level stick with anything that is extremely high in stats like the infinity blade heavy weapons can also be effective if you dialogue infinity blade i prologue raidriar welcome it has been many centuries since a mortal has dared challenge me i commend you for your bravery tell me hero what do you call yourself sirisfirst ancestor i am the voice of freedom and i will end your tyranny and bring peace to this land raidriar mwahaha a bold reply and one of the most entertaining ive yet heard you will do nicely begin tutorial ends raidriar enough you are a cunning warrior and fight with strength and skill we have found our catalyst summons the infinity blade the infinity blade the god killer it took me millennia to find this to unravel its secrets finally after all this time i can begin stabs ancestor raidriar the blade has tasted your blood and now contains your essence your prowess ah a strong bloodline indeed your progeny will serve me well talks to the dark knight continue to seed the legends call upon me when the bloodline has matured again and i will return in the coming storm this blade is our only hope of dominion face the god king raidriar most impressive you have defeated my champions but now you face the true test jumps from his throne prepare to meet your doom reduce god kings health by 13 raidriar grraah of all those who dared to face me you are the first to prove worthy so i offer you a choice noble warrior join me and learn the true meaning of power you need not perish this day join the god king raidriar excellent you have chosen wisely i was once a mere mortal as you are now but as you will come to learn there are more powerful beings in this world than i deathless ones who have grown too powerful too corrupt together we will vanquish them all fight the god king raidriar impudent child how dare you refuse the will of the deathless you will now feel the full power of my wrath defeated by the god king raidriar knocks siris back no mere mortal can defeat one of the deathless grabs siris had you been a more worthy adversary you might have made a valuable ally but no matter stabs siris instead you will serve another purpose perhaps your descendants will fare better note if you are defeated at the bottom of the stairs he does not say the line no mere mortal can defeat one of the deathless defeat the god king raidriar gwaugh impossible i am immortal you cough you dont know what youve done this world contains far greater danger than you could imagine cough theyll be coming for you now note the dialogue of infinity blade ii and iii is spoken in english in infinity blade i the dialogue is in pangean but the subtitles are in english dialogue in ib2 tap the obelisk raidriar yes i thought you might fall for that cuts to raidriar with the dark knight you opened the pathway to my dungeons after all i do believe she was planning on taking the sword and betraying me a pity but i suppose you did me a favor by killing her siris i so you do still live then you know what i am you sought out my lineage raidriar oh i know what you are though im more and more certain that you do not raises the infinity blade thank you for returning this to me siris give me a sword fight me raidriar i think not you surprised me last time i dont think ill put myself in that position again prepares to stab siris you really dont know who you are do you ironic what did you do to yourself ausar approaching siriss trap raidriar so you return ausar mwahahaha oh ever the fool you wont escape me again to his fodder henchtitans take him but be sure to leave the killing blow for my blade after defeating raidriars last knight raidriar i have killed you hundreds of times but now finally you will truly taste death ausar siris we shall see defeated by raidriar raidriar grabs siris oh ever the fool you wont escape me again stabs siris and drops him on the ground afterwards laughing defeat raidriar raidriar you always were a vile plotting wretch ausar panting killing me will not end this you know grunting siris what makes you think i will let you die that easily knocks raidrair down with infinity blade notes in infinity blade iis negative bloodlines raidriar equips the same gear as in infinity blade i this version of the god king is called the classic god king in infinity blade i if you choose to join raidriar instead of a new bloodline beginning after the credits you fight him again if this is your first time doing so then you will get the hidden achievement not in kansas in the final cutscenes after defeating raidriar siris approaches his throne he finds a small electronic device revealed to be a datapod in ib3 perhaps a reference to the apple iphone siris taps it and backs away futuristic hologram projectors then protrude from the ceiling and display a hologram of the planet infinity blade takes place but with a destroyed moon the moon was later called heaven in infinity blade iii in infinity blade ii raidriar uses similar armor to the worker of secrets albeit a different color scheme different helmet and few pieces of black cloth on his waist raidriar in infinity blade i is relatively harder than the raidriar in the second game since he has faster fury moves and stronger attacks than in infinity blade ii donald mustard stated in an interview that at full power raidriar stands no chance against ausar the vile preredemption even though he is considered to be the best swordsman in the present era this leads to the question of how raidriar defeated ausar at the plains of koroth and also foreshadows his defeat against the worker of secrets ryth a famed duelist has also been able to defeat raidriar comprehensively within twenty seconds of their duel gallery a front and back shot of raidriar raidriar greets the first ancestor raidriar offers you a choice ib2 final duel the god king killing siris raidriar on his throne raidriar slain by siris the classic god king in infinity blade ii soulless raidriar and the worker of secrets raidriar in the prologue raidriar killed by the worker of secrets with the infinity blade raidriar teleports the

on the weekend of the allireland hurling final it seems only fitting that the history of irelands national game are discussed hurling is arguably the fastest field sport in the world and quite possibly the oldest it is played with sticks called hurleys a ball known as a sliotar and by two teams of 15 who play on a large pitch with goals at either end the rules of the modern game were first codified by the gaelic athletic association in the late 19 th century but prior to this there were actually two hurling traditions on the island of ireland see omaolfabhail 1973 in the north of the country a winter game very similar to modern scottish shinty was played mainly on the ground with a narrow stick and a hard ball the second form of the game or leinster hurling was played with a broader hurley and a softer ball and was much more like the modern game players could pick up the ball catch and strike it as well as soloing down the field although the gaa used both forms as an martin driscoll martindriscollcom the earliest surviving references to hurling are found in 7 th and 8 th century ad irish laws which describe various sporting injuries that should be compensated hurling is also mentioned in the 11 th 12 th century leabhar na huidre while further descriptions are to be found in 13 th 14 th century romantic tale cath mhaigh tuireadh chunga ibid p33 this latter account details a very bloody hurling game between the tuatha de danna and the fir bolg that was played at moytura co mayo this mythical match supposedly took place in 1072 bc the bronze age however the most famous early account of the hurling is found in the tain bo cuailgne which describes the exploits of the ulster hero cu chullainn although the surviving version of this epic dates from the 12 th century it has been convincingly argued that the storys origins lie in the iron age 500 bc 400 ad hurling is mentioned a number of times in the text most notably when the young hero then known as setanta uses a hurley and sliotar to kill a vicious hound hence forth he became known as cu chulainn cullens hound after the owner of the dog kells high cross possible representations of hurling are also found on two high crosses from kells and monsterboice which date from 9 th 10 th centuries ad on each of these crosses a biblical panel is depicted which illustrates david killing a lion with what appears to be a curved stick and ball the killing instrument should in fact be a sling but it appears that a hurley was chosen instead as it may have been more familiar to an irish audience osullivan 1998 34 hurling continues to feature in later medieval gaelic irish and english sources with the latter generally disapproving it is hard to believe it now but in the 14 th century that bastion of the modern game killkenny attempted to ban hurling this occurred in 1367 when the infamous statutes of kilkenny declared do not henceforth use the plays which men call horlings with great sticks and a ball upon the ground from which great evils and maims have arisen despite threats of fines and imprisonment this law failed miserably and the blackandamberclad men of kilkenny would become one of hurlings powerhouses similar measures to curtail hurling were also undertaken in galway these statutes which were enacted in 1527 stated that people should at no time to use ne occupy ye hurling of ye litill balle with the hookie sticks or staves thankfully as in kilkenny these laws seem to have had little lasting effect galloglass grave slab jim dempsey deb snelson megalithicirelandcom indeed the game appears to have been widely played in the latter middle ages in the far north of the country for example a 15 th century galloglasss grave slab from co donegal clearly depicts a sword hurley and sliotar see image to the left similarly in the south of the country hurling was so prevalent that the lord chancellor william gerrarde was forced to reprimand the english settlers of the munster plantation for playing the game in 1587 in the postmedieval period hurling continued to prosper often under the patronage of the angloirish gentry these matches drew large crowds and many colourful accounts of these games survive for example in 1792 a hurling match took place in the phoenix park dublin in front of a vast concourse of spectators with much agility and athletic contention until the spectators forced into the playing ground king 2005 p 18 similarly in 1827 a game at callan co kilkenny is described thus it was a good game the sticks were being brandished like swords hurling is a warlike game the west side won the first match and the east the second you could hear the sticks striking the ball from one end of the green to the other diaries of amhlaoibh o suilleabhain intervillage and sometimes intercounty hurling matches flourished throughout the 19 th century indeed they were to inspire a new and dynamic sporting organisation in 1884

    "text": "4 utterance boundaries determining where the boundaries fall between utterances is an important part of your job as a transcriber lots of segments of speech qualify as utterances a word a short phrase or a complex sentence with many embedded clauses unfortunately people dont speak with periods commas and question marks to let you know when one utterance ends and another one begins the following guidelines have been developed to help you break continuous human speech into single utterances that fit into excel spreadsheet cells it is in this format that we can further analyze human speech into words per utterance clauses per 41 what is an utterance an utterance can be a word a phrase or an entire sentence the following are all potential examples of utterances ok uhhuh not on the floor the pink one yeah well i thought she was going to but she never did bugs lives outside honey we dont bring them in the house 42 transcribe for pauses of 2 seconds or less if the speaker hesitates to find a word treat it as one utterance unless the speaker pauses for more than two seconds if there is less than a twosecond pause put two dashes in for the hesitation and a space on either side of the dashes any time there is a pause of more than two seconds transcribe it as two separate utterances see also section 451 p_utts put it in the toy box 43 selfcorrected speech is one utterance if the speaker interrupts herself to correct herself treat it as one utterance putting two dashes between the original and the corrected words and a space on either side of the dashes p_utts dont do that nathan jake 44 selfinterrupted speech requires multiple utterances if the speaker interrupts herself to express an entirely different thought treat it as two separate utterances and put a space and two dashes after the first utterance p_utts why dont you put it dont do that 45 false starts are one utterance if the speaker has a false start in her speech treat it as one utterance and put two dashes surrounded by spaces between the repeated utterances false starts are instances when a speaker begins to say something hesitates and then resumes saying the same thing p_utts will you will you go to your room 451 a pause of more than 2 seconds requires a new utterance in the case of false starts if there is a two second or greater pause between the repeated phrases then do start a new utterance p_utts context will you 3second pause will you go to your room 452 unfinished utterances end with if the speaker has a false start and then trails off without completing her sentence or phrase just end the utterance with two dashes 453 speaker stumbling over words is one utterance if the speaker stumbles over his or her words while trying to formulate an utterance still count this as a false start and transcribe the attempts on a single utterance line to count as a false start the words must be spoken very quickly or be otherwise clearly an attempt at verbalizing a single thought for example p_utts c_utts no dont oh no where what where did you put it 46 utterances never span more than one conversational turn an utterance is never more than one conversational turn when people are taking turns talking having a conversation a single utterance will never span over more than one persons turn recall that in section 32 when a person is interrupted and doesnt acknowledge the interruption this is still a single conversational turn 47 utterances are never more than one complete sentence an utterance is never more than one complete sentence long a sentence is a segment of speech containing a subject and a predicate complete sentences include things like the man is walking and im sleepy if sentences are joined by conjunction words like and or but because after for so if when etc then its okay to transcribe them together on a single utterance line but if there are no conjunction words the sentences should be separate utterances for example the following could be utterances but you said you would the one thats right over there ill go first and then you can have a turn if i tag you you have to go to jail i wanted to throw it but then i remembered not to because then i would get in trouble he keeps hiding and the following should never be transcribed as single utterances get your coat its time to go you know what lets do this inside bring it to me later im busy right now 471 conditional constructions in aave especially in africanamerican vernacular english aave it is common to create ifthen constructions while omitting the words if and then you might for example hear somebody say you leave your jacket off youre going to get cold meaning if you leave your jacket off then youre going to get cold transcribe constructions such as these on a single utterance line even if the connecting words technically are not present 48 use semantic and syntactic cohesion to determine utterance boundary in general when phrases are related semantically and grammatically they should be transcribed together as one utterance if there is less than a two second pause between them for instance the phrases ill go first and and then you can have a turn are related semantically because after ill go first is the time when you can have a turn and the conjunction words and then connect the phrases to each other grammatically another example are the phrases are you having fun and on the couch these are related semantically because on the couch is a place where you could in most cases utterances like the ones above should be transcribed as follows p_utts c_utts ill go first and then you can have a turn are you having fun on the couch but occasionally people will add something as sort of an afterthought that could have been related semantically and grammatically to the rest of the utterance but isnt part of the original train of thought in cases where speaker adds a phrase more as an afterthought than as part of the original utterance transcribe the phrases as separate utterances like this p_utts c_utts ill go first and then you can have a turn are you having fun on the couch but how can we determine whether two phrases are part of the same train of thought or not use the guidelines in 481 and 482 to determine whether you have strong enough evidence to break up two phrases that could be semantically and grammatically related 481 a pause of more than 2 seconds trumps semanticsyntactic cohesion if there is a twosecond or longer pause in between phrases transcribe them as two separate utterances instead of a single utterance even if they are semantically and syntactically cohesive p_utts c_utts context are you having fun at least 2 full seconds of pause after fun on the couch ill go first at least 2 full seconds of pause after first and then you can have a turn 482 use intonational contours to help determine utterance boundary if two phrases are part of two totally separate intonational contours transcribe them as two separate utterances instead of a single utterance intonational contour refers to the pattern the pitch of your voice makes when you utter questions propositions and commands linguists have formed nuanced and complex theories about the intonational contour patterns of different languages but for the purposes of transcribing you only need to know the following principles which we will illustrate using the example of a question when you form a question in english you usually raise the pitch of your voice at the end like this the rising line represents the way your voice goes up at the end of the question an utterance with this intonational contour pattern would be transcribed on one line if you form two distinct questions however your voice will do something like this your voices pitch rises twice because youve asked two questions with two intonational contours this example would be transcribed as two utterances on two separate lines sometimes you will encounter a complex intonational contour pattern where there are two segments of a larger intonational pattern such a contour would look something like this the above example still has a single intonational contour even though that contour is complex and should be transcribed as a single utterance on a single line 49 tag words and phrases people often use tag words and phrases in their speech a tag is a word or short phrase that frames or clarifies the rest of the sentence or phrase and usually occurs at the beginning or end of an utterance 491 tags to transcribe on the same line when you encounter tags like the ones in the table below err on the side of them on the same utterance line as the speech they accompany instead of on their own separate line the tags below not an exhaustive list either do not have a verb or are sentence fragments without a subject because they are not full sentences there is no prohibition against putting them on the same utterance line as another sentence however just as is the case with phrases that are connected structurally there are times when you should transcribe tag words and phrases such as 481 and 482 regarding pauses and intonational contours to decide when to transcribe a nonsentence tag word or phrase as its own separate utterance examples of tag words and phrases tag wordphrase appearing at the beginning appearing at the end ok ok can we go now i get it ok honey honey will you put your toys away its in the kitchen honey right right first the top then the bottom put it in the oven right well well not without your brother na here here let me do this na no no not the blue one na oh boy oh boy youre in for a treat na my goodness my goodness that was a big burp na mommy mommy help me i want down mommy remember remember no running in the kitchen i put those in your toy box remember see see its not so scary its up on top see look at look at theyre picking vegetables na 492 transcribe inverted auxiliary tag questions at the end of a sentence an inverted question can also be a tag these tags are formed by taking the auxiliary verb or do if there isnt an explicit auxiliary verb and forming a negated question from it err on the side of transcribing inverted tag questions on the same utterance line as the speech they accompany tag question appearing at the beginning appearing at the end isnt it na thats the right answer isnt it do we na we dont need to watch tv right now do we arent you na youre a little cranky today arent you didnt you na you saw your friend at the store today didnt you 493 tags to transcribe on a separate line sometimes you will hear complete sentences spoken like tags do not transcribe complete sentence tags on the same utterance line as another sentence even if they really really sound like they go together this would be a violation of rule 47 if a speaker says transcribe it as i know its so crazy i know its so crazy i dont know maybe we should wait until after dinner i dont know maybe we should wait until after dinner you know what lets put the toys away first you know what lets put the toys away first there you go its all fixed there you go its all fixed you see all three things are the same color you see all three things are the same color 494 tags vs multiclause utterances you may notice that a subset of these tags such as i know and you see could actually be the beginning of a sentence without being a tag for example a speaker might say i know its so crazy meaning i know that its so crazy most sentences that fall into this category contain verbs of perception or cognition like think see know wish etc in cases where a speaker means something like i know that its so crazy or you see that all three things are the same color but has simply omitted the word that put them on 410 repeated words and phrases may be transcribed as one utterance if a speaker keeps repeating a word or short phrase over and over again eg no no no no no no no nono or i wont i wont i wont i wont or is counting saying the alphabet or reciting a list use rules 481 and 482 to establish utterance boundaries if you are dealing with a short repeated sentence like i wont then you have leave to break rule 47 and put them on the same utterance line if they are spoken rapidly they are part of a single intonational contour as defined in 482 there is no discernible pause in between repetitions basically a b and c are to help you determine in an objective way whether to make it look in the transcript like the speaker kept uttering the same thing over and over again or like they said one utterance with an emphatically repeated sentence in it whenever you have a repeated word or phrase type it out according to the conventions in rule 63",

    "text": "why music math this course will touch on areas of music math which adds a different perspective to the traditional conversation about music theory i think it is very helpful from time to time to look at musical principles from a mathematical perspective and it helps to link music theory to other areas of the earlham curriculum musical ratio and musical proportion ratio as relationship what is a ratio in mathematics accordingto the excellent website mathpage a ratio is the spoken language of arithmetic it is the language with which we relate quantities of the same kind a ratio is therefore a relationship between two quantities if you have 10 and i only have 5 the fact that you have two times more dollars than me is the ratio 21 if a kind friend gives each of us 5 you are still richer than me but the relationship ie the ratio of our money has changed you now have 15 i have 10 thus you now have three dollars for every two of my dollars which is the ratio 32 if we invest our money and we each increase our sum tenfold we are both happier people but our relationship has not changed your 150 and my 100 remains in the relationship in the ratio of 32 proportion is related to ratio and simple shows that two ratios are the same no matter how much our money increases or decreases if the ratios remain the same their proportions remain identical this matters of course for music since two notes an octave apart may have different frequencies but as long as they remain octaves they are in direct proportion to one another i know that all this is likely obvious and trivial but its worth stating this clearly before we move on to the musical application of ratio simple musical ratios a musical interval is a mathematical ratio as we saw in the legend of pythagoras and the blacksmith shop on the previous page the simplest ratios when measured on the monochord produce musical intervals that are most pleasing to the ear when pythagoras measured the hammers from the blacksmith shop he discovered them to be in exact lowinteger relationship to each other when he then created the monochord and moved the bridge along the string measuring the relationship of the two distances on both sides of the bridge he took note of the ratios between the two sides of the bridge and discovered them also to be in precise lowinteger relationships with each other this straightforward image is worth holding in your mind as you think of simple musical ratios here well derive these ratios a little bit more mathematically the simple ratios that i want you to know at this point are octave as 21 perfect fifth as 32 perfect fourth as 43 pythagorean whole tone as 98 lets see how these ratios are derived octave as 21 or in pythagorean terms 126 the octave 21 is of course the most basic ratio or relationship in music it occurs naturally when women and men or men and children sing together it is fundamentally the relationship of one thing vibrating twice as much as another thing there are a number of ways to think of this if you play a string then stop the string at half its length it will sound exactly an octave higher if you play a string then play another string that is exactly twice its length it will sound an octave lower ignoring the physics of physical tension and string construction this is how a harp is designed a string twice as long sounds an octave lower the piano in this sense is just a harp with hammers if you play a tube closed at one end and play a similar tube that is twice its length the second tube will sound an octave lower if you measure the tension on a tuned drum head and then precisely double that tension it will sound an octave higher regardless of how you think of it physically 21 is a fundamental principle of harmonic relationship if a string or tube vibrates at frequency then 2 f will sound an octave higher and f 2 will sound an octave lower this results in an exponential curve as regards frequency but in a linear curve as regards our perception of octave relationship as the frequency of a pitch doubles in value the musical relationship remains that of an octave thus for any given frequency rising octaves can be expressed by the formula f 2x where x is a whole number so for a frequency of 275 the lowest a on the piano an octave higher is 275 21 a 55 an octave above that is 275 22 two squared or 275 4 a 110 an octave above that is 275 23 two cubed or 275 8 220 and the octave above that is 275 24 or 275 16 440 which is the standard tuning note for the orchestra thus octaves rise exponentially as 275 55 110 220 <phone> and 3520 the fundamental frequency of the highest a on the piano every octave is twice the frequency of the previous octave for the pythagoreans they calculated the octave as being a ratio of 126 which is a proportion of the fundamental octave 21 this allowed for the remaining intervals to be calculated using only positive integers lets look at how that worked what we will discover is that the arithmetic mean between the octave is 32 and the harmonic mean between the octave is 43 these are the intervals of the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth respectively when adding intervals together you multiply their ratios thus 43 32 126 2 which is the octave this explains why when adding intervals together that are inversions of each other they result in the perfect octave even though arithmetically 4 5 9 perfect fifth as 32 from the arithmetic mean between the octave what i find useful and interesting is that for the earliest music theorists the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth were both considered to be the mean tone or the midpoint between the octave they were each derived however by two different mathematical calculations the importance of this is to stress the centrality of the perfect fourth and the perfect fifth in all subsequent theories of music and to demonstrate mathematically why they exist as reciprocal inversions of each other taking 126 as the fundamental expression of the octave proportion the pythagoreans defined the perfect fifth as resulting from calculating the arithmetic mean the arithmetic mean or midpoint between two numbers is the what we normally mean when we say take the average this can expressed algebraically as a b2 for example the arithmetic mean between 4 and 6 is 5 which is obvious but can be expressed in a formula as 4 6 2 5 this is how the pythagoreans derived the interval of the perfect fifth divide the string of the monochord into 12 equal parts take the octave to be 126 take the perfect fifth to be the arithmetic mean between 12 and 6 this results in the simple calculation 12 6 2 182 9 thus the ratio of the octave to the fifth is 9 6 which can reduced to 3 2 by of course dividing each side of the ratio by 3 perfect fourth as 43 from the harmonic mean between the octave the main point in discussing these musical means is that the perfect fourth was also derived from finding the mean or midpoint between the octave but instead of using the arithmetic mean it made use of the harmonic mean what is the harmonic mean well in a series the difference between the first and second terms in the series is related to the difference between the second and third as the first term is related to the third algebraically we could say ac ab bc or put another way b 2aca c since in the example above the arithmetic mean between 4 and 6 was 5 the harmonic mean would be 2 24 10 48 while a visit over to the wikipedia page on the harmonic mean shows its complexity as does the page on the pythagorean means in general for the purposes of this specific discussion we need only use this formula to find the harmonic mean between the 12 6 octave using the formula b 2aca c we get 2 12 6 12 6 144 18 8 thus the ratio of the perfect fourth is 8 6 which can be reduced down to 43 by of course dividing each side by 2 for millennia this has been diagrammed in the following way we see here the octave as 126 reduced to 21 we see the perfect fifth as either 96 or 128 which can both be reduced to 32 we see the perfect fourth as either 86 or 12 9 which can both be reduced to 43 we can see too that the perfect fifth and the perfect fourth are in a reciprocal relationship with one another up a fifth is the same as down a fourth up a fourth is the same as down a fifth thus are derived the fundamental intervals of the perfect fourth and perfect fifth as the arithmetic and harmonic means respectively between the octave as an aside and about which well have more to say later the third pythagorean mean the geometric mean results in the diminished fifth which is the irrational number 2 the devil in music indeed pythagorean whole tone as 98 or the space bewteen the two means finally we can discover the final essential pythagorean interval which is the pythagorean whole tone from the diagram above we can see the space between the overlapping fourths and fifths it is expressed here as the ratio of 98 this is the fundamental pythagrean whole tone this pythagorean whole tone can also be derived mathematically as the difference between the results of the arithmetic and harmonic means to find the difference between ratios they must be divided 32 divided by 43 is the same as 32 multiplied by 34 to divide fractions take the recipropcal of one fraction and multiply 32 34 98 the pythagorean whole tone it is also worth discovering this same pythagorean whole tone if we add two fifths together and then divide by an octave heres the the math on that two perfect fifths added together is calculated by multiplying their ratios 32 32 94 if we use our modern language and think in the key of c major then this would be c up to g and then g up to the d the octave and a fifth above the c to bring that 94 ratio down an octave we must divide by 2 or multiply by 12 94 12 98 our pythagorean whole tone c up to d in a major scale the pythagorean circle of fifths since the fifth was considered the perfect ratio as was its reciprocal the perfect fourth by means of its being derived by the simplest of mathematical ratios the pythagoreans concluded that musical scales could and indeed should be constructed solely through using perfect fifths and reducing them down by octaves if we start on a low c and go up by fifths we would end up with the five notes of our basic c major pentatonic scale this stack of perfect fifths all derived from 32 ratios c g d a e could be brought into a single octave resulting in the pitches c d e g and a theoretically this stacking of perfect fifths could be carried on until one reached b on the piano and on other equal tempered instruments b c but in actuality the math doesnt quite work out this results in the pythagorean comma the

    "text": "notice this information has been archived and may contain outdated content thursday november 7 2002 swine general question i would like some information on castration of older pigs answer it will be a real chore to castrate a mature boar 6 months or older he must be restrained in a fashion that will not allow him to move around especially to the point where he will not be able to injure someone then you will need a very sharp knife and disinfectant he should then be kept in an area that is reasonably clean free of mud manure etc and probably with some bedding how long after castration prior to slaughter at least until the wound incisions heals my professional opinion is that you should use a veterinarian to castration the surgical removal of the two testicles is a routine management practice for male pigs destined for slaughter the testicles produce sperm and the male hormone testosterone pork from boars or uncastrated male pigs at slaughter weight may have an odor during cooking that is very offensive to many people this is called a boar odor or a tainted odor various techniques are used for castration the position of the animal during surgery and the method and degree of restraint are dictated by the age and size of the animal the best time to castrate a pig is between 1 and 21 days of age young pigs are easier to hold or restrain they bleed less from surgery and may have antibody protection from the sows colostrum pigs can be successfully castrated on day one one of the major disadvantages of castrating early is that scrotal hernias are more difficult to detect most scrotal hernias are genetic in origin do for pigs several weeks old one person holds the pig by the rear legs while the other person does the castrating for younger pigs it is possible for one person to hold the pig with one hand or between the knees and also do the castration a mechanical pig holder can be used once the pig is restrained clean the scrotum and surrounding area with a cotton swab soaked in a mild disinfectant a disinfected sharp castration knife scalpel or razorblade type instrument can be used to make the incision examine the testicles before making the incision to determine if there are two of similar size if there is a scrotal enlargement it could indicate a scrotal hernia or rupture do not castrate the pig unless you are trained to repair hernias the pigs intestines will be forced through the incision sometimes the testicle is removed before a scrotal hernia is discovered if if one or both testicles are not found the pig may be a cryptorchid meaning that the testicles failed to descend through the inguinal canal from the abdomen during development when this condition is noticed ear notch the pig and make a record of it often the testicles will descend to a normal position as the pig grows the pig should be castrated later after the testicle presents itself with one hand tighten the skin over the scrotum to help expose the testicle and the site for the incision with the castration instrument make two incisions about as long as the testicles near the center of each cut deeply enough to go through the outside body skin cutting or not cutting the white membrane tunica vaginalis which surrounds the testicle is an individual preference and is optional on small pigs squeeze or pop the testicles through the incision if it is difficult to get the testicle through the incision enlarge the incision slightly at the end closest to the later observe castrated animals for excess bleeding or the presence of tissue or intestines hernia cut off any cord that may be protruding from the incision as this may serve as a wick for infection but make sure it is not intestine if intestines protrude gently push them back through the opening and close up by suturing the tunica vaginalis it is much easier to replace the intestines if the tunica vaginalis covering the testicle is not removed during castration gilbert hollis extension swine specialist university of illinois",

    "text": "end game equipment check out this great guide by zachans on reddit on the best in slot gear at the moment right here first things first lets talk about gear score gs gear score is a stat that is provided through equipment which is based off of the gear rarity level enchantment level and generally put the difficulty of the dungeon it was obtained from the dungeons at level 50 have a minimum gs requirement listed in the dungeon sections that are required for you to even enter the dungeon which is why upgrading your equipment especially your weapon and topbottomsuit will be required for you to have enough gs to do certain dungeons do note however that offhand weapons except an offhand however do not mistake a higher gs to mean that the equipment is better than something else you can have a piece of equipment that has lower gs but better rolls on basic and bonus attributes therefore you should always be looking at the basic and bonus attributes when comparing two pieces of equipment however if you are trying to get enough gs to do the level 50 dungeons you dont really have to care about the attributes as long as you get something that gives you higher gs than what you already have since your number one priority at maple weeb s video your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video screenshot of this weapon was provided by honyoponyoko from the official maplestory 2 discord to the left of the equipment name is 11 which is represents the enchantment level of that equipment underneath is the weapon attack if weapon or defense for everything else equipment have a base value for their weapon attackdefense but these values are adjusted based on the the roll that you get for the basic attribute as indicated by the items base weapon attack increased by 287 in this example the gear score can also be seen in this example with 762 being a result of the successful enchanting that has been done on the equipment the basic attribute types will always be the same for that equipment name in this example all shiny platinum leafbladed swords will have items base weapon attack increase health and physical attack for the basic attributes but these numbers will be different within a minimum and maximum value the bonus attributes are the more important stats that you really want to keep your eye on some pieces of equipment can only give certain types of bonus attributes pyrros gloves give int and fire damage balrog earrings give boss damage and attack speed but most equipment will have random bonus attributes with a random number within a minimum and maximum value if a bonus attribute has the max roll possible it should indicate so with max being shown after the value anything that is not max but is in a purple color indicates that it is a high roll and is still pretty good as for what bonus attributes you should aim for i am still confused as to what the priority should be but the undisputed top two stats you should aim for are accuracy and piercing accuracy you should aim for at least around 90 accuracy realistically ideally you would want to get 110 accuracy accuracy can be obtained through accessories but i believe they can also be obtained through weapons need confirmation the harder the dungeonraid you are trying to clear the more accuracy you will usually need classes that put their points into dex dexterity may find that they can pass with 5 less accuracy 85 realistically 105 ideally since dex gives you accuracy as well piercing piercing is different from physical and magic piercing since it is affecting the damage calculation based on the enemys defense not their physical and magic defense which are usually at much lower numbers than defense you can get piercing from accessories and weapons realistically you want to get around 1516 piercing from equipment more is always better though and boost it up to 1920 with the piercing souvenir buff from housing should be called scion of light ideally you would want to get 30 piercing i dont know if its possible with our version just yet these two stats are the most important and should be prioritized the most as for everything else i have asked on the discord and there seems to be mixed opinions but the general idea seems to be something like this subject to change accuracy piercing caps at 30 but probably impossible to cap at the moment on release magicphysical piercing caps at 15 but i think you dont need more than 10 total damageboss damagemelee damageranged damage from my understanding total damageboss damagemelee damageranged damage all do the same thing however total damage applies to all damage while the other three are more specific as a result total damage generally has a smaller max number on equipment while the other 3 have higher numbers as a result you may find it beneficial to prioritize boss damage over total damage combined with melee damageranged damage based on your class attack speed is also a great stat from my understanding as it reduces the cast time for your skills but i am unsure of where to place it in the priority list it does seem to be great on heavy gunners especially because of their reliance on cast times crit damage is capped at 250 from korean sources it is apparently a very important stat for assassins but it may be too early to get crit damage given our current equipment available to us same for crit rate as for the stats that you want to get on each equipment generally with the exception of named equipment like balrog earrings that can give boss damage subject to change gemstones attackstatint dex etc rings piercingaccuracy necklace piercingaccuracy cape piercingaccuracy belt piercingaccuracy hat boss damage top boss damage bottom boss damage suit boss damage gloves physical piercingmagical piercing shoes boss damagemovement speed weapons piercingphysical

played in shopping malls churches and holiday parties you know all their words by heart but do you know how some of the worlds bestknown christmas carols were created 1 silent night the legend behind one of the most popular christmas carols in the world plays out as a sort of christmas miracle the story goes that father joseph mohr of oberndorf austria was determined to have music at his christmas eve service even though the organ at his beloved st nicholas church was broken so he penned a poem and asked his friend franz gruber to compose a score for it that would not demand an organ the truth however is a little less dramatic in 1816 the catholic priest wrote the poem stille nacht heilige nacht while stationed at a pilgrim church in mariapfarr austria when he transferred to st nicholass two years later he did ask gruber to help him write guitar music for the poem which the two performedbacked by a choiron christmas eve of 1818 silent night was translated into english more than 40 years later by episcopal priest john freeman young who is responsible for the version americans favor the song has been translated into 142 languages to date 2 santa claus is coming to town your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video penned by james haven gillespie this jolly tune was first performed on american singer eddie cantors radio show in 1934 but for all its mirth its inspiration came from a place of grief in his book stories behind the greatest hits of christmas ace collins explains how gillespie was a vaudevillianturnedsongwriter whod fallen on hard times both financially and personally gillespie got the call to pen a christmas tune for cantor just after learning his brother had died initially he rejected the job feeling too overcome with grief to consider penning a playful holiday ditty but a subway ride recollecting his childhood with his brother and his mothers warnings that santa was watching changed his mind he had the lyrics in 15 minutes then called in composer john coots to make up the music that would become a big hit within 24 hours of its debut 3 hark the herald angels sing your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video the earliest incarnation of this carol was a poem penned in 1739 by charles wesley brother of john wesley the founder of methodism however the original opening line as it appeared in his collection hymns and sacred poems was hark how all the welkin rings using a rarely invoked term for heaven anglican preacher and wesley contemporary george whitefield tweaked the opening line to the titular one we know today in these early versions hark the herald angels sing was sung to several different tunes including new britain the jauntier tempo its sung to today came from german composer felix mendelssohn more than 100 years after it was written english musician william h cummings paired the carol to mendelssohns cantata fetgesang while this is the variant that has caught on it is a development unlikely to be appreciated by wesley or mendelssohn the former believed the hymn was best sung slowly while the latter was a strictly secular musician 4 deck the halls this jaunty tune dates back to sixteenth century wales where its melody and much of the lyrics were pinched from the new years eve song nos galan lines like oh how soft my fair ones bosom fa la la la la la la la la were transformed into yuletide wishes like deck the halls with boughs of holly fa la la la la la la la la this musical makeover was done by scottish folk music scribe thomas oliphant who built his reputation on old melodies with new lyrics in 1862 his deck the hall was published in welsh melodies vol 2 hed go on to become a renowned translator of songs as well as a lyricist for the court of queen victoria but oliphants version is not the one most commonly sung today now called deck the halls lines like fill the meadcup drain the barrel have been swapped for don we now our gay apparel this variant became popular from revised music sheet printings made in 1877 and 1881 5 good king wenceslas this unconventional but beloved carol dates back to 1853 when english hymnwriter john mason neale first penned its lyrics set to the tune of the 14thcentury carol the time is near for flowering good king wenceslas focuses on the journey of a kind man who set out in terrible weather on the postchristmas holiday of saint stephens day to provide aid to poor neighbors this titular king was a real man wenceslaus i duke of bohemia who ruled from 924 to 935 when he was assassinated by his own brother boleslav the cruel unlike his nefariously nicknamed sibling wenceslaus was adored by his subjects his great acts of charity led to him posthumously being declared a king and an eventual upgrade to sainthood he is now the patron saint to the czech republic 6 all i want for christmas is my two front teeth your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video this saccharine song is sung from the perspective of a child with a simple wish and a fleet of such children was in fact its inspiration in 1944 grade school teacher donald yetter gardner and his wife doris sat down with a group of secondgraders in smithtown new york to help them compose a song for christmas while there are different versions of the origin they all involve a bunch of children saying all i want for christmas is its not so much that any students wished for those absent front teeth but more that gardner was charmed by their requests hindered by toothless lisping as gardner told it he went home that night and in just 30 minutes penned the christmas tune that would earn him royalties until his death in the fall of 2004 a performance at his school of the song led to a meeting with witmark music company and ultimately to spike jones and his city slickers recording the ditty in 1948 gardner gave up his teaching job to become a music consultant and editor and later remarked in awe of his own success i was amazed at the way that silly little song was picked up by the whole country 7 jingle bells though one of the most popular nonreligious yuletide tunes jingle bells was not originally conceived for christmas time at all penned by james lord pierpont in 1850s savannah georgia the song originally titled the one horse open sleigh was intended to celebrate thanksgiving the local unitarian church where hed later play the song on the organ boasts historical markers declaring it the birthplace of jingle bells however some sources insist pierpont was belting the memorable melody as early as 1850 when he still lived in medford massachusetts debate still rages about the true birthplace of the song jingle bells was renamed in 1857 when its lyrics and notes were first published decades passed before it rose to prominence yet it made history on december 16 1965 becoming the first song broadcast in space the crew of gemini 6 followed reports of seeing santa claus with an improvised version of jingle bells which included bells and a harmonica that they had snuck onboard mission control responded to the surprise serenade with youre too much 6 8 o tannenbaum commonly translated as o christmas tree this carol comes from germany the earliest version of the song dates back to the 16th century when melchior franck wrote a folk song about the tradition of bringing a small fir tree into ones home to decorate and sit beside the seasonal nativity scene this decorating tradition and its celebratory song moved from germany to the us along with its emigrants revisions to the lyrics were made in 1819 by joachim august zarnack and in 1824 by leipzig organist ernst anschutz as christmas tree trimming caught on in the 1800s o tannenbaum grew in popularity in the past century the song has been included on countless christmas albums as well as in such family entertainment as disneys swiss family robinson ernest saves christmas and a charlie brown christmas 9 o little town of bethlehem this religious carol tells the tale of the birth of jesus and was inspired by a pilgrims moving christmas eve experience in the holy lands phillip brooks was a distinguished man of faith and intellect a bostonborn episcopalian preacher hed earned a doctorate of divinity from the university of oxford taught at yale university and publically advocated against slavery during the civil war but hes best known for penning o little town of bethlehem after a lifechanging journey in 1865 brooks rode on horseback from jerusalem to bethlehem where he participated in the church of the nativitys fivehour long christmas eve celebration complete with hymns returning home this experience proved so profound that he channeled it into the song sung in churches to this day its first public performance was held three years later performed by the childrens choir of his church on december 27 10 have yourself a merry little christmas your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available click here to visit our frequently asked questions about html5 video a carol that is at once hopeful and mournful have yourself a merry little christmass lyrics were penned by hugh martin for a scene in the 1944 movie musical meet me in st louis judy garland sings the bittersweet song to her little sister trying to cheer her up as both lament their familys move away from their hometown but garland and director vincente minnelli werent happy with martins early much more maudlin drafts these included lines that martin would later describe as hysterically lugubrious like have yourself a merry little christmasit may be your last faithful friends who were dear to uswill be near to us no more martin initially refused to revise the lyrics but a blue talking to from actor tom drake set him straight he said you stupid son of a bitch martin recollected youre gonna foul up your life if you dont write another verse of that song ultimately martin gave the song a more hopeful leaning first for the movie then again in 1957 at the request of frank sinatra for ol blue eyes he changed well have to muddle through somehow to the more jolly hang a shining star upon the highest bough the song has since became a standard in both holidays 0 twitter subscribe to our newsletter",

girl at 11 years old she was selling herself for clean drinking water when all she really wanted was to go to school more than me was founded to meet her needs we opened a school the mtm academy for 150 girls and saw major progress then ebola hit the world didnt act quickly enough and we knew we had to fight to save her life after spending six months on the front lines fighting ebola and seeing three students lose their families and many other children lose their own lives we realized that our liberias education system is a mess 65 of primary school age children are out of school and only 20 of students enrolled in grade 1 enroll in grade 12 with just 4 million people and 15 million children liberia has tremendous potential the ministry of education has asked us to partner with them to replicate our model in liberian schools and add capacity to the ministry to meet their priorities we are committed to maintaining a center of excellence at our academy while also scaling our successes into pilot government schools across the country we are committed to supporting these projects until this generation of students graduates and becomes liberias future leaders learn more about our programs here why liberia liberia west africa has a population of about 4 million people the official language is english the name liberia derives from liberty meaning freedom a 14year brutal civil war destroyed over 80 of the countrys schools the recent ebola epidemic further weakened liberias infrastructure liberias education system is in a state of emergency each one of the 25000 applicants to the university of liberia in 2013 failed the entrance exam 65 of primary school age children are out of school more than half 51 of young people aged 1524 are illiterate and approximately 73 of all women and girls in liberia are illiterate only 17 of teachers have a tertiary degreelevel qualification only 20 of students enrolled in grade 1 enroll in grade 12 if liberia is going to build a more stable and resilient future we can not stand still investing in girls is the best thing you can do why girls according to girlup more than 40 of liberian girls ages 1014 have never gone to school unfortunately young girls fall victim to the most frequently reported crime in liberia rape but investing in girls has huge rewards when a girl in the developing world receives 7 or more years of education she marries 4 years later and has 22 fewer children an extra year of primary school boosts girls eventual wages by 1020 an extra year of secondary school 1525 when women and girls earn income they reinvest 90 of it into their families as compared to only 3040 for a man for girls to get to a place where they feel secure there needs to be education for all gbv will only end if we take a strong stance against it our stance on gender based violencegbv 65 of the 1002 cases reported in 2013 concerned victims aged between 3 and 14 yet just 137 cases came to court and only 49 rapists were convicted liberias rape laws which only came into effect in 2006 classify rape as intentional penetration of a penis another body part or an object into the vagina or anus of another person without that persons consent or sexual intercourse between a person who is over 18 years of age and a person who is not yet 18 years of age even if the younger person agreed to the act or was not forced into it the punishment is life imprisonment though it is rarely enforced liberia established criminal court e in 2008 a special court where sexual and genderbased violence cases are tried despite these efforts the court has only completed 18 trials in the past four years with just a handful of convictions in 2012 only five trials were completed and 93 percent of the cases were dismissed our worst nightmare on june 12 2014 our school nurse told senior management that a student had confided to her that an important member of our team macintosh johnson a program coordinator and community liaison had sexually assaulted her once our senior team learned this horrific news liberian police were contacted and the suspect was arrested 4 days later his trial began in september 2015 with a case brought by the government of liberia the courage of the first student to come forward gave 9 other girls the confidence to come forward too after a mistrial in 2016 the defendant died in prison actions taken to ensure safety this incident increased our vigilance over personal safety we want our stance to be heard loud and clear that we have a zero tolerance policy for abuse weve since taken the following actions to ensure the safety of our students we reevaluated our ratio of male and female staff and have made every effort possible to hire qualified female teachers as they interact with our students the most we continue to monitor all of our staff regardless of gender to ensure there is no abuse of any kind under no circumstance are girls left alone on campus or in vehicles with males we have a schedule that is followed and we know where every single child is at any time during the day the schedule allows no time for students to be alone with anyone in the building except with the nurse or social worker we revised our child protection policy and code of conduct which all staff signed we conduct reference checks for every staff member we created and implemented a whistleblower protection policy we created systems for anonymous complaints and formally documented complaints to further build a culture of trust among students and staff we implemented sexual and reproductive health classes that include age appropriate awareness education on assault and abuse so students can recognize inappropriate behavior we conduct parent trainings on gender based violence to spread awareness to families and the community the safety of the children we serve is our number one priority more than me has a zero tolerance policy for sexual violence and exploitation standing with our students we are extremely proud of our students for speaking out when rape and transactional sex are all too commonly accepted and victims are expected to stay silent our students proved that they can stand up and advocate for themselves and thats huge creating a culture of trust and safe space for children to share what is happening with them is a vital first step to systemic change and a step we hope more schools and communities will strive for we refuse to stay silent as we work to rebuild liberias education system alongside the ministry of education we are committed to making child protection one of the key pillars of these reforms additional resources mtm is committed to transparency and acting as a resource for other organizations and communities were compiling a list of our own resources and outside resources that have helped shape our actions along the way if youd like to talk to someone from our team about an issue at your school or in your

fusing the tibia to the talus bone so that your foot is under your body and flat to the floor this procedure can be performed as keyhole surgery also referred to as arthroscopic surgery or open surgery in keyhole surgery a number of small incisions are made whereas in open surgery a larger incision is made the damaged joint surfaces are removed and the bones are held together using screws to maintain the position while bone healing occurs and the bones fuse together to become one this converts a stiff painful joint into a stiff but painfree one the surgery takes between one and two hours and you will have a tourniquet applied around your thigh during the surgery to reduce bleeding when you wake from surgery you will have a below knee partial cast which may later be changed into a full below knee plaster or synthetic cast you will have to wear a cast for up to 12 weeks you will need crutches or a frame to help you move around during this time depending on your situation your surgeon will allow you to weight bear after about 6 weeks and sometimes sooner you should discuss your postoperative care with your surgeon because you are immobilised after surgery it is usually recommended that you have bloodthinning medication to prevent blood clots whilst in the cast as well as a special stocking on the other leg to improve blood flow after the plaster cast is removed you may require an ankle brace or a walking boot for a few more weeks you will then be able to wear your normal shoes sometimes changes are made to the sole of the shoe to give you a normal stride length despite the stiffened joint in some circumstances where there is major deformity or where the arthritis affects more than one joint your surgeon may recommend fusion of more than one joint there are lots of surgical options including a tibiotalocalcaneal fusion or a pantalar fusion these may involve a rod or a large metal nail inserted up to the middle of the shinbone through the heel to find out more

patient satisfaction in the short to medium term some patients express concerns regarding the level of mobility they will have following surgery ankle arthrodesis removes ankle movement completely however as much as 50 of the up and down movement of the foot is maintained see page 7 walking in most cases walking will return towards normal so that others may not notice that you have had an ankle arthrodesis if you walked with a limp prior to surgery because of pain after the surgery your walking is likely to improve because the stride length is shorter a limp may be noticeable if you start to run some female patients comment that it is uncomfortable or not possible to wear a highheeled shoes after ankle arthrodesis sports most patients with a successful ankle arthrodesis are able to walk without a limp cycle and do certain sports such as golf although more vigorous activities such as squash tennis or football may be possible after an ankle arthrodesis we do not recommend them as they put a lot of stress across the adjacent joints which will wear with time and pain may return similarly walking or hiking on rough ground is possible but will put more stress on the adjacent joints you

questions about html5 video this video shows a 42 year old man 1 year post arthroscopic ankle fusion he is able to stand on his tiptoes and jog albeit with a slight limp are there any major risks with ankle fusion in addition to the general risks of ankle surgery the specific risks of ankle arthrodesis relate to problems with union and transference of stress to the adjacent joints malunion research has shown that 5 to 10 of fusions do not heal in the exact position intended this may either be due to the fact that the position was not achieved at the time of surgery or that the bones have shifted while in plaster this does not usually cause any major problems but rarely further surgery may be required to correct this adjacent joint arthritis because the ankle joint has been stiffened more pressure will be taken by adjacent joints which with time are at risk of wearing signs of arthritis in the adjacent joints are common on xrays after 10 years but many patients do not require treatment for this need for further surgery sometimes the screws become prominent under the skin if this happens they can be removed but only about 1 in 10 patients need the screws to be taken out if screws need removing we usually advise you to wait at least a year after surgery to give the bones time to become strong general complications following ankle surgery swelling you should expect some swelling for up to one year after surgery elevation of limb above heart level for the first two weeks helps to reduce swelling and aid wound healing if swelling persists and you are concerned seek medical advice bleeding all wounds bleed after surgery but rarely this can be excessive causing wound problems or requiring further surgery painful scar any type of surgery will leave a scar some people develop larger scars than others occasionally this can cause pain and irritation if you suspect you are prone to scar problems please discuss this with your surgeon prior to surgery infection superficial wound infection redness around the wound occurs in up to 5 of cases much rarer less than 1 is a deep infection where the metalwork or bone is infected minor infections usually clear up with a course of antibiotics more serious infections may require further surgery and involve complex and lengthy treatment nerve injury numbness or tingling at the surgical site is common and is usually temporary but up to 50 of patients who have an ankle replacement or open ankle fusion will get some numbness on the top of their foot this is not usually a problem if a key nerve is injured up to 15 of cases then it can cause permanent numbness and shooting pains requiring medication or further specialist input rarely the sympathetic nerves also known as fight or flight nerves react badly after the surgery and cause temperature and colour changes to the skin this is known as complex problems with union occasionally in arthrodesis bones fail to unite fuse and in the case of a replacement the bones may not knit to the implant this can happen in up to 10 of patients if you smoke your risk of such a complication is greatly increased you will be advised to stop smoking before surgery blood clots deep vein thrombosis dvt is uncommon 5 and pulmonary embolus pe is very rare less than 05 and occurs due to blood clots we do everything to minimise these risks but they can occur and can be serious causing prolonged leg swelling or chest problems bloodthinning medication may be given to prevent blood clots whilst in a cast as well as a special stocking on the other leg to improve venous circulation audit research to find out more please download a copy of a reputable patient information booklet on ankle arthritis from the royal national orthopaedic hospital nhs trust there is a randomised controlled trial comparing ankle replacement against ankle fusion tarva see httpclinicaltrialsgovct2shownct01518361 if you would like to find out more about this study please contact claire thompson by email on tarvauclacuk click here to find out about ankle replacement recommendation ankle fusion continues to represent the gold standard surgical treatment of end stage ankle osteoarthritis but does carry the risk of adjacent joint arthritis patients should be counselled regarding the benefits and risks of both ankle fusion and replacement as well as the potential for non operative treatments sorry the browser you are using is not currently supported disqus actively supports the following browsers firefox chrome internet explorer 11 safari ee 4 years ago this mans walk looks very good i have heard that gait can be badly affected by fusion but this does not look the case here is this the typical outcome my ankle admin 4 years ago the amount of motion retained after ankle fusion depends on the motion in the adjacent joints prior to the surgery if you have mobile adjacent joints then you will usually retain about 50 of the up and down motion after surgery cj shene 11 months ago hello i myself have had a total of seven surgerys on my ankles w both winding up being fused i do walk with a gate cane for stability my second fusion had been painful more so then the first i believe to the fact the first fusion did not take had to be redone more nerve damage was done on top of this a bone simulator had to be surgically inserted as the fuse was not taking growing back 11 yrs now on my second triple surgery on pain meds muscle relaxersissues have come about to where i will be seeing some one as walking any daily physical exercise cause quite often severe pain weight is also a contributing factor as your ankles as they are the foundation of your whole body weight after returning back to work being a physical laborer it took a toll on my ankle other leg to where down the road i had an accident which caused 2nd fusion lg63 1 year ago ive had an ankle fusion 10 days ago and accidentally stood on my foot this morningdoes anyone know how important this isim very worried that i may have damaged it nicolette phillips 1 year ago hello i just had a ankle fusion 7 weeks agodue from an ingury 22 years ago i had to have a plate and screws on my right side of my right ankle n 2 screws on the left side of my ankleover the years i got arthritis which caused a lot of complications most of you know it deteriorates the bones or cartilage i dont know whatever when my doc first told me i needed this i was devastated i said absoutely not im 43 years old and i dont want to lose all mobilty in my ankle i came msmonkey 1 year ago hi ive had approx 30 ortho surgeries for various lower leg issues dislocations of kneecaps dislocations of a few joints in my feet and ankles im 46 last surgery was a fusion of my ankle in 2015 so far its been great id had heel realignment surgery and a subtalar fusion previously so this was just the ankle pain has gone completely and that alone was worth the 3 month recovery instability of ankle gone too obviously mobility is visually normal and by that i mean nobody notices theres much difference at all in my gaitincluding several ortho doctors ive found that ive just adapted my gait pretty much without noticing i cant run but to be fair ive not had any need to i cant go on tiptoe like the chap in the video unless i bend my knees to retain balance i cant walk far but thats not entirely due to the ankle fusion if i overdo things i get shin splints which are pretty uncomfortable but soon pass these are because the mechanics of my leg have altered postsurgery so other bones and joints now take the strains that the ankle once did immediately postsurgery there was virtually no pain at all nerve blockers used during the op about two weeks postsurgery i did experience some severe nerve pain that had me heading back to the hospital but after receiving medication for this the pain eventually went and ive had no problem with that issue since shoes with rocker soles may be helpful to some but personally ive not really found too much difference either way what i have found though is that my shoe size has changed so make sure to try on before buying new shoes its a difficult decision to make having this surgery but i can recommend it if all else has failed to help good luck tania rolland 1 year ago hi there i am trying to figure out if the man in the video had a full ankle fusion or has he had a subtalar fusion i keep being hopeful when i see videos like this that i will maintain somewhat of a normal life after surgery but then realize that they have had a different kind of fusion people seem to be lumping all ankle fusions into one group i have been told that i need a full ankle fusion and i will have no up or down movement in the ankle joint itself so i am envisioning my walk different then this and not being able to do calf raises at all would really like to know what to expect with a full fusion as i am having a very hard time making the decision to have it keith murphy 1 year ago this may be a bit late considering your question is now 3 months old i had a full fusion following 10 years or severe pain due to degenerative arthritis following a motorcycle accident and multiple surgeries the pain was so bad i needed a walking stick and painkillers did nothing i walk normally now and have no pain i never thought this would be possible im 42 and this was lifechanging for me in the most positive way i cant walk long distances as it causes muscle pain in my foot but its a small insignificant price to pay wishing keith david 3 years ago hi i will be having my left ankle fused early next year and would like to know how difficult it will be to walk up and down slopes im expecting that walking down a slope because of the lack of ankle movement will be particularly difficult is this the case or will i be able to walk normally on hilly terrain rammsteinfan 1 year ago hello david have had 11 surgeries to repair a compound fracture of my left ankle one being ankle replacement which failed and had to be removed my most recent surgery was a subtalar fusion 10 months ago i am still in a boot but try and walk without it to strengthen my ankle the hardest part of walking with or without the boot is going up or down a slope i have no balance it really sucks and i hope you have better results than i have had oh forget about stairs going down is fine but when i try maggie 3 years ago my experience of ankle injuries maggie 3 years ago hi ten years ago i fell resulting in a dislocation and trimaleol surya prakash 4 years ago hi regards im surya from india i had my right hip n right leg both bone fractured and got well operated but i suffer a foot drop with no sensation which is not recovering and im planning to do an ankle fusion without sensation recovery will it be ok im worried about a normal walk will i get it if my ankle is fusedplease advice me ee 4 years ago how can the risk of nonunion be minimized assuming the patient is already a nonsmoker what are the other factors that cause nonunion my ankle admin 4 years ago risk factors for nonunion are many and include smoking even exposure to nicotine from replacement patches and ecigarettes movement for example walking on it before you are advised and surgical issues failure to prepare the joints fully and compress them ee 4 years ago assuming a non smoker complying with the surgeons advice and a surgeon experienced surgeon who performs the operation as planned what would the nonunion risk be compared to the 90 success rate mentioned in the article jim 4 years ago question im 40 and about the have a fusion done as well 2 years ago i already had a surgery to remove bone spurs and shave my tibia down with limited success in reducing the pain and discomfort pain and swelling is back and going to fuse it does this man have pain when he walks and runsjogs my goal is to be able to jog for a couple miles again and lift weights calf raises to strengthen my calves without pain im in pain 247 and havent been able to go for a jog in about 7 years jim myankle team 4 years ago if you have your ankle joint fused you will by definition put increased stress across the surrounding joints assuming the adjacent joints are healthy then they will compensate and you will be able to run and jog without problem although after a fusion are likely to have a slight limp if however your adjacent joints already have some wear and tear then you may still have symptoms from them even if your ankle has been fused it is important to stress that if you do run and jog then you will wear the adjacent joints with time and they may my ankle admin 4 years ago after fusion of the ankle joint all motion for example in calf raises will take place in the adjacent joints if you intend to jog after surgery you may find that you put significant stress on the adjacent joints which will wear and become arthritic with time and pain may return debbie bletso 1 year ago hi i had a fusion 13 weeks ago i had the plaster cast off a week ago i am using two crutches putting about half weight walking through i get swelling redness after a short while im going swimming most days walking in the water i have taken ibuprofen for the last few days to see if this helps any feedback would be good please maureen 2 years ago had my ankle fused 12 weeks ago now had boot removed but getting discomfort from ankle also swelling is this normal debbie bletso 1 year ago hi hi i had a fusion 13 weeks ago very interested in how you are getting on now",

learning and teaching support material ltsm in south african schools reflects our apartheid past government in addressing and eliminating these inequalities of the past has invested hugely in equal provisioning of textbooks and other essential ltsm resources the key objective as per goal 19 as stated in the vision 2030 document is to ensure that each learner has access to quality learning and teaching material to meet the requirements of the curriculum and improve learner performance the northern cape department of education has rolled out the curriculum and assessment policy statement caps to all schools in the province as follows foundation phase and grade 10 2012 academic year intermediate phase and grade 11 2013 academic year and senior phase and grade 12 2014 academic year the department has also introduced an online textbook tracking and monitoring system where schools are able to place their orders and also have access to view their placed orders and delivery status this system is the first in the country and has improved service that the department renders to schools the system is currently adopted and used by the limpopo department of education with a possibility of being rolled out to all the other provinces by the department of basic education dbe our success in the implementation of caps could also be aligned to the good relationship the department has build with publishers over the years but most importantly by using the south african post office sapo as a distribution agent for the delivery of textbooks to schools learning and teaching support material ltsm the department has put systems in place to raise accountability with regard to managing this valuable resource retention and retrieval of textbooks remain a challenge which ultimately results in high annual top up needs which the department can not afford the current retrieval rate of 846 needs to be improved upon managing this resource is critical since nonretrieval impacts on universal coverage which aims to ensure all learners have the required textbooks per subject the department through its training interventions capacitated all 545 public ordinary schools on managing ltsm and improving retrieval strategies in 2017 it must be stressed that retrieval is a societal issue and that parents and the community at large have a critical role to play in ensuring that all textbooks and ltsm provided to learners are returned in a good condition our annual retrieval campaign will be strengthened and will call on all role players to advocate 100 retrieval 100 retrieval of textbooks the northern cape department of education ncdoe strives to ensure that learning and teaching takes place from day one when schools reopen in january 2016 learning and teaching support material ltsm is an integral and vital part of every education system and the effective management utilisation and maintenance of this valuable resource will ensure access and support to the delivery of quality education as the 2015 school year speedily draw to a close the ncdoe wants to call on all role players and the community at large to join the 100 retrieval of textbooks campaign and would like to remind all learners to return textbooks for the benefit of other learners in the province the provision of textbooks for every learner in the schooling system is one o the priorities of the government and millions of rands are spent annually on ltsm the department has committed that every learner must have a core textbook for every subject in grade if this resource is not protected and valued money which otherwise could have been used for new innovative ltsm has to be used to replace books which are lying in homes not being utilised parents are requested to honour their parental responsibility in ensuring that their children act responsibly and ensure that all textbooks loaned to their child is returned before the end of the 2015 academic year principals of schools are required to ensure that maximum retention of textbooks is achieved that calls for effective textbook retrieval system at every school in the province schools are however reminded not to withhold learners reportsresults as a result of failure to retrieve textbooks even though a strong culture of returning textbooks is emphasized this campaign is aimed at all citizens those in and out of school this is a societal

    "text": "the concept of stochastic dominance posted november 14 2015 by nejc hladnik in quantitative finance the concept of more or less risky is captured by the notion of a mean preserving spread ive gone ahead and test it with the concept of stochastic dominance as this combination provides better understanding of them both all graphs and calculations can be downloaded below last time we dealt with the riskaverseness so it comes by no surprise that more risky assets brings less satisfaction for the same given expected payoff this concept is intuitive thus we can quickly compare assets with expectations vs variance framework if they have at least one common point same mean value or same volatility if this condition is not met we are left in the dark just imagine are you able to tell me which asset is better for my riskaverse utility function asset 1 er 64 st deviation 44 asset 2 er 444 st deviation 779 under the standard meanvariance analysis two investments cant be ranked second investment has greater mean but also greater variance yet all of us would prefer investment 2 thus statebystate dominance is not enough for expected utility theory postulates of expected utility theory lead to a definition of two weaker alternative concepts of dominance with wider applicability these are of interest because they circumscribe the situations in which rankings among risky projects are preference free or can be defined independently of the specific tradeoffs among return risk and other characteristics of probability distributions represented by an agents utility function even though the math can be quite rigorous i want to explain the concept of stochastic dominance in a hopefully understandable way definition firstorder stochastic dominance fsd let and respectively represent the cumulative probability distribution functions of two random variables cash payoffs that without loss of generality assume values in the interval we say that first order stochastically dominates fsd if and only if for all since cumulative distribution function tells us the probability that certain payoff value will be smaller or least equal to that value in order for to fsd must be everywhere below and to the right of it should intuitively be preffered even though it can be usually interpreted from the graph it is better seen from the control chart that shows what is happening to the differences between cumulative functions as long as values dont change sign we can conclude that one investment fsd the other if sign changes than we are left in the dark and have to check for secondorded stochastic dominance for conclusion definition secondorder stochastic dominance ssd let be two super cumulative probability distribution functions for random payoffs in we say that second order stochastically dominates ssd if and only if for any x since cumulative distribution function tells us the probability that certain payoff value will be smaller or least equal to that value in order for to ssd must be everywhere below and to the right of the condition states that as long the accumulated differences between cumulative distribution functions dont change sign we are able to conclude that one investment ssd the other this is best represented by the last graph note that since super cumulative function is by definiton integral of cumulative function which is in fact integral of density function the first derivative of super cumulative function will be cumulative function we are basically just accumulating or adding up differences from the control graph as we move along the x axis some increments may be positive some may be negative but as long as accumulated differences dont change sign we can say which investment ssd the other simple continuous case fsd second investment has higher expected payoff as well as variance but when graphing both cumulative functions we can alredy see that since investment 2 lies below and more to the right of investment 1 on the whole interval that it fsd the first investment intiutivelly every given payoff on the respective interval has lower probability that it will be smaller or at least this big for investment 2 hence there is more probability left for higher payoffs on the right ssd because the condition for firstorder stochastic dominance holds we can see that the differences are accumulated nicely accumulation starts with convex and then follows a concave function all riskaverse agents will prefer the secondorded stohastically dominant assset of course fsd implies ssd if for two investments 1 and 2 1 fsd 2 then it is also true that 1 ssd 2 but the converse is not always true meanpreserving case fsd i love this example both investments have the same expected payoff but different variance looking solely at the second graph we arent able to conclude which investment is preffered even though we are intuitivelly aware of the correct answer control chart confirms that the differences are first negative and later positive so the condition doesnt hold and no investment fsd the other first there is a higher probability for a lower payoffs but becase of the higher variance same happens to the higher ones on the right side of investment 2 so which investment is dominant ssd accumulated differences are first getting more and more negative as long as increments are negative as well after riching a peak at the middle they change sign so add them up and the accumulation will again go back to zero but still the condition holds accumulated differences never changed sign and became positive our intuition is confirmed investment 1 ssd investment 2 discrete case fsd stochastic dominance can be applicable also to other distributions eg in this case we have 2 discrete probability distributions is the first condition met no this is confirmed by the difference values between them they change sign ssd is the second condition met yes on the observable interval accumulation of differences never changes sign investment 2 ssd investment 1 resources all graphs and calculations are provided in excel file more information on harvards or wikipedias post since 152018 posts

    "text": "close inspection sept 26 2017 the 5 skin products i bought after falling down a reddit rabbit hole by sara spruchfeiner reddittested meapproved if skin is a battlefield then members of reddits skincare addiction sub are an army of determined warriors unwilling to rest until the battles been won on the message board products are methodically tested analyzed judged and critiqued if a user needs help pinpointing what may or may not be working others are invited to step in its a team of some 321353 amateur dermatologists acne is never just acne and dry skin is never just dry skin theyre closed comedones and dehydration ive been writing about beauty for years and while ive tried everything from 1 korean sheet masks to 600 swiss serums reddits unbiased nononsense skincare obsessives intrigued me so i dug deep into the sca archives compiled some of their mostdiscussed favorite products excepting your standard fare like cerave face wash and stridex pads and tried them myself what redditors say its the first product ive ever used that makes me feel like im in that scene in mulan where she just wipes her face and her makeup just slides right off peachbot what i thought micellar waters if you dont know em are a frenchgirl beauty secret gone mainstream used to remove makeup or for cleansing on lazy days basically cleansingoil molecules micelles suspended in water help draw dirt and oil out of the skin without stripping skin of natural oils in my opinion which is shared with most dermatologists theyre best saved for inapinch situations postworkout travel etc rather than to replace your cleansing routine this may be personal preference but cleansing the traditional way over the sink has become something i look forward to at the end of each day micellar water is great for your gym bag though and garniers is more affordable than its similarly packaged french counterpart its quick easy a little bit refreshing and didnt irritate my skin in the slightest if i can i still prefer washing my face though it just feels more thorough but on the go micellar water is a great solution ill keep one in my gym bag garnier skinactive micellar cleansing water 9 at ulta what redditors say will rebuy forever it doesnt leave your skin feeling greasy or unwashed but i definitely recommend using your normal cleanser afterwards itsadooozy what i thought anyone whos serious about skin care knows never go to bed with your makeup on one of reddits favorite ways to remove it cliniques og balm at 30 its pricier than drugstore cleansers but then cleansing balms havent even made their way to drugstores yet compared to face wash a balm doesnt lather and thus wont strip your skin i like this one a lot because its fragrancefree with a very pleasant sensory experience you massage the balm into dry skin and watch as it melts into an oil taking dirt and makeup with it its so mild itd be a great option when my notsupersensitive skin is feeling dry or otherwise acts up i do have to say though that i prefer annee de mamiels restorative cleansing balm which comes with a breathing exercise to do while cleansing that i swear feels like a nearspiritual experience of course its also more than double the price if youve never tried a cleansing balm before though the clinique is the way to start sensitive skin types may just be converted clinique take the day off cleansing balm 30 at nordstrom what redditors say its amazing my skin texture improved dramatically after a few days my pores are smaller and tighter no more filaments around my nose no more redness or uneven skin tone skin feels soft plump and glowy pantone877 what i thought perhaps my biggest kinship with sca members is my strong belief in chemical exfoliation and this is the one that made me a believer for an allinone approach to chemical exfoliation this is the night serum from drunk elephant a brand thats as close to universally beloved as it gets to make sure the glycolic acid is safe for regular use i spoke with new york dermatologist dr dendy engelman this serum contains glycolic acid derived from sugarcane the smallest acid molecule which penetrates further and effectively breaks down dead weak skin cells dr engelman says her only warning is that not everyones skin can handle a chemical exfoliant every day mine can but as they say on reddit ymmv your mileage may vary or more simply everyones skin is different ive used this night serum pretty religiously for more than a year now and the rumors are true your skin will look better by morning the formula contains a 12 percent blend of ahas and bhas which resurface and decongest skin minus any potentially irritating ingredients going the sensitiveskin route when it comes to acids is a sound decision whether youre actually sensitive or not if you cant tell i absolutely love this product it is expensive it is worth it drunk elephant tlc framboos glycolic night serum 90 at sephora the ordinary vitamin c suspension 23 ha spheres 2 what redditors say from my experience in using it a couple months i absolutely love it and i started to notice a difference pretty quickly i think it took about a week for me to really notice but my skin started to gain a lot of healthy colour and life back from its initial sallowness chromatistic what i thought the reddit beginner skincare routine suggests a phbalanced cleanser chemical exfoliant moisturizer and spf the ordinarys vitamin c is phbalanced which supposedly approximates your skins own natural barrier most products are too alkaline at just 8 this oftsoldout cream contains 23 percent pure lascorbic acid which remains stable thanks to a waterfree formulation combined with dehydrated spheres of hyaluronic acid to help smooth skin if youre not used to the consistency it feels almost like a gentle facial scrub theres some grittiness that i dont love but the ordinary also has a smoother formulation vitamin c suspension 30 in silicone if you need more of a reason to be adding the antioxidant vitamin c into your routine know that it ups your skins natural sun protection brightens your skin strengthens the skin barrier and is known to prevent signs of aging and let me mention again it costs 8 6 at sephora what redditors say no white cast lightly tinted totally matte finish and as a bonus this makes your skin look amazing it has a smoothingblurring effect that is better than any makeup crumpetsandtea543 what i thought this is the rare mineral sunscreen with a foundationlike tint rather than the typical white cast thats just light enough for combinationoily skin its a best seller at paulas choice for that exact reason paulas choice is a brand favorite of redditors the companys website is just as much a skincare encyclopedia as it is a store if you need more colorcorrection or coverage you can layer foundation on top with ease i found it to be a terrific lightweight daily option that felt hydrating takes care of spf and most importantly of all doesnt clog my pores the slight tint even works as an instant complexion perfecter im so happy i discovered this that ive been keeping it in my rotation ever since

    "text": "in rules real world trading comments share realworld trading rwt also called realworld item trading rwit is the act of trading anything outside of runescape usually realworld money for runescape items or services or vice versa it is illegal activity in runescape subjected to severe consequences it involves paying realworld money to get gold items or skill levels ingame and vice versa legally every item in runescape is the property of jagex and therefore can not be considered as personal property of the player players who conduct rwt violate the rules and may risk being permanently banned without warning there are two general kinds of realworld traders personal sellers and companies personal sellers are people who exchange virtual items and real money between friends and do it on a more casual basis while larger groups and companies engaged in this practice via websites and on a more public and formal basis both kinds of rwt are considered violations of the rules and are treated identically by jagex if evidence is presented or found to suggest a rwt action has occurred or is being arranged contents show rule breaking realworld item traders often get money and items ingame through devious means they use bots to goldfarm money and items exploit bugs in the game and scam players of their items and accounts thus making them the cause of the majority of rulebreaking ingame because realworld trading is against runescape s rules some players have tried to find legal loopholes such as claiming that the real money is paid for the time spent that the transfers of real and virtual items are independent or even that they were selling a joke and it came with an account or money however jagex still says that these methods are against rules over time jagex has banned many players for this behaviour and has implemented some updates ingame to stop this but it has not been without controversy rationale for being against rwt see also macro some mmorpgs have been known to encourage rwt and have even provided legal means to engage in trading items for realworld money for some of these games there are even stores that allow you to buy ingame currency or to be able to unlock special features of the game andrew gower one of the cofounders of jagex and the original developer who created runescape pointed out that introducing the ability to engage in realworld item trading significantly modifies player behaviour and puts players with access to significant reallife financial resources on an unfair footing with other players distorting many aspects of game play and changing the relationship between the company and players as a longtime multiplayer game player himself mr gower saw the impact of realworld item trades and how it changed the behaviour of players who obtained these items in other games mr gower left the company before the main games microtransactions such as the squeal of fortune treasure hunter and solomons general store were placed into the game this is one rule that was established at the very beginning when runescape was still being designed and before any players even started to play this game an example of how this distorts the game play is in particular with gold farmers or resource gatherers that work for the rwt companies while macros or bots are sometimes used for automating boring tasks there are sometimes employees of the rwt companies who also are playing runescape with other more normal players however their purpose in being in the game is not necessarily to have fun or to try different things out they are actually getting paid to perform menial tasks like chopping logs mining ore or engaging in other resource gathering some of these accounts are shared between multiple employees so it isnt unusual for an account to be used 24 hours per day usually for some tasks where a player would eventually get bored with doing the same repetitive actions over and over again the gold farmers camp out in resource gathering areas for more efficient collecting as these are not programs but actual live people antimacro measures such as the random events can not prevent this by facilitating some sort of exchange to take place between the virtual currencies and realworld currencies it may open up legal liabilities issues for jagex and the player community for realworld taxation laws including income taxes violations of gambling laws in many countries or political jurisdictions and regulatory oversight by banking institutions and the financial ministries or executive departments like the us irs over ingame content this sort of complex government regulation is something companies like jagex often try to avoid by not facilitating rwt or even permitting it at all jagex is able to avoid having to report to rwt criminal behaviour upon review of the kinds of individuals involved with rwt and in particular the corporate entities involved with this trade discoveries of other sorts of reallife criminal activity has also taken place by these organisations other criminal activities also occur including money laundering where financial transactions from other criminal activity is included with income from rwt activities to legitimize the income and to help provide capital resources for funding other criminal enterprises there is even a chance to get robbed perhaps the most significant issue that jagex had to directly face was the use of stolen credit cards being used to pay for membership fees by rwt organisations credit card information was obtained from other criminal activities and then used to help pay for the gold farmer accounts on member worlds where after a certain period of time it would be reported that the card was stolen when this happens the vendor in this case jagex is required by the credit card agreements to refund the unauthorized spending this issue very directly impacted jagex from a fiscal standpoint and represented a significant loss of income for jagex according to jagex what ultimately proved to be the final breaking point for jagex was when several of the banks that provided the credit card processing services for jagex started to charge a much higher processing fee due to the excessive number of chargebacks that were happening compared to other internetbased companies it should be noted that jagex wasnt necessarily singled out individually as nearly all online gaming companies have had to address this issue to one extent or another in addition these banks threatened to completely cut off these financial services report jagex to various credit bureaus as a fraudulent enterprise and the removal of realworldtraders jagexs initial response on the runescape december behind the scenes 2007 article jagex informed everyone that they would be taking extreme measures in order to finally be rid of rwt a quote from the article on a more serious note many of you will be aware of our efforts to stop realworld trading and how some of our recent updates have been part of that you may have questions about it what does it mean how does it affect the game how big a problem is it what are the ways of dealing with it to answer these questions and more well be releasing a very important development diary on the subject jagexs actions on 10 december 2007 jagex created a development diary to explain what theyve done with realworld trading they found nearly every way possible to keep it from happening including removing unbalanced trading and making a limit on how much people can stake in the duel arena changing the way dropped items act modifying the party room and getting rid of player killing in the wilderness which was a favourite activity of some players to replace pking jagex added a new an activity called bounty hunter in this you are assigned a single player in the arena to kill although you are still free to attack or be attacked by anyone albeit with some penalties they also released clan wars a game where you and your clan go up against another clan in a war of up to twohundred fighters to compensate for the loss of playerkillers jagex also added very dangerous and powerful monsters called revenants in the wilderness in order to make the wilderness dangerous even without actual players to attack you much later jagex also made pvp worlds where players can attack each other anywhere in the world except in some banks and guilds players reactions due to these updates riots broke out all across runescape most notably in the pay to pk riot at falador on world 66 there were also many smaller riots going on around and thousands of players reportedly quit the game there was a common misconception that players that quit the game would cost jagex money however the loss of tens of thousands of member rwts far outweighed the loss of a few thousand quitting players jagexs stance jagex claimed that realworld trading had been much more devastating to runescape not only had there been illegal trades of money for items and gold but it caused many larger problems jagex stated that many rwts committed credit card fraud by using stolen credit card numbers to pay for their p2p goldfarming accounts and costing jagex a large amount of money however normally credit card companies normally pay for any credit card fraud so it is unclear how jagex believes this to cost them money especially as they increase the total number of payments by doing so it is unclear why jagex believes they would pay directly with credit cards to jagex rather than emptying bank accounts realworld traders reactions since the updates most of the various realworld trading companies began requesting the customers account password and bank pin and then farm the gold on the customers account similar to powerlevelling as this is one of the only options left for realworld trading another method was transferring the items between accounts via bounty hunter however bounty hunter was later removed making this no longer possible as bounty hunter has returned however it currently remains a possible option today due to the free trade and wilderness update most companies do not require your password for gold orders and will meet face to face at a certain time to transfer your gold controversies runefest 2010 on 28 april 2010 jagex added a new option to the ingame npc diango allowing players who had purchased a ticket for runefest 2010 to exchange a code to receive a unique ingame item the flagstaff of festivities those who had bought tickets for the runefest 2010 event were emailed item codes for each ticket which they had purchased a great deal of controversy was therefore sparked on the runescape official forums as players felt that due to the requirement of purchasing a ticket to obtain the item jagex were participating in realworld trading or microtransactions therefore going against jagexs apparent stance on realworld trading and their initial statement of it not being in the spirit of the game the defence jagex used was questionable arguing that the players were not buying the flagstaff but tickets to an event which is exactly the logic that jagex refuted when raised as a defence in certain rwt activities exclusive item membership card promotion on 14 june 2011 jagex started a promotion in which american customers buying membership cards would also receive the exclusive ingame ornate katana the only way to obtain the katana is by purchasing a 90day membership card at a gamestop location within the united states between 20 june and 10 july people who subscribe from other countries use other methods buy membership cards from other stores or for different durations or purchase membership on other days can not obtain the katana the controversy was not just because of the selling of an ingame item but also because the promotion is exclusive to the point that most members either could not obtain the item without great inconvenience an expense this offer was advertised on the main page but not within an article some people in the runescape community felt that jagex was actually performing rwt themselves in this update runefest 2011 the runefest website was updated to announce that yet another item would be given to those who purchase tickets for runefest 2011 in the faq it was announced flagstaffs are so last year but dont worry this year attendees will still get something awesome to show off ingame similar to the runefest controversy the previous year many players see this as jagex participating in realworld trading banned account reinstatement banned account reinstatements allow banned players to pay jagex realworld money to get their accounts unbanned however with a severe rollback to both stats and items on the account many players consider it controversial as some players see it as realworld trading whether an account can receive a banned account reinstatement or not is completely at jagexs discretion not every banned account may participate in this refer a friend programme this update grants members who refer a prospective user an experience boost of 10 to all their skills for one week this will only apply should the new player also purchase runescape membership and following this they too will receive an xp boost in any skill under level 30 the programme sparked much outrage amongst players all across runescape who staged a large refer a friend riot on world 66 the most common server for demonstrations and riots the players accused jagex of realworld trading due to the fact that by paying realworld money new members could be given a free experience boost along with the player that referred them many players also felt that granting these boosts would greatly encourage and profit macro accounts which is an offence that can result in a permanent ban hundreds of players took part in a riot in falador square shouting such things as ban the bots we pay we say and welcome to botscape our belief is that 25 million xp out of 250 million xp is not a lot if someone is committed enough to get that amount of xp the 10 extra is not going to make any difference to them as for the difference between jagex rwting and rwt companies doing it is that we do it without negatively impacting on runescape and use the revenue generated to make runescape better rwt companies create the bots bot the game at the expense of players and keep the cash everytime we sell membership we are realworld trading runescape wouldnt exist if we didnt do it mod mat k go green for halloween green skin this update allowed players to change their skin green but to make this option available for good you had to buy and redeem a 30 or 35 day membership card between 20 october 2011 4 november 2011 golden scythe this item was given only to 25 select players who attended runefest 2011 and as this event had an entry fee real money was used to get a chance at winning the item squeal of fortune on 2 april 2012 jagex introduced the ability to purchase spins on the squeal of fortune possible rewards from the squeal of fortune include money and experience this meant that players could buy experience rare items and gold in much the same way as they could from realworld trading companies removal of reallife ability paragraph in rule on 6 april 2012 jagex removed the following paragraph from the rwt rule we dont want players to be able to buy their way to success in runescape if we let players start doing this it devalues runescape for others we feel your status in reallife shouldnt affect your ability to be successful in runescape many players demanded an explanation from jagex about the removal of the paragraph from the rules because it was previously used as reasoning when other controversial updates were implemented some players believe the paragraph was removed because of jagexs recent stance on marketing with the implementation of updates such as the squeal of fortune and refer a friend programme according to mod moltare the squeal of fortune and refer a friend programme are not realworld trading because realworld trading is a third partytothird party situation subsequently in october 2013 bonds were introduced which effectively allow players to purchase ingame wealth from other players via a form of credit bought from jagex examples trading between runescape and runescape classic was considered rwt because jagex treats them as two separate games however following the release of old school runescape mod mark has said there is no rule against trading between games selling forum signatures is against the rules this was a common practice until jagex clarified the rules some players have been known to sell codes for runefest items for gp or real money it is debatable whether this is considered as rwt as the items could be considered to exist both in reallife and ingame the scratchoff card containing the code is a real item that could be used to obtain the item in the game jagex has said that returning a reallife gift with an ingame gift or vice versa is technically rwt although this would normally be unpunished provided that its done in the spirit of friendship buying membership for another player in exchange of runescape items was not allowed this was also a common practice in the early days when the rules were not clarified now it is technically possible through the exchange of bonds between players and the forthcoming consumption of the bond for membership services mod emilee ornate katana

subject must satisfy rfc 2047 message message to be sent each line should be separated with a crlf rn lines should not be larger than 70 characters caution windows only when php is talking to a smtp server directly if a full stop is found on the start of a line it is removed to counteract this replace these occurrences with a double dot php text str_replace n n text additional_headers optional string or array to be inserted at the end of the email header this is typically used to add extra headers from cc and bcc multiple extra headers should be separated with a crlf rn if outside data are used to compose this header the data should be sanitized so that no unwanted headers could be injected if an array is passed its keys are the header names and its values are the respective header values note before php 5442 and 5527 repectively additional_headers did not have mail header injection protection therefore users must make sure specified headers are safe and contains headers only ie never start mail body by putting multiple newlines note when sending mail the mail must contain a from header this can be set with the additional_headers parameter or a default can be set in phpini failing to do this will result in an error message similar to warning mail sendmail_from not set in phpini or custom from header missing the from header sets also returnpath under windows note if messages are not received try using a lf n only some unix mail transfer agents most notably qmail replace lf by crlf automatically which leads to doubling cr if crlf is used this should be a last resort as it does not comply with rfc 2822 additional_parameters optional the additional_parameters parameter can be used to pass additional flags as command line options to the program configured to be used when sending mail as defined by the sendmail_path configuration setting for example this can be used to set the envelope sender address when using sendmail with the f sendmail option this parameter is escaped by escapeshellcmd internally to prevent command execution escapeshellcmd prevents command execution but allows to add additional parameters for security reasons it is recommended for the user to sanitize this parameter to avoid adding unwanted parameters to the shell command since escapeshellcmd is applied automatically some characters that are allowed as email addresses by internet rfcs can not be used mail can not allow such characters so in programs where the use of such characters is required alternative means of sending emails such as using a framework or a library is recommended the user that the webserver runs as should be added as a trusted user to the sendmail configuration to prevent a xwarning header from being added to the message when the envelope sender f is set using this method for sendmail users this file is etcmailtrustedusers return values returns true if the mail was successfully accepted for delivery false otherwise it is important to note

message implode rn headers note if intending to send html or otherwise complex mails it is recommended to use the pear package pearmail_mime notes note the windows implementation of mail differs in many ways from the unix implementation first it doesnt use a local binary for composing messages but only operates on direct sockets which means a mta is needed listening on a network socket which can either on the localhost or a remote machine second the custom headers like from cc bcc and date are not interpreted by the mta in the first place but are parsed by php as such the to parameter should not be an address in the form of something someoneexamplecom the mail command may not parse this properly while talking with the mta note it is worth noting that the mail function is not suitable for larger volumes of email in a loop this function opens and closes an smtp socket for each email which is not very efficient for the sending of large amounts of email see the pearmail and pearmail_queue packages note the following rfcs may be useful rfc 1896 rfc 2045 rfc 2046 rfc 2047 rfc 2048 rfc 2049 and rfc 2822 see also imap_mail send an email message pearmail pearmail_mime add a note user contributed notes up down 18 anonymous 1 year ago security advice although it is not documented for the parameters to and subject the mail function changes at least r and n to space so these parameters are safe against injection of additional headers but you might want to check to for commas as these separate multiple addresses and you might not want to send to more than one recipient the crucial part is the additional_headers parameter this parameter cant be cleaned by the mail function so it is up to you to prevent unwanted r or n to be inserted into the values you put in there otherwise you just created a potential spam distributor up down 10 charles dot fisher at arconic dot com 1 year ago i migrated an application to a platform without a local transport agent mta i did

executable which php uses on linuxmac not windows expects n as a line separator this executable is a standard and emulated by other mtas n is confirmed required for qmail and postfix probably also for sendmail and exim but i have not tested if you pass through using rn as a separator it may appear to work but your email will be subtly corrupted and some middleware may break it only works because some systems will clean up your mistake if you are implementing dkim be very careful as dkim checks will fail at least on popular validation tools if you screw this up dkim must be calculated using rn but then you must switch it all to n when using the php mail function on windows however you should use rn because php is using smtp in this situation and hence the normal rules of the smtp protocol not the normal rules of unix piping apply up down 5 php at simoneast dot net 1 year ago often its helpful to find the exact error message that is triggered by the mail function while the function doesnt provide an error directly you can use error_get_last when mail returns false php success mail exampleexamplecom my subject message if success errormessage error_get_last message tested successfully on windows which uses smtp by default but sendmail on linuxosx may not provide the same level of detail thanks to httpsstackoverflowcoma20203870195835 up down 3 abomb 6 years ago i was having delivery issues from this function to gmail yahoo aol etc i used the notes here to figure that you need to be setting your returnpath to a valid email to catch bounces there are two extra delivery gotchas on top of that 1 the domain in the email used in the f option in the phpini sendmail parameter or in the mail extra parameters field needs to have a valid spf record for the domain in dns as a txt record type for sure and add an additional spf type record if possible why thats header field being used for spam checks 2 you should also use a domain key or dkim the trick here is that the domain keydkim is case sensitive i used cpanel to create my domain key which automatically used all lowercase domain names in the key creation i found when sending email and using a camel case f accountmydomainherecom option my key was not accepted however it was accepted when i used f accountmydomainherecom there are many other factors that can contribute to mail not getting to inboxes including your own multiple failed testing attempts so i suggest you consult each sites guidelines and dont ask me for help these are just the couple technical issues that helped my case i hope this

this function on windows systems vs unix systems on windows it delivers directly to an smtp server while on a unix system it uses a local command to hand off to the systems own mta the upshot of all this is that on a windows system your message and headers must use the standard line endings rn as prescribed by the email specs on a unix system the mtas sendmail interface assumes that recieved data will use unix line endings and will turn any n to rn so you must supply only n to mail on a unix system to avoid the mta hypercorrecting to rrn if you use plain old n on a windows system some mtas will get a little upset qmail in particular will refuse outright to accept any message that has a lonely n without an accompanying r up down 1 jim at jimbrooking dot net 2 years ago i recently changed hosting companies and spent a day trying to see why an email script that had been working for years failed on the new server the answer was that the old hosting companys email server accepted multiple

both cases phps mail function returned no error but until i placed both emails commaseparated in the same line i was getting the following error 550 messages should have one or no cc headers not 2 hope this helps someone up down 1 alex jaspersen 11 years ago for qmail users i have written a function that talks directly to qmailqueue rather than going through the sendmail wrapper used by mail thus it allows more direct control over the message for example you can adapt the function to display undisclosed recipients in to the to header it also performs careful validation of the email addresses passed to it making it more difficult for spammers to exploit your scripts please note that this function differs from the mail function in that the from address must be passed as a _separate_ argument it is automatically put into the message headers and _does not_ need to be included in additional_headers to can either be an array or a single address contained in a string message should not contain any carriage return characters only linefeeds no validation is performed on additional_headers this is mostly unnecessary because qmail will ignore any additional to headers injected by a malicious user however if you have some strange mail setup it might be a problem the function returns false if the message fails validation or is rejected by qmailqueue and returns true

822 is very explicit in stating that rn is the only acceptable line break format in the headers though is a little vague about the message body while many mtas will deal with just n ive run accross plenty of them that will exhibit interesting behaviours when this happens those mtas that are strict in compliance will definitely break when header lines are terminated with only n they will also most likely break if the body of the message note that rfc 821 is a little more clear in defining line a a sequence of ascii characters ending with a crlf rfc 821 makes no distinction between header lines and message body lines since both are actually transmitted during the data phase bottom line best practice is to be sure to convert any bare n characters in the message to rn the maximum total length of a text line including the crlf is 1000 characters rfc 821 up down 6 bigtree at dontspam dot 29a dot nl 11 years ago since lines in additional_headers must be separated by n on unix and rn on windows it might be useful to use the php_eol constant which contains the correct value on either platform note that this variable was introduced in php 502 so to write portable code that also works in php versions before that use the following code to make sure it exists php if defined php_eol define php_eol strtoupper substr php_os 0 3 win rn n up down 9 yarik dot bohatsky at gmail dot com 6

    "text": "in artificial consciousness phenomenal and access conciousness contents show ned block 1955 ned block is in the nyu department of philosophy two types of consciousness according to block 1 phenomenal consciousness is experience the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state the mark of accessconsciousness by contrast is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action block feels that it is possible to have phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness independently of each other but in general they do interact there is no generally agreed upon way of categorizing different types of consciousness blocks distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness tries to distinguish between conscious states that either do or do not directly involve the control of thought and action phenomenal consciousness according to block phenomenal consciousness results from sensory experiences such as hearing smelling tasting and having pains block groups together as phenomenal consciousness the experiences of sensations feelings perceptions thoughts wants and emotions block excludes from phenomenal consciousness anything having to do with cognition intentionality or with properties definable in a computer program access consciousness access consciousness is available for use in reasoning and for direct conscious control of action and speech for block the reportability of access consciousness is of great practical importance according to block reportabilityis often the best practical guide to aconsciousness note block often uses the terms pconsciousness and aconsciousness to refer to phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness also access consciousness must be representational because only representational content can figure in reasoning examples of access consciousness are thoughts beliefs and desires a potential source of confusion is that some phenomenal consciousness is also representational the key distinction to keep in mind about representational content that block would place in the access consciousness category is that the reason it is placed in the access consciousness category is because of its representational aspect elements of phenomenal consciousness are assigned to the phenomenal consciousness category because of their phenomenal content reaction an immediate point of controversy for blocks attempt to divide consciousness into the subdivisions of phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is that many people view the mind as resulting in its entirety from fundamentally computational processes this computational view of mind implies that all of consciousness is definable in a computer program so blocks attempt to describe some consciousness as phenomenal consciousness can not succeed in identifying a distinct category of conscious states as mentioned above block feels that phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness normally interact but it is possible to have access consciousness without phenomenal consciousness in particular block believes that zombies are possible and a robot could exist that is computationally identical to a person while having no phenomenal consciousness similarly block feels that you can have an animal with phenomenal consciousness but no access consciousness block believes that we can have conscious experiences that are not possible to produce by any type of computational algorithm and that the source of such experiences is the hard problem of consciousness blocks position with respect to consciousness is analogous to that of vitalists who defined life as being in a category distinct from all possible physical processes biologists refute vitalism by describing the physical processes that account for life in order to refute blocks claim about the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness it is up to biologists and artificial consciousness researchers to describe computational algorithms that why are some neurobiologists and computer scientists sure that blocks dualist division of consciousness is wrong what is the source of blocks certainty that there are noncomputational forms of consciousness one example of phenomenal consciousness discussed by block is a loud noise that you do not consciously notice because you are paying attention to something else block is sure that you were aware of the noise phenomenal consciousness but just not consciously aware access consciousness many scientists would say that in this case you were not consciously aware of the noise but it is almost certain that portions of your block stresses that he makes use of introspection to distinguish between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness presumably this means that when the loud noise was not noticed it was not accessed by introspection block has thus defined a category of consciousness that is outside of our conscious awareness although he says we are aware of it in some other way and not accessed by introspection maybe it is this inaccessibility of some cases of phenomenal consciousness that motivate blocks idea that such forms of consciousness can not be computational when experiences are accessible to introspection and available for inclusion in forms of phenomenal consciousness that are open to introspection in his 1995 article block went on to discuss the more interesting cases such as if upon starting to pay attention to the load noise see above that was previously ignored the experiencer noticed that there had been some earlier experience of the noise just not of the type that we pay attention to a type of experience that had been just on the edge of access consciousness in ned blocks entry for consciousness in the 2004 oxford companion to the mind 2 he discusses another example that he feels distinguishes between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness as described by block liss 3 performed an experiment in which he presented test subjects with visual stimuli views of 4 letters the 4 letters were shown to the test subjects in two different ways 1 long stimulus eg 40 msec followed by a second visual stumulus a mask known to make the first stimulus the letters hard to identify or 2 short eg 9 msec without a second stimulus the mask subjects could identify 3 of the 4 letters on average in the short case but said they were weak and fuzzy in the long case they could identify only one letter but said they could see them all and that the letters were sharper brighter and higher in contrast this experiment suggests a double dissociation the short stimuli were phenomenally poor but perceptually and conceptually ok whereas the long stimuli were phenomenally sharp but perceptually or conceptually poor as reflected in the low reportability this experiment demonstrates a distinction between i reportability of names of the letters and ii perceptual sharpness of the image blocks definitions of these two types of consciousness leads us to the conclusion that a noncomputational process can present us with phenomenal consciousness of the forms of the letters while we can imagine an additional computational algorithm for extracting the names of the letters from their form this is why computer programs can perform character recognition the ability of a computer to perform character recognition does not imply that it has phenomenal consciousness or that it need share our ability to be consciously aware of the forms of letters that it can algorithmically match to their names reactions if blocks distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness is correct then it has important implications for attempts by neuroscientists to identify the neural correlates of consciousness and for attempts by computer scientists to produce artificial consciousness in manmade devices such as robots in particular block seems to suggest that noncomputational mechanisms for producing the subjective experiences of phenomenal consciousness must be found in order to account for the richness of human consciousness or for there to be a way to rationally endow manmade machines with a similarly rich scope of personal experiences of what it is like to be in conscious states other philosophers of consciousness such as john searle have similarly suggested that there is something fundamental about subjective experience that can not be captured by conventional computer programs many advocates of the idea that there is a fundamentally computational basis of mind feel that the phenomenal aspects of consciousness do not lie outside of the bounds of what can be accomplished by computation 4 some of the conflict over the importance of the distinction between phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness centers on just what is meant by terms such as computation program and algorithm in practical terms how can we know if it is within the power of computation program or algorithm to produce humanlike consciousness there is a problem of verification can we ever really know if we have a correct biological account of the mechanistic basis of conscious experience and how can we ever know if a robot has phenomenal consciousness many neurobiologists and computer scientists feel that philosophers such as block and searle are overlypessimistic about the power of computation program or algorithm to produce humanlike consciousness the study of computation program algorithm and consciousness is too primitive for us to be able to trust our intuitions about exactly what is possible for computational algorithms to accomplish further it may not matter what we call physical processes that can generate consciousness as long as we can figure out what they are and how to work with them thus neurobiologists and computer scientists feel justified in continuing to search for the some philosophers such as thomas nagel have claimed a fundamental distinction between the first person experience of consciousness and any third person account of the mechanisms by which consciousness is generated 5 if philosophers can be overlypessimistic about what neuroscientists and computer scientists can accomplish from the third person perspective they might also be overlyenthusiastic about the reliability of first person introspection some philosophers have been fundamentally skeptical about our ability to be certain about anything we observe from the first person perspective 6 despite any sense we me have about our inability to be be wrong about our subjective evaluations of our own consciousness it may be wise to keep an open mind and remain open to the possibility that phenomenal consciousness is not a distinct category from access consciousness for example they may be at the two ends of a continuous spectrum of consciousness for which some forms of consciousness are easier to imagine as being algorithmically generated that others the results of the experiment of liss discussed above can have several interpretations viewing printed letters can lead to activation of many different brain regions and brain processes some parts of the brain that are devoted just to visual processing make heavy contributions to our ability to form a clear mental image of the shape form and color of letters these brain regions allow us to become aware of visual features but we are almost totally unable to have any introspective insight into how we become aware of shape form and color other parts of the brain are required for most philosophers participate in introspective efforts to understand the steps involved in their own linguistic competencies introspection can allow us to be aware of mental processes that seem to have a linear sequence for the production of speech or lines of reasoning computer science also has an established history of defining explicit algorithms by which strings of words can be placed in grammatically correct orders and various theorem generating programs now exist which seem to replicate some aspects of reasoning thus introspection combined with knowledge of what computer science has and has not yet accomplished provides philosophers with certain intuitions 7 about the nature of consciousness and the nature of computation in particular block has been led to suspect that phenomenal consciousness is fundamentally outside of the range of things that can be done with programs block n 1995 on a

    "text": "is there really a difference between casual dating and a committed relationship previous next is there really a difference between casual dating and a committed relationship so you are dating a terrific person should you try to progress from casual dating to a committed relationship or just leave it alone in this day and age is there really a difference between casual dating and a committed relationship well in todays society a romantic relationship is often characterized by a title in other words the seriousness of a relationship is based on whether the individuals are casual dating or in a committed relationship most of the time casual dating also known as friends with benefits suggests that the relationship is not very serious in a casual dating situation you may be dating multiple people are you may be concentrating on the person you are casually dating you may see each other occasionally ie weekends or every couple of weeks or you may see each other every day or the majority of the week moreover casual dating may or may not include sex the exact definition and rules of casual dating depend on you and your partner and is based on your wants needs and expectations conversely a committed relationship suggests that you are in a monogamous relationship in other words you are completely committed to one another in this situation you are solely focused on one another you are not dating anyone else in the majority of cases couples that are in a serious committed relationship are interested in a possible future together ie marriage children andor a longterm romantic partnership it is important to note that both types of relationships have their advantages and disadvantages no relationship is better than the other what really matters is what type of relationship is best for you if you are wondering if there really is a difference between casual dating and a committed relationship you have come to the right place this blog will help you determine if you are ready to take the next step in your relationship seriousness of the relationship in order to be in a committed relationship both you and your partner need to agree to be serious with one another in other others you need to invest your time energy love support and affection towards your partner when you enter into a serious committed relationship your main goal is to develop a strong foundation that will last throughout time a committed couple trusts respects loves supports values and uplifts one another this couple communicates and sees each other on a regular basis they are also heavily involved in each others lives for instance a couple in a serious relationship knows each others friends relatives preferences hang out locations likes and dislikes work location hobbies etc even if they have never met their partners friends andor family they still feel like they know them due to hearing stories about them it is also not uncommon to have met each others parents andor loved ones this couple may be working towards a future together ie engagement marriage and a family on the other hand a couple who is casually dating may not have as many expectations ie longterm partnership engagement marriage andor a in a casual dating situation you may or may not communicate andor see each other on a daily or weekly basis in fact you may only see each other occasionally in addition you may not have met each others family andor friends moreover the relationship may consist purely of sex it is also important to note that there may be feelings of detachment although you may be really good friends furthermore it is not uncommon to start off casually dating only to find out that you have more in common then you originally thought in these situations casual dating often monogamy vs causal dating one of the main differences between a serious committed relationship and causal dating is that individuals in a committed relationship tend to be monogamous in other words you do not date other people in a casual dating relationship you are not required to be monogamous in fact you can date multiple people if you so choose or you can just date each other it is important to note that casual dating can lead to unfulfilled romantic feelings it can also lower your selfesteem if you are not mentally and emotionally prepared for a temporary lowkey nonserious relationship in fact a although many enter into a casual dating situation lamenting commitments there is always a possibility that one of the casual daters will fall in love and be hurt when the feelings are not returned in a committed relationship there is always the risk that you are more invested in the relationship then your partner if both of you are not 100 committed to the relationship there is the risk of infidelity and betrayal there is also the risk of investing trust and love into the relationship later to realize that the two of you are not compatible in other words emotional and physical intimacy regardless of whether you are in a committed relationship or a casual dating relationship there is a good chance you are or will be having sex the primary difference between these two types of relationships is that casual daters can have sex with multiple people without cheating on anyone in other words you are not required to be faithful to one person in a committed relationship you both agree to restrict your sexual relations with other people in other words you are not allowed to participate in sexual activities with other people in most cases there is a deeper sexual trust love and respect tend to be stronger in committed relationships why well in a committed relationship both individuals are 100 invested in the relationship in other words you are looking to build a foundation with you partner that could possible lead to a longterm relationship ie marriage andor a family you care about each others feelings both in bed and out of it moreover in most cases you are in love or on their way to being in love you care for one another deeply furthermore you are able to experience both emotional and sexual satisfaction because you know casual daters often want to have fun and date around they are not interested in being tied down to one person indefinitely this type of dating situation provides you with an opportunity to hang out go places and have fun with other couples without the restrictions and obligations associated with a committed relationship in addition casual daters tend to be younger individuals ie older teens and young adults while those in a longterm committed relationship tend to be older and more experienced in life and relationships it is important to note that younger individuals can also be in successful committed
