    "abstract": "objects associated with reward draw attention and evoke enhanced activity in visual cortex. what is the underlying mechanism? one possibility is that reward's impact on vision is mediated by unique circuitry that modulates sensory processing, selectively increasing the salience of reward-associated stimuli. alternatively, effects of reward may be part of a more general mechanism that prioritizes the processing of any beneficial object, importantly including stimuli that are associated with the evasion of loss. here, we test these competing hypotheses by having male and female humans detect naturalistic objects associated with monetary reward, the evasion of equivalent loss, or neither of these. if vision is economically normative, processing of objects associated with reward and evasion of loss should be prioritized relative to neutral stimuli. results from fmri and behavioral experiments show that this is not the case: whereas objects associated with reward were better detected and represented in ventral visual cortex, detection and representation of stimuli associated with the evasion of loss were degraded. representations in parietal cortex reveal a notable exception to this pattern, showing enhanced encoding of both reward- and loss-associated stimuli. experience-driven visual prioritization can thus be economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.significance statement normative economic models propose that gain should have the same value as evasion of equivalent loss. is human vision rational in this way? objects associated with reward draw attention and are well represented in visual cortex. this is thought to have evolutionary origins, highlighting objects likely to provide benefit in the future. but benefit can be conferred not only through gain, but also through evasion of loss. here we demonstrate that the visual system prioritizes real-world objects presented in images of natural scenes only when these objects have been associated with reward, not when they have provided the opportunity to evade financial loss. visual selection is thus non-normative and economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.",

    "abstract": "cell aggregates, or spheroids, have been used as building blocks to fabricate scaffold-free tissues that can closely mimic the native three-dimensional in vivo environment for broad applications including regenerative medicine and high throughput testing of drugs. the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) into spheroids permits the manipulation of spheroids into desired shapes, patterns, and tissues using magnetic forces. current strategies incorporating mnps often involve cellular uptake, and should therefore be avoided because it induces adverse effects on cell activity, viability, and phenotype. here, we report a janus structure of magnetic cellular spheroids (jmcs) with spatial control of mnps to form two distinct domains: cells and extracellular mnps. this separation of cells and mnps within magnetic cellular spheroids was successfully incorporated into cellular spheroids with various cellular and extracellular compositions and contents. the amount of cells that internalized mnps was quantified and showed that jmcss resulted in significantly lower internalization (35%) compared to uptake spheroids (83%, p < 0.05). furthermore, the addition of mnps to cellular spheroids using the janus method has no adverse effects on cellular viability up to seven weeks, with spheroids maintaining at least 82% viability over 7 weeks when compared to control spheroids without mnps. by safely incorporating mnps into cellular spheroids, results demonstrated that jmcss were capable of magnetic manipulation, and that magnetic forces used during magnetic force assembly mediate fusion into controlled patterns and complex tissues. finally, jmcss were assembled and fused into a vascular tissue construct 5 mm in diameter using magnetic force assembly.",

    "abstract": "electronic health record (ehr) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. although ehr researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. for example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. we study whether ehr research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. we show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. we perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. in the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. the second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. in the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. we conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. we observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). aggregating ehr data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale ehr analyses. this paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases.",

    "abstract": "cellular prion protein (prpc), the infective agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, is thought to be related to several cellular physiological and physiopathological processes. we have previously reported that prpc participates in multi-drug-resistance of gastric cancer. as the salient ligand molecule of prp for participating in internalization and propagation of the scrapie form of prion protein (prpsc), 37 kda laminin receptor precursor protein (37lrp) shared the same gene coding sequence of mgr1-ag, another protein previously found to be involved in multi-drug-resistance of gastric cancer in our lab. in the present study, we explored whether mgr1-ag/37lrp contributed to prpc mediated multi-drug-resistance in gastric cancer. immunohistochemical staining showed similar expression patterns of mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer tissue serial sections. western blot and immunohistochemistry also demonstrated correlative expression of mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer cell lines. interaction between mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues were verified by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. furthermore, knockdown of mgr1-ag/37lrp significantly attenuated prpc induced multi-drug-resistance by sensitizing drug-induced apoptosis through inhibition of akt activation. in conclusion, mgr1-ag/37lrp may interact with prpc and promote the prpc induced multi-drug-resistance in gastric cancer through pi3k/akt pathway. the current study elucidates the mechanism of how prpc triggers intracellular signaling cascade resulting in multi-drug-resistance phenotype and provides a novel candidate molecular target against gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "a model linking within- and between-host pathogen dynamics via pathogen shedding (emission of pathogens throughout the course of infection) is developed, and several aspects of host availability and co-infection are considered. in this model, the rate of pathogen shedding affects both the pathogen population size within a host (also affecting host mortality) and the rate of infection of new hosts. our goal is to ascertain how the rate of shedding is likely to evolve, and what factors permit coexistence of alternative shedding rates in a pathogen population. for a constant host population size (where an increase in infected hosts necessarily decreases susceptible hosts), important differences arise depending on whether pathogens compete only for susceptible (uninfected) hosts, or whether co-infection allows for competition for infected hosts. with no co-infection, the pathogen type that can persist with the lowest number of susceptible hosts will outcompete any other, which under the assumptions of the model is the pathogen with the highest basic reproduction number. this is often a pathogen with a relatively high shedding rate (s). if within-host competition is allowed, a trade-off develops due to the conflicting effects of shedding on within- and between-host pathogen dynamics, with within-host competition favoring clones with low shedding rates while between-host competition benefits clones with higher shedding rates. with within-host competition for the same host cells, low shedding rate clones should eliminate high-s clones in a co-infected host, if equilibrium is reached. with co-infection, but no within-host competition, pathogen clones still interact by affecting the mortality of co-infected hosts; here, coexistence is more likely. with co-infection, two clones can coexist if one is the superior competitor for uninfected hosts and the other for co-infected hosts.",

    "abstract": "introduction angina is the cardinal symptom of chronic coronary syndrome (ccs), which is the leading cause of death worldwide. as such, the control of angina is important. the current guidelines recommend beta blockers (bb) or calcium channel blockers to reduce angina, yet many patients with stable angina remain symptomatic. it has been suggested that combining trimetazidine (tmz), an anti-ischemic agent, with a bb is beneficial for symptomatic patients. bisoprolol, a bb, is often used to treat patients with ccs, yet no data are currently available regarding the efficacy of bisoprolol combined with tmz in patients who remain symptomatic despite receiving bisoprolol. methods the aim of this post-hoc analysis of the choice-2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tmz 35mg twice daily in combination with different bisoprolol doses in symptomatic patients with stable angina patients receiving hemodynamic therapy in a real-world clinical setting. results this analysis involved 221 patients (mean [ standard deviation] age 64.88.9 years) with stable angina. the mean number of weekly angina episodes gradually fell from 6.25.3 at inclusion (m0) to 1.51.9 at 6months after treatment initiation (m6) with combined tmz-bisoprolol therapy (p<0.001). the number of patients assessed to be angina-free increased almost sixfold from 5.4% (12/221) at m0 to 33.9% (74/221) at m6. exercise capacity improved, as measured by walking distance, from 308207m at m0 to 497253m at m6 (p<0.05). the number of patients with canadian cardiovascular society class 1 angina increased by tenfold during the study, whereas those with class 3 angina decreased by threefold. conclusion the tmz-bisoprolol combination is a rapidly effective treatment for reducing the frequency of angina attacks and the use of short-acting nitrates in patients with stable angina in a real-world clinical setting. the benefits of this combination therapy was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment initiation and the treatment was well tolerated. trial registration isrctn identifier: isrctn65209863.",

    "abstract": "hypertrehalosemic hormone (hth) is a peptide hormone that belongs to the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment concentrating hormone (akh/rpch) family, which exerts pleiotropic actions related to catabolic reaction and stress response. akh peptides have been demonstrated to participate in stress response including oxidative stress in several insects. in order to study the signaling pathway of hth involved in anti-oxidative stress, we have characterized a hih receptor cdna in blattella germanica (blage-hthr) in structural and in functional terms using rna interference (rnai). blage-hthr is expressed in various female adult tissues (brain-cc-ca, ventral nerve cord, midgut, fat body, oviduct), but maximal expression is observed in the fat body. rnai-mediated knockdown of blage-hthr expression results in a significantly lower level of hemolymph trehalose, even though hth is exogenously administered. paraquat elicits lethal oxidative stress in b. germanica, and co-injection of paraquat and hth reduces this detrimental effect and extends the median survival time. interestingly, the \"rescue\" effect of hth on mortality caused by paraquat is diminished in specimens with depleted expression of blage-hth and blage-hthr. finally, lipid peroxidation in the hemolymph increases 4h after paraquat treatment, in comparison with control specimens or with hth-treated specimens. however, lipid peroxidation induced by paraquat was not \"rescued\" by hth in blage-hth and blage-hthr knockdown specimens. our results demonstrate that hth acts as a stress hormone mediating anti-oxidative protection in b. germanica, and that its receptor, blage-hthr, is essential for this action.",

    "abstract": "background transradial arterial access (tra) for cerebral diagnostic angiography is associated with fewer access site complications than transfemoral access (tfa). however, concerns about increased procedure time and radiation exposure with tra may slow its adoption. our objective was to measure tra rates of success and fluoroscopy time per vessel after 'radial-first' adoption and to compare these rates to those obtained with tfa. methods we examined 500 consecutive cerebral angiograms on an intent-to-treat basis during the first full year of radial-first adoption, recording patient and procedural characteristics and outcomes. results over a 9-month period at a single center, 457 of 500 angiograms (91.4%) were performed with intent-to-treat via tra, and 431 cases (86.2%) were ultimately performed via tra. one patient (0.2%) experienced a temporary neurologic deficit in the tra group, and none (0%) did in the tfa group (p=0.80). the meansd fluoroscopy time per vessel decreased significantly from the first half of the study to the second half for tra (5.03.8 vs 3.43.5min/vessel; p<0.001), while tfa time remained unchanged (3.71.8 vs 3.51.4min/vessel; p=0.69). the median fluoroscopy time per vessel for tra became faster than that for tfa after 150 angiograms. conclusion of 500 consecutive angiograms performed during the first full year of radial-first implementation, 86.2% were performed successfully using tra. tra efficiency exceeded that of tfa after 150 angiograms. concerns about the length of procedure or radiation exposure should not be barriers to tra adoption.",

    "abstract": "objective graves' disease (gd) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. in many cases, when the aetiological diagnosis of gd is not evident based on the clinical evaluation and thyroid function testing, it may become challenging to distinguish graves' hyperthyroidism from other forms of thyrotoxicosis. the current study was primarly carried out to compare the diagnostic effectiveness of two tsh receptor antibody immunoassays (imas), ultrasonography and thyroid scintigraphy in hyperthyroidism scenario. methods we retrospectively analysed consecutive patients with newly diagnosed and untreated thyrotoxicosis who underwent thyroid functional tests, both trab and tsi measurements, thyroid scintigraphy and ultrasonography. trab assessment was carried out by kryptor\u00ae\ufe0f compact plus, while tsi by immulite\u00ae\ufe0f . echo pattern 3 corresponded to 'thyroid inferno', and the final diagnosis of gd vs non-graves' hyperthyroidism was made according to the thyroid scan (qualitative scintigraphy). receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were drawn using the final diagnosis as reference. clinical sensitivity and specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) were calculated for all the tests. results a total of 124 untreated hyperthyroid patients were included in our study (gd, n=86 vs non-graves' hyperthyroidism, n=38). roc curves showed that the optimal cut-off values associated with the highest diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was 0.7iu/l for trab kryptor\u00ae\ufe0f (93 [85.4-97.4] and 86.8 [71.9-95.5]) and 0.1iu/l for tsi immulite\u00ae\ufe0f (94.2 [86.9-98.1] and 84.2 [68.7-93.9]), respectively. for the echo pattern 3, we found a good sensitivity (92.1%) and a high ppv (95.2%) but a quite low specificity value (69.8%) and a relative low npv (57.5%). for thyroid scintigraphy, the tctu cut-off value of 1.3% corresponded to the best limit for sensitivity and specificity in our patients (95.3 [88.5-98.7] and 96.4 [81.6-99.4]). the passing-bablok regression equation and the bland-altman test showed a great degree of correlation and agreement existed between trab kryptor\u00ae\ufe0f and immulite\u00ae\ufe0f tsi results. conclusions thyroid scintigraphy remains the most accurate method to differentiate causes of thyrotoxicosis. however, trab assays can be alternatively adopted in this setting, limiting the use of thyroid scintigraphy (tctu evaluation) to trab-negative patients. thyoid us is less accurate than both trab/tsi and thyroid scintigraphy, but the 'thyroid inferno' pattern provides a high ppv for gd.",

    "title": "the impact of covid-19 management policies tailored to airborne sars-cov-2 transmission: policy analysis.",
    "abstract": "background daily new covid-19 cases from january to april 2020 demonstrate varying patterns of sars-cov-2 transmission across different geographical regions. constant infection rates were observed in some countries, whereas china and south korea had a very low number of daily new cases. in fact, china and south korea successfully and quickly flattened their covid-19 curve. to understand why this was the case, this paper investigated possible aerosol-forming patterns in the atmosphere and their relationship to the policy measures adopted by select countries. objective the main research objective was to compare the outcomes of policies adopted by countries between january and april 2020. policies included physical distancing measures that in some cases were associated with mask use and city disinfection. we investigated whether the type of social distancing framework adopted by some countries (ie, without mask use and city disinfection) led to the continual dissemination of sars-cov-2 (daily new cases) in the community during the study period. methods we examined the policies used as a preventive framework for virus community transmission in some countries and compared them to the policies adopted by china and south korea. countries that used a policy of social distancing by 1-2 m were divided into two groups. the first group consisted of countries that implemented social distancing (1-2 m) only, and the second comprised china and south korea, which implemented distancing with additional transmission/isolation measures using masks and city disinfection. global daily case maps from johns hopkins university were used to provide time-series data for the analysis. results the results showed that virus transmission was reduced due to policies affecting sars-cov-2 propagation over time. remarkably, china and south korea obtained substantially better results than other countries at the beginning of the epidemic due to their adoption of social distancing (1-2 m) with the additional use of masks and sanitization (city disinfection). these measures proved to be effective due to the atmosphere carrier potential of sars-cov-2 transmission. conclusions our findings confirm that social distancing by 1-2 m with mask use and city disinfection yields positive outcomes. these strategies should be incorporated into prevention and control policies and be adopted both globally and by individuals as a method to fight the covid-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "alginate hydrogels are gaining traction for use in drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and as tissue engineered scaffolds due to their physiological gelation conditions, high tissue biocompatibility, and wide chemical versatility. traditionally, alginate is decorated at the carboxyl group to carry drug payloads, peptides, or proteins. while low degrees of substitution do not cause noticeable mechanical changes, high degrees of substitution can cause significant losses to alginate properties including complete loss of calcium cross-linking. while most modifications used to decorate alginate deplete the carboxyl groups, we propose that alginate modifications that replenish the carboxyl groups could overcome the loss in gel integrity and mechanics. in this report, we demonstrate that restoring carboxyl groups during functionalization maintains calcium cross-links as well as hydrogel shear-thinning and self-healing properties. in addition, we demonstrate that alginate hydrogels modified to a high degree with azide modifications that restore the carboxyl groups have improved tissue retention at intramuscular injection sites and capture blood-circulating cyclooctynes better than alginate hydrogels modified with azide modifications that deplete the carboxyl groups. taken together, alginate modifications that restore carboxyl groups could significantly improve alginate hydrogel mechanics for clinical applications. statement of significance: chemical modification of hydrogels provides a powerful tool to regulate cellular adhesion, immune response, and biocompatibility with local tissues. alginate, due to its biocompatibility and easy chemical modification, is being explored for tissue engineering and drug delivery. unfortunately, modifying alginate to a high degree of substitution consumes carboxyl group, which are necessary for ionic gelation, leading to poor hydrogel crosslinking. we introduce alginate modifications that restore the alginate's carboxyl groups. we demonstrate that modifications that reintroduce carboxyl groups restore gelation and improve gel mechanics and tissue retention. in addition to contributing to a basic science understanding of hydrogel properties, we anticipate our approach will be useful to create tissue engineered scaffolds and drug delivery platforms.",

(2014) measure the contemporary response to natural selection across the genome in multiple cohorts of atlantic salmon during their first year at sea. they introduce a multilocus framework based on groups of markers that covary in their genotypic distribution. while the traditional, single-locus approach did not find evidence for repeated patterns of selection, the multivariate approach found that a group of covarying snps was selected for in different cohorts at one site. their multilocus framework has potential to be a more fruitful approach for uncovering the genomic basis of adaptation in quantitative traits, although caution should be applied as the framework has yet to be validated with simulated data.",

    "title": "a new parameterization for integrated population models to document amphibian reintroductions.",
    "abstract": "managers are increasingly implementing reintroduction programs as part of a global effort to alleviate amphibian declines. given uncertainty in factors affecting populations and a need to make recurring decisions to achieve objectives, adaptive management is a useful component of these efforts. a major impediment to the estimation of demographic rates often used to parameterize and refine decision-support models is that life-stage-specific monitoring data are frequently sparse for amphibians. we developed a new parameterization for integrated population models to match the ecology of amphibians and capitalize on relatively inexpensive monitoring data to document amphibian reintroductions. we evaluate the capability of this model by fitting it to oregon spotted frog (rana pretiosa) monitoring data collected from 2007 to 2014 following their reintroduction within the klamath basin, oregon, usa. the number of egg masses encountered and the estimated adult and metamorph abundances generally increased following reintroduction. we found that survival probability from egg to metamorph ranged from 0.01 in 2008 to 0.09 in 2009 and was not related to minimum spring temperatures, metamorph survival probability ranged from 0.13 in 2010-2011 to 0.86 in 2012-2013 and was positively related to mean monthly temperatures (logit-scale slope=2.37), adult survival probability was lower for founders (0.40) than individuals recruited after reintroduction (0.56), and the mean number of egg masses per adult female was 0.74. our study is the first to test hypotheses concerning oregon spotted frog egg-to-metamorph and metamorph-to-adult transition probabilities in the wild and document their response at multiple life stages following reintroduction. furthermore, we provide an example to illustrate how the structure of our integrated population model serves as a useful foundation for amphibian decision-support models within adaptive management programs. the integration of multiple, but related, data sets has an advantage of being able to estimate complex ecological relationships across multiple life stages, offering a modeling framework that accommodates uncertainty, enforces parsimony, and ensures all model parameters can be confronted with monitoring data.",

    "abstract": "the initiation of primordial follicle development is essential for female fertility, but the signals that trigger this process are poorly understood. given the potentially important roles of micrornas (mirnas) in the ovary, we aimed to study the expression patterns and regulatory functions of mirnas during the initiation of primordial follicle development. expression patterns of mirna in the neonatal mouse ovary were profiled by microarray, and 24 mirnas whose abundances differed significantly between ovaries from 3- and 5-day-old mice were identified. pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 48 signal transduction pathways are modulated by the up-regulated mirnas and 29 pathways are modulated by the down-regulated mirnas (p-value and false discovery rate < 0.001). a mirna-mrna regulatory network was established for tgf-beta signaling pathway-related genes. among the mirnas involved in this pathway, mir-145 was chosen for further analysis. down-regulation of mir-145 using an antagomir (at) decreased the proportion and number of the primordial follicles and increased that of the growing follicles in the cultured ovaries (p < 0.05). the mean oocyte diameter in the primordial follicles was significantly greater in the at group relative to the at-negative control group (p < 0.05), whereas the mean oocyte diameter in growing follicles was smaller in the at group than in the at-negative control group. in addition, we confirmed that mir-145 targets tgfbr2. the mir-145 at caused an increase in tgfbr2 expression and activation of smad signaling but did not affect the p38 mapk or jnk pathway. these data suggest that mirnas and the signaling pathways they modulate are involved in the initiation of primordial follicle development, and mir-145 targets tgfbr2 to regulate the initiation of primordial follicle development and maintain primordial follicle quiescence.",

(2) is adherence to glucose monitoring recommendations associated with perinatal outcomes in pregnancies that are complicated by diabetes mellitus? we hypothesized that adherence to glucose testing recommendations varies by type of diabetes mellitus and that increased adherence to testing recommendations would be associated with improved perinatal outcomes. study design this single-center, prospective cohort study included women with type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus who were enrolled in a perinatal diabetes program at <29 weeks gestation between december 2015 and june 2018. all women received a cellular-enabled glucometer that uploaded glucose values to a cloud-based, health insurance portability and accountability act-compliant platform in real time that ensured transmission of accurate glucose values. the primary outcome was adherence to self-glucose monitoring recommendations. four glucose checks were advised daily, and percentage of adherence was calculated. secondary outcomes were preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, large-for-gestational-age neonates, and neonatal hypoglycemia. the study was powered to detect a 10% difference in the primary outcome of adherence to advised self-glucose monitoring by diabetes mellitus type. adjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were generated with the use of logistic regression. results this study included 103 eligible women. baseline characteristics differed between groups, with women with type 2 diabetes mellitus having higher initial hgba1c and body mass index when compared with women with gestational diabetes mellitus. no differences were noted in age or parity. adherence was calculated over 206 weeks for women with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with 94 weeks for women with gestational diabetes mellitus. overall adherence to glucose monitoring was significantly less for women with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with those with gestational diabetes mellitus. mean testing adherence rates were 51%, 66%, and 70% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes mellitus, class a1 and a2, respectively (p=.016). we found that, for every 10% increase in adherence to testing recommendations, the odds of cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, and large-for-gestational-age fetuses decreases by 15-20%. there was no association between adherence and rates of preeclampsia. conclusion this study shows that overall adherence to testing recommendations differs by diabetes mellitus type and is associated with neonatal outcomes. improved outcomes with higher adherence may reflect more timely medication adjustments in response to real-time glucose values. programs aimed at improving adherence could prove beneficial.",

    "abstract": "while wastewater and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (pbdes) are commonly both discharged into aquatic ecosystems, little information is known about how wastewaters with different nutrient levels impact on microbial degradation of pbdes. in this study, we used an anaerobic microcosm experiment to examine how the removal rates of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (bde-47) from contaminated sediment varied when exposed to three wastewaters with different nutrient properties, namely livestock wastewater (ls), municipal sewage (ms), and shrimp pond wastewater (sp), and to determine the microbial controls on removal processes. we found that bde-47 degraded relatively rapidly in ms, which had low carbon and nitrogen concentrations, but degraded much more slowly in ls and sp, which had relatively high nutrient concentrations. the variations in bde-47 removal in different wastewater were related to iron reduction rates and the abundances of organohalide-respiring bacteria (ohrb). the community compositions of both total bacteria and ohrb from the family dehalococcoidaceae differed significantly among the wastewater treatments. compared with other treatments, some bacterial groups with pbde degradation abilities were more abundant in ms where the pbde-degradation efficiencies were higher. our results should help support evaluations of the bioremediation potential of sites that are contaminated with both halogenated organic compounds and nutrient-rich wastewater.",

    "abstract": "imatinib (im), targeting of bcr-abl1 tyrosine kinase, is currently one of the first-line choices in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (cml). this study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying im resistance in cml treatment. 108 cml patients were recruited and grouped according to their sensitivity to im as the responder group (n=66) and the non-responder group (n=42). real-time quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) was performed to evaluate the expression of candidate circular rnas (circrnas), microrna (mirnas) and messenger rna (mrnas). no significant difference was noted regarding demographic and clinicopathological characteristics between the responder group and the non-responder group. the expression of circ_0080145, circ_0051886 and abl1 mrna was significantly increased, while the expression of mir-203 and mir-637 was decreased in the non-responder group as compared with the responders. by using in-silicon analysis, it was predicted that circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 targeted mir-203 and mir-637 respectively, and abl1 was found to be shared direct target gene of mir-203 and mir-637. ectopic over-expression of circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 respectively reduced the expression of mir-203 and mir-637. the expression of abl1 mrna/protein was most upregulated in culture cells co-transfected with circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 as compared with those cells individually transfected. this study established the signaling pathways of circ_0080145/mir-203/abl1 and circ <phone>/mir-637/abl1. the deregulation of circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 is, at least partially, responsible for the development of im chemoresistance in cml by regulating expression of abl1 via modulating expression of mir-203 and mir-637.",

    "abstract": "background neurodegenerative disorders, such as parkinson's disease (pd), are characterized by neuronal death involving, among other events, mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity. along these lines, several attempts have been made to slow this pathology but none have been yet discovered. based on its capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and provide neuronal protection in vitro and in vivo, the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (pacap) represents a promising lead molecule. pharmacological studies showed that pacap interacts with three different g protein-coupled receptors, i.e. pac1, vpac1 and vpac2. however, only pac1 is associated with neuronal anti-apoptotic actions, whilst vpac activation might cause adverse effects. in the context of the development of pac1-selective agonists, pacap(1-23) (pacap23) appears as the shortest known pacap bioactive fragment. methods hence, the capacity of this peptide to bind pacap receptors and protect neuroblastoma cells was evaluated under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction and glutamate excitotoxicity. in addition, its ability to activate downstream signaling events involving g proteins (gs and gq), epac, and calcium was also assessed. results compared to the endogenous peptide, pacap23 showed a reduced affinity towards pac1, although this fragment exerted potent neuroprotection. however, surprisingly, some disparities were observed for pacap23 signaling compared to full length pacap, suggesting that downstream signaling related to neuroprotection is distinctly regulated following subtle differences in their pac1 interactions. conclusions altogether, this study demonstrates the potent neuroprotective action of amidated pacap23. general significance pacap23 represents an attractive template for development of shorter pacap-derived neuroprotective molecules.",

    "abstract": "salmonella is a major cause of foodborne disease that sometimes occurs in massive outbreaks around the world. this pathogen is tolerant of low-humidity conditions. we previously described a method for induction of viable but nonculturable (vbnc) salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and subsequent resuscitation with 0.3 mm sodium pyruvate. here, we report a new method for the induction of the vbnc state in salmonella enteritidis cells, one involving dehydration. exposure of salmonella enteritidis cells to dehydration stress under poor nutritional conditions (0.9% [wt/vol] nacl) and 10 to 20% relative humidity at room temperature decreased the presence of culturable population to 0.0067%, but respiratory and glucose uptake active populations were maintained at 0.46 and 1.12%, respectively, meaning that approximately 1% may have entered the vbnc state. furthermore, these vbnc cells could be resuscitated to acquire culturability by incubation with catalase in m9 minimal medium without glucose in a manner dependent on the dose of catalase but not sodium pyruvate. these results suggest that a low-humidity environment could cause salmonella enteritidis cells to enter the vbnc state and the cells could then be resuscitated for growth by treatment with catalase, suggesting a potential risk of salmonella enteritidis to survive in low water activity foods in the vbnc state and to start regrowth for foodborne illness.",

    "abstract": "background cervical cancer was the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide in 2012 and was the eighth most common cancer in 2014 and the eighth greatest cause of female cancer deaths in hong kong in 2015. human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccination has been clinically documented to have a high efficacy in reducing hpv-related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia incidence. therefore, receiving vaccination is a crucial public health measure to reduce disease burden. significant others, such as schools and schoolteachers, have prominent influence in shaping adolescents' health perceptions and behavior. therefore, the perspective of schools and schoolteachers regarding vaccination can significantly influence students' acceptance and accessibility of the vaccine. however, few studies have analyzed the perceptions of schoolteachers toward hpv vaccination, and even fewer have concerned how schoolteachers' perceptions influence their schools' motivation in implementing school-based hpv vaccination programs. this study was thus conducted to fill this literature gap. methods with a chinese community as the field site of this study, a qualitative approach of five focus group interviews was conducted with 35 schoolteachers from five primary and eight secondary schools in hong kong between july 2014 and january 2015. thematic content analysis was used for data analysis. results perceptual, institutional, student and parental, and collaborator barriers interacted to discourage the sampled schoolteachers from organizing school-based hpv vaccination programs. lack of knowledge regarding hpv vaccination, perception of hpv vaccination as inappropriate given the students' age, violation of traditional cultural values, lack of perceived needs and perceived risk, opposition from schools, low priority of hpv vaccination over other health education topics, lack of government support, lack of interest from parents and students, and lack of confidence in implementing organizations, all were the mentioned barriers. conclusions the sampled schoolteachers were demotivated to organize school-based hpv vaccination programs because of their perceptions and various social and cultural factors. as significant influencers of adolescent students, schoolteachers and schools should receive more support and information on organizing school-based hpv vaccination programs in the future.",

    "abstract": "research question endometrial preparation is one of the most important steps for ensuring frozen embryo transfer success. however, there is no clear evidence that identifies an optimal endometrial preparation protocol for frozen embryo transfer. in addition, in studies that assessed which were the optimal endometrial preparation protocols, few analyzed the stage and the number of embryos. this study compared the pregnancy outcomes and perinatal obstetric complications of patients who were transferred two cleavage-stage (day2orday3) frozen embryos with the natural cycle and those with the hormone replacement therapy cycle. design this study was a secondary analysis of data from a multicentre randomized controlled trial designed to compare the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes after frozen versus fresh embryo transfer. in this study, a total of 908 patients who were transferred two cleavage-stage (day2orday3) embryos in the original trial were analyzed. pregnancy outcomes and perinatal obstetric complications after the natural cycle and the hormone replacement therapy cycle were compared. result we found the endometrium in the natural group was significantly thicker than the hormone replacement therapy cycle group (p<0.01). the implantation rate (42.6% vs 37.3% p=0.049) showed a significant difference between the natural cycle group and the hormone replacement therapy cycle group. compared to the natural cycle group, the hormone replacement therapy cycle group was associated with an increased risk of caesarean section (72.3% vs 84.5, p=0.009). conclusion the natural cycle protocol yielded thicker endometria, a higher implantation rate and a lower risk of caesarean section than the hormone replacement therapy protocol in the transfer of two cleavage-stage frozen embryos. the natural cycle protocol was the better endometrial preparation protocol for frozen embryo transfer.",

    "abstract": "unlabelled hg discharged into the environmental waters can generally be bioaccumulated, transformed and transmited by living organisms, thus resulting in the formation of hg-toxicity food chains. the pathway and toxicology of food chain contaminated with environmental hg are rarely revealed by proteomics. here, we showed that differential proteomics had the potential to understand reproduction toxicity mechanism in marine molluscs through the hg-contaminated food chain. hg bioaccumulation was found in every link of the hgcl2-chlorella vulgaris-oyster-mice food chain. morphological observations identified the lesions in both the oyster gonad and the mice ovary. differential proteomics was used to study the mechanisms of hg toxicity in the oyster gonad and to find some biomarkers of hg contamination in food chain. using 2-de and maldi-tof/tof ms, we identified 13 differential protein spots, of which six were up-regulated, six were down-regulated, while one was undecided. a portion of these differential proteins was further confirmed using real-time pcr and western blotting methods. their major functions involved binding, protein translocation, catalysis, regulation of energy metabolism, reproductive functioning and structural molecular activity. among these proteins, 14-3-3 protein, gtp binding protein, arginine kinase (ak) and 71kda heat shock connate protein (hscp 71) are considered to be suitable biomarkers of environmental hg contamination. furthermore, we established the gene correspondence, responding to hg reproductive toxicity, between mouse and oyster, and then used real-time pcr to analyze mrna differential expression of the corresponding genes in mice. the results indicated that the mechanism of hg reproductive toxicity in mouse was similar to that in oyster. we suggest that the proteomics would be further developed in application research of food safety including toxicological mechanism. biological significance it is well known that mercury (hg) is one of the best toxic metal elements in nature. the research reports as previously described indicated that multiple mercury compounds can directly contaminate the aquatic animals by flowing of water body and through the diffusion of air. the pollution sources of the mercury compounds in marine water were mainly found from the pathways such as steam power plant and mineral exploitation which are located on the inshore. of note, after being released into environmental waters, mercury compounds undergo the processes of bioaccumulation, transformation and transmission in living organisms, thus resulting in the multiple forms of hg found in hg-toxicity food chains, and among them, methyl mercury (mehg) showing the high toxic characteristics is the main form of hg. the abundant reports indicated that the metal salts were easily found within the various organs of the animals, but it is difficult to judge the level of its perniciousness according to its content only in vivo. here, the algae to have been contaminated by the mercury compounds have the ability for contaminating both the fish and shellfish as food pathway quickly. if these fish and shellfish edible as food will be taken by human, they will further affect the human health badly. however, studies about their perniciousness are rarely reported, especially in using proteomics. the oysters as normal food are largely consumed in southern china, especially in xiamen city. similarly, a pathway question that the contaminated oysters can effect on the human health such as cancer is unclear or poorly understood. here, we showed that an analytical technology such as differential proteomics has potential to understand toxicity mechanism induced by hg-contamination through the food pathway. it is for reason that the oyster proteomics including relative analytical methods have been used to reveal the contaminant level and to determine its perniciousness using toxic algae as food. here, we also indicated that the research here shows great significance for both analysis of food safety and toxicology of the metal compounds. in addition, a few biomarkers have shown their strong potential for monitoring the level of hg pollution in sea in the manuscript and gene correspondence between mouse and oyster, the two contiguous links of the hg-contaminated food chain, was further investigated to better illustrate our finding in the analysis of food chain proteomics. moreover, similar research work is rarely reported compared to the current proteomic development, showing that a lot of novel results by proteomic methods in the manuscript have strong potential for developing the new area of food chain proteomics.",

    "abstract": "background type 2 diabetes (t2dm) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (ckd) in western countries. the combination of both increases the risk of end stage renal disease (esrd), cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. early control of blood pressure (bp) and proteinuria (pu) is crucial to slow down the progression of the ckd and prevent cardiovascular events and mortality. the primary objective of the study was to assess bp and pu control after a 2-year follow-up in t2dm patients with ckd. methods prospective, multicenter, observational study. overall, 153 french nephrologists included 986 t2dm patients with pu (0.5g/day) and an egfr >15ml/min/1.73m2. data from 729 patients were available after a 2-year follow-up. bp and pu control were respectively defined as less than 140/90mmhg and 0.5g/day. we also looked at renal and cardiovascular events. results at baseline, 74% of the patients were male, mean age was 70years. the mean t2dm duration was 17years with a mean hba1c of 7.4%. all were treated for hypertension and 33% had a controlled bp; 81% had dyslipidemia and ldlc was <1g/l for 54%; 44% had retinopathy, 40% macrovascular complications and 12% heart failure. mean pu was 2g/day and egfr 4020ml/min/1.73m2, with 13, 18, 32 and 37% of the patients in respectively stage 2, 3a, 3b and 4 ckd. after two years, 21% reached the pu target and 39% the bp target. the mean egfr of 4020.3ml/min/1.73m2 at baseline dropped to 33.922.6ml/min/1.73m2 by year two (p<0.001). this corresponded to a mean annual egfr reduction of 3.2ml/min/1.73m2. 118 patients presented a renal event (16.2%): doubling of serum creatinine for 86 patients (11.8%) and start of dialysis for 72 (9.9%); 176 patients (24.1%) developed at least one cardiovascular complication (mainly coronary events and acute heart failure) during the follow-up period, and among these, 50 had also developed renal complications. sixty patients died, i.e., 8.2%, 26 patients from cardiovascular causes. conclusion our study highlights that achieving bp and pu targets remains a major challenge in patients with t2dm and nephropathy. renal failure emerges as a more frequent event than death.",

    "abstract": "vestibular rehabilitation of patients in whom the level of vestibular function is continuously changing requires different strategies than in those where vestibular function rapidly becomes stable: where it recovers or where it does not and compensation is by catch-up saccades. in order to determine which of these situations apply to a particular patient, it is necessary to monitor the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) gains, rather than just make a single measurement at a given time. the video head impulse test (vhit) is a simple and practical way to monitor precisely the time course and final level of vor recovery and is useful when a patient has ongoing vestibular symptoms, such as after acute vestibular neuritis. in this study, we try to show the value of ongoing monitoring of vestibular function in a patient recovering from vestibular neuritis. acute vestibular neuritis can impair function of any single semicircular canal (scc). the level of impairment of each scc, initially anywhere between 0 and 100%, can be accurately measured by the vhit. in superior vestibular neuritis the anterior and lateral sccs are the most affected. unlike after surgical unilateral vestibular deafferentation, scc function as measured by the vor can recover spontaneously after acute vestibular neuritis. here we report monitoring the vor from all 6 sccs for 500 days after the second attack in a patient with bilateral sequential vestibular neuritis. spontaneous recovery of the vor in response to anterior and lateral scc impulses showed an exponential recovery with a time to reach stable levels being longer than previously considered or reported. vor gain in response to low-velocity lateral scc impulses recovered with a time constant of around 100 days and reached a stable level at about 200 days. however, in response to high-velocity lateral scc and anterior scc impulses, vor gain recovered with a time constant of about 150 days and only reached a stable level toward the end of the 500 days monitoring period.",

    "abstract": "in this review we stress the differences between eukaryotes and bacteria with respect to their different cell cycles, replication mechanisms and genome organizations. one of the most basic and underappreciated differences is that a bacterial chromosome uses only one ori while eukaryotic chromosome uses multiple oris. consequently, eukaryotic oris work redundantly in a cell cycle divided into separate phases: first inactive replication proteins assemble on eukaryotic oris, and then they await conditions (in the separate \"s-phase\") that activate only the ori-bound and pre-assembled replication proteins. s-phase activation (without re-assembly) ensures that a eukaryotic ori \"fires\" (starts replication) only once and that each chromosome consistently duplicates only once per cell cycle. this precise chromosome duplication does not require precise multiple ori firing in s-phase. a eukaryotic ori can fire early, late or not at all. the single bacterial ori has no such margin for error and a comparable imprecision is lethal. single ori usage is not more primitive; it is a totally different strategy that distinguishes bacteria. we further argue that strong evolutionary pressures created more sophisticated single ori systems because bacteria experience extreme and rapidly changing conditions. a bacterial ori must rapidly receive and process much information in \"real-time\" and not just in \"cell cycle time.\" this redefinition of bacterial oris as centralized information processors makes at least two important predictions: first that bacterial oris use many and yet to be discovered control mechanisms and second that evolutionarily distinct bacteria will use many very distinct control mechanisms. we review recent literature that supports both predictions. we will highlight three key examples and describe how negative-feedback, phospho-relay, and chromosome-partitioning systems act to regulate chromosome replication. we also suggest future studies and discuss using replication proteins as novel antibiotic targets.",

    "abstract": "ginsenoside rg1 (rg1) has anti-aging and anti-neurodegenerative effects. however, the mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear. the aim of the present study was to determine whether rg1 affects hippocampal survival and neurite outgrowth in vitro after exposure to amyloid-beta peptide fragment 25-35 (a25-35), and to explore whether the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and akt signaling pathways are involved in these biological processes. we cultured hippocampal neurons from newborn rats for 24 hours, then added rg1 to the medium for another 24 hours, with or without pharmacological inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) family or akt signaling pathways for a further 24 hours. we then immunostained the neurons for growth associated protein-43, and measured neurite length. in a separate experiment, we exposed cultured hippocampal neurons to a25-35 for 30 minutes, before adding rg1 for 48 hours, with or without akt or mapk inhibitors, and assessed neuronal survival using hoechst 33258 staining, and phosphorylation of erk1/2 and akt by western blot analysis. rg1 induced neurite outgrowth, and this effect was blocked by api-2 (akt inhibitor) and pd98059 (mapk/erk kinase inhibitor), but not by sp600125 or sb203580 (inhibitors of c-jun n-terminal kinase and p38 mapk, respectively). consistent with this effect, rg1 upregulated the phosphorylation of akt and erk1/2; these effects were reversed by api-2 and pd98059, respectively. in addition, rg1 significantly reversed a25-35-induced apoptosis; this effect was blocked by api-2 and pd98059, but not by sp600125 or sb203580. finally, rg1 significantly reversed the a25-35-induced decrease in akt and erk1/2 phosphorylation, but api-2 prevented this reversal. our results indicate that rg1 enhances neurite outgrowth and protects against a25-35-induced damage, and that its mechanism may involve the activation of akt and erk1/2 signaling.",

    "abstract": "purpose epstein-barr virus associated gastric cancer (ebvagc) often exhibits a favorable prognosis that correlates with highly methylated viral and host genes and significant immune cell infiltration compared to ebv-negative gastric cancers (gcs). previously, it has been reported that expression of the il-15 receptor (il-15r) is down-regulated in ebvagc via promoter hypermethylation. in the present study, we offer a novel explanation for this puzzle by associating il-15r expression with infiltration of lymphocytes in gc lesions. methods we investigated the expression of il-15r by rt-pcr, western-blotting and immunohistochemistry in gc cell lines and primary tissues, respectively. il-15r promoter methylation was analyzed using genomic methylation sequencing. the growth behavior of gc cells was analyzed using mtt, flow cytometry, colony formation, transwell invasion and scratch wound healing assays. demethylation of il-15r was carried out using 5-aza-cdr, and ril-15 was added to evaluate growth promoting effects of the il-15/il-15r complex. human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were co-cultured with gc cells with/without the addition of ril-15, after which the phosphorylation of stat5 in pbmcs was evaluated using flow cytometry to estimate the activation of these immune cells through il-15 binding to il-2r/ receptors by in trans presentation. results we found that ebv-positive gc cells (ae) expressed il-15r at a significantly lower level than ebv-negative gc cells (ags) due to promoter hypermethylation. in the absence of immune cells, il-15r on the cancer cell surface induced a malignant phenotype, including augmented cell growth, migration and invasion, and decreased apoptosis. 5-aza-cdr reverted ae cells to a more malignant phenotype similar to ags cells, which may be attributed to activation of the stat1, stat3 and erk1/2 pathways. however, when pbmcs were added to the gc cell cultures, these immune cells were activated as detected by increased pstat5 levels. also, more gc cells underwent apoptosis. these effects were enhanced by the addition of ril-15 and, subsequently, confirmed in ebvagc patient samples exhibiting increased expression of t cell surface markers and activation of immune co-stimulating pathways. conclusions our findings suggest a mechanistic explanation for the clinical association of ebvagc with a lower il-15r expression, a better prognosis and an increased lymphocyte infiltration. we propose that in highly infiltrated gcs the il-15/il-15r complex on the gc cell surface may present il-15 in trans to il-2r/-expressing immune cells to activate these cells in the tumor microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "global change will disturb the frequency, scale and distribution of harmful algal blooms (habs), but we are unable to predict future habs due to our limited understanding of how physicochemical changes in the environment affect interspecific competition between dinoflagellates. trait-based mechanistic modelling is an important tool to unravel and quantify various direct and indirect interactions between species. the present study explores whether macarthur's consumer-resource model can be used as a viable base model to predict dinoflagellate growth in closed multispecies systems. to this end, two batch culture experiments (294 cultures in total) with monocultures and multispecies cultures of alexandrium minutum, prorocentrum lima, p. micans, protoceratium reticulatum and scrippsiella trochoidea were performed. despite changes to the relative (different nitrate concentrations) and absolute nutrient availability (dilutions of l1 medium), p. micans outcompeted all other species in mixed cultures. consumer-resource modelling parameterized using monoculture growth correctly predicted this species dominance (r between 0.80 and 0.95). parameter estimates revealed that p. micans had a faster uptake of nitrogen when compared to its competitors, but did not differ in resource efficiency and natural mortality rate. yet, while the model accurately predicted community dynamics during the growth phase, it was not able to predict their dynamics beyond the point of quiescence. consumer-resource modelling was shown to differentiate the roles of resource assimilation, resource efficiency, and natural mortality rates in batch culture experiments with minimal data requirements beyond common measurements. the results suggest that consumer-resource models provide a promising basis for trait-based modelling of interspecific competition between (harmful) algae.",

    "abstract": "the variation between the actual and perceived lightness of a stimulus has strong dependency on its background, a phenomena commonly known as lightness induction in the literature of visual neuroscience and psychology. for instance, a gray patch may perceptually appear to be darker in a background while it looks brighter when the background is reversed. in the literature it is further reported that such variation can take place in two possible ways. in case of stimulus like the simultaneous brightness contrast (sbc), the apparent lightness changes in the direction opposite to that of the background lightness, a phenomenon often referred to as lightness contrast, while in the others like neon colour spreading or checkerboard illusion it occurs opposite to that, and known as lightness assimilation. the white's illusion is a typical one which according to many, does not completely conform to any of these two processes. this paper presents the result of quantification of the perceptual strength of the white's illusion as a function of the width of the background square grating as well as the length of the gray patch. a linear filter model is further proposed to simulate the possible neurophysiological phenomena responsible for this particular visual experience. the model assumes that for the white's illusion, where the edges are strong and quite a few, i.e., the spectrum is rich in high frequency components, the inhibitory surround in the classical difference-of-gaussians (dog) filter gets suppressed, and the filter essentially reduces to an adaptive scale gaussian kernel that brings about lightness assimilation. the linear filter model with a gaussian kernel is used to simulate the white's illusion phenomena with wide variation of spatial frequency of the background grating as well as the length of the gray patch. the appropriateness of the model is presented through simulation results, which are highly tuned to the present as well as earlier psychometric results.",

    "abstract": "background the increased incidence of obesity and associated metabolic diseases has driven research focused on genetically or pharmacologically alleviating metabolic dysfunction. these studies employ a range of fasting-refeeding models including 4-24h fasts, \"overnight\" fasts, or meal feeding. still, we lack literature that describes the physiologically relevant adaptations that accompany changes in the duration of fasting and re-feeding. since the liver is central to whole body metabolic homeostasis, we investigated the timing of the fast-induced shift toward glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis and the meal-induced switch toward glycogenesis and away from ketogenesis. methods twelve to fourteen week old male c57bl/6j mice were fasted for 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16h and sacrificed 4h after lights on. in a second study, designed to understand the response to a meal, we gave fasted mice access to feed for 1 or 2h before sacrifice. we analyzed the data using mixed model analysis of variance. results fasting initiated robust metabolic shifts, evidenced by changes in serum glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (nefas), triacylglycerol, and -oh butyrate, as well as, liver triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acid, and glycogen content. glycogenolysis is the primary source to maintain serum glucose during the first 8h of fasting, while de novo gluconeogenesis is the primary source thereafter. the increase in serum -oh butyrate results from increased enzymatic capacity for fatty acid flux through -oxidation and shunting of acetyl-coa toward ketone body synthesis (increased cpt1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) and hmgcs2 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa synthase 2) expression, respectively). in opposition to the relatively slow metabolic adaptation to fasting, feeding of a meal results in rapid metabolic changes including full depression of serum -oh butyrate and nefas within an hour. conclusions herein, we provide a detailed description of timing of the metabolic adaptations in response to fasting and re-feeding to inform study design in experiments of metabolic homeostasis. since fasting and obesity are both characterized by elevated adipose tissue lipolysis, hepatic lipid accumulation, ketogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, understanding the drivers behind the metabolic shift from the fasted to the fed state may provide targets to limit aberrant gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in obesity.",

    "abstract": "wastewater irrigation is widely practiced and may cause serious environmental problems. however, current knowledge on the effects of long-term irrigation with wastewater from different sources on the biouptake of trace metals (tms) in the rhizosphere zone by plants in farmlands is limited. here, we analyzed wheat rhizosphere soil and wheat roots collected from a typical wastewater irrigation area in north china to evaluate the influence of wastewater irrigation from different sources on the bioavailability of trace metals in soils. results showed that irrigation with tanning and domestic wastewater helped enhance the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing the active organic carbon content, soil redox potential, and catalase activity, thus enhancing the proportion of the potentially bioavailable part of trace metal speciation. conversely, irrigation with pharmaceutical wastewater can reduce the bioavailability of trace metals in rhizosphere soil by increasing total soil antibiotics and thus decreasing the proportions of bioavailable and potentially bioavailable parts of trace metal speciation. these findings can provide insights into the migration and transformation of trace metal speciation in soil rhizosphere microenvironments under the context of wastewater irrigation.",

    "abstract": "we have developed the yeast pathway kit (ypk) for rational and random metabolic pathway assembly in saccharomyces cerevisiae using reusable and redistributable genetic elements. genetic elements are cloned in a suicide vector in a rapid process that omits pcr product purification. single-gene expression cassettes are assembled in vivo using genetic elements that are both promoters and terminators (tp). cassettes sharing genetic elements are assembled by recombination into multigene pathways. a wide selection of prefabricated tp elements makes assembly both rapid and inexpensive. an innovative software tool automatically produces detailed self-contained executable documentation in the form of pydna code in the narrative jupyter notebook format to facilitate planning and sharing ypk projects. a d-xylose catabolic pathway was created using ypk with four or eight genes that resulted in one of the highest growth rates reported on d-xylose (0.18 h(-1)) for recombinant s. cerevisiae without adaptation. the two-step assembly of single-gene expression cassettes into multigene pathways may improve the yield of correct pathways at the cost of adding overall complexity, which is offset by the supplied software tool.",

    "abstract": "microbiologically influenced corrosion (mic) is the terminology applied where the actions of microorganisms influence the corrosion process. in literature, terms such as microbial corrosion, biocorrosion, microbially influenced/induced corrosion, and biodegradation are often applied. mic research in the oil and gas industry has seen a revolution over the past decade, with the introduction of molecular microbiological methods: (mmm) as well as new industry standards and procedures of sampling biofilm and corrosion products from the process system. this review aims to capture the most important trends the oil and gas industry has seen regarding mic research over the past decade. the paper starts out with an overview of where in the process stream mic occurs - from the oil reservoir to the consumer. both biotic and abiotic corrosion mechanisms are explained in the context of managing mic using a structured corrosion management (cm) approach. the corrosion management approach employs the elements of a management system to ensure that essential corrosion control activities are carried out in an effective, sustainable, well-planned and properly executed manner. the 3-phase corrosion management approach covering of both biotic and abiotic internal corrosion mechanisms consists of 1) corrosion assessment, 2) corrosion mitigation and 3) corrosion monitoring. each of the three phases are described in detail with links to recent field cases, methods, industry standards and sampling protocols. in order to manage the corrosion threat, operators commonly use models to support decision making. the models use qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative measures to help assess the rate of degradation caused by mic. the paper reviews four existing models for mic threat assessment and describe a new model that links the threat of mic in the oil processing system located on an offshore platform with a risk based inspection (rbi) approach. a recent field case highlights and explains the conflicting historic results obtained through serial dilution of culture media using the most probable number (mpn) method as compared to data obtained from corrosion monitoring and the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) method. results from qpcr application in the field case have changed the way mic is monitored on the oil production facility in the north sea. a number of high quality resources have been published as technical conference papers, books, educational videos and peer-reviewed scientific papers, and thus we end the review with an updated list of state-of-the-art resources for anyone desiring to become more familiar with the topic of mic in the upstream oil and gas sector.",

    "abstract": "background the immune response of the critically ill after severe trauma is sex-specific and may explain the different progression of the disease. this may be explained by a different gene regulatory program of their peripheral immune cells. we investigated the progression of the transcription profiles of peripheral immune cells of the patients to elucidate their distinct physiological response and clinical course. methods we compared transcription profiles of whole blood of male and female patients from a larger longitudinal study of critically ill patients after trauma. we developed a statistical analysis pipeline that synchronized the time lapse of the profiles based on the temporal severity score of each patient. results this enabled to categorize the temporal progression of the disease into two pre-acute, an acute and two post-acute phases. comparing gene regulation of male and female patients at each phase, we identified distinctively regulated molecular processes mainly in the immune response, but also in the regulation of metabolism allowing to cluster these discriminative gene sets into sets of highly related cellular processes. compared to male patients and healthy controls, female patients showed upregulation of gene sets of innate immunity in the early phase, upregulation of wound healing processes during the acute phase and upregulation of adaptive immunity in the late phase indicating early recovery. in turn, during the pre-acute and acute phase, male patients showed less suppression of gene sets coding for enzymes of energy metabolism and anabolism, most prominently the tricarboxylic acid cycle and -oxidation, and cellular maintenance, such as cell cycle, dna replication and damage response, and rna metabolism. conclusions a stronger innate immune response at the very early phase of the disease may support early clearance of the pathogen and its associated molecular patterns. upregulation of wound healing processes may explain reduced multiple organ failure during the acute phase. down regulated energy metabolism during the acute phase may make female patients less susceptible to oxidative stress, the upregulated adaptive immune system reflects an earlier recovery and rebuilding of the adaptive immune system that may protect them from secondary infections. follow up studies need to be performed confirming these observations experimentally.",

    "abstract": "accumulated evidence suggests that m2-like polarized tumor associated macrophages (tams) plays an important role in cancer progression and metastasis, establishing tams, especially m2-like tams as an appealing target for therapy intervention. here we found that metformin significantly suppressed il-13 induced m2-like polarization of macrophages, as illustrated by reduced expression of cd206, down-regulation of m2 marker mrnas, and inhibition of m2-like macrophages promoted migration of cancer cells and endothelial cells. metformin triggered ampk1 activation in macrophage and silencing of ampk1 partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of metformin in il-13 induced m2-like polarization. administration of aicar, another activator of ampk, also blocked the m2-like polarization of macrophages. metformin greatly reduced the number of metastases of lewis lung cancer without affecting tumor growth. in tumor tissues, the percentage of m2-like macrophage was decreased and the area of pericyte-coated vessels was increased. further, the anti-metastatic effect of metformin was abolished when the animals were treated with macrophages eliminating agent clodronate liposome. these findings suggest that metformin is able to block the m2-like polarization of macrophages partially through ampk1, which plays an important role in metformin inhibited metastasis of lewis lung cancer.",

(n=12), canada (n=7), or european countries (n=10). study contexts included end of life (n=10), early treatment decisions (n=10), pain and symptom management (n=7), and patient-provider communication (n=6). the affective processes of patients (n=20), caregivers (n=16), and/or providers (n=12) were examined. results three features of the palliative care and advance care planning context may contribute to biased affective predictions: 1) early treatment decisions are made under heightened emotional states and with insufficient information; 2) palliative care decisions influence life domains beyond physical health; and 3) palliative care decisions involve multiple people. conclusion biases in affective predictions may serve as a barrier to optimal palliative care delivery. predictions are complicated by intense emotions, inadequate prognostic information, involvement of many individuals, and cancer's effect on non-health life domains. applying decision science frameworks may generate insights about affective predictions that can be harnessed to solve challenges associated with optimal delivery of palliative care.",

    "abstract": "background the recent newly appeared coronavirus disease (covid-19), caused by an enveloped rna virus named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2)\", is associated with severe respiratory morbidity and mortality. recent studies have shown that lymphopenia and a cytokine mass release represent important pathogenic features, with clinical evidence of dyspnea and hypoxemia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), in severely ill patients, with a high death toll. currently, stem cells are actively being investigated for their potential use in many \"untreatable\" diseases. in this regard and in particular, mesenchymal stem cells (msc), due to their intrinsic features, including either ability to impact on regulation of the immune system, or association with both anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties, or potential for differentiation into several cell lineages, have become a promising tool for cell and molecular-based therapies. on this background, we wished to explore whether human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hucms) would represent a potential viable therapeutic approach for the management of critically ill covid19 patients. methods we tested the hucms effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmcs) retrieved from patients with covid19 (ethical committee ceas umbria, italy cer n3658/20 7, may, 2020), both as free cell monolayers and after envelopment in sodium alginate microcapsules. both cell systems, after priming with ifn-, proved able to produce several immunomodulatory molecules such as ido1 and hlag5, although only the microencapsulated hucms were associated with massive and dose-dependent production of these factors. results the microencapsulated hucms improved allo-suppression in mixed lymphocytes reactions (mlrs), while also blunting t helper 1 and t helper 17 responses, that are involved with the cytokine storm and greatly contribute to the patient death. moreover, we observed that both free and microencapsulated hucms permitted 5 days survival of in vitro culture maintained pbmcs extracted from very ill patients. conclusion we have provided evidence that microencapsulated hucms in vitro, seem to represent a powerful tool to impact on several immune pathways, clearly deranged in covid19 patients. further study is necessary to begin in vivo assessment of this experimental system, upon determining both, the most appropriate time of the disease onset for intervention, and cell dosage/patient of our experimental product.",

    "abstract": "key points synchronized tms pulses with pre-defined brain oscillatory phases allows to evaluate the impact of brain states on tms effects. tms pulses over m1 at the negative peak of -frequency band induces higher phase-lock synchronization with interconnected contralateral homologous regions. cortico-cortical synchronization changes are linearly predicted by the fiber density and cross-section of the white matter tract that connect the two brain regions. phase-dependent tms delivery might be crucial not only to amplify local effects but also to increase magnitude and reliability of within-network synchronization. abstract recent studies have synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) application with pre-defined brain oscillatory phases showing how the effect of a perturbation depends on the brain state. however, none have investigated if phase-dependent tms can possibly modulate connectivity with homologous distant brain regions belonging to the same network. in the framework of network-targeted tms, we investigated whether stimulation delivered at a specific phase of ongoing brain oscillations might favor stronger cortico-cortical (c-c) synchronization of distant network nodes connected to the stimulation target. neuronavigated tms pulses were delivered over the primary motor cortex (m1) during ongoing electroencephalography recording in twenty-four healthy individuals over two repeated sessions 1-month apart. stimulation effects were analyzed considering whether the tms pulse was delivered at the time of a positive (peak) or negative (trough) phase of -frequency oscillation, which determines c-c synchrony within homologous areas of the sensorimotor network. diffusion weighted imaging was used to study c-c connectivity within the sensorimotor network and identify contralateral regions connected with the stimulation spot. depending on when during the -activity the tms-pulse was applied (peak or trough), its impact on inter-hemispheric network synchrony varied significantly. higher m1-m1 phase-lock synchronization with after the tms-pulse (0-200ms) in the -frequency band was found for trough compared to peak stimulation trials in both study visits. phase-dependent tms delivery might be crucial not only to amplify local effects but also to increase magnitude and the reliability of the response to the external perturbation, with implications for interventions aimed at engaging more distributed functional brain networks. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "pragmatic studies indicate that a substantial number of depressed patients do not remit with current first-line antidepressant treatments and after two failed treatment steps the chance of remission with subsequent therapies is around 15%. this paper focuses on current evidence for pharmacological treatments in resistant depression as well as possible future developments. for patients who have failed to respond to two antidepressant trials, augmentation with atypical antipsychotic drugs, specifically quetiapine and aripiprazole, has the best evidence for efficacy, though older treatments such as lithium and triiodothyronine still have utility. the striking antidepressant effect of ketamine in resistant depression has stimulated research into glutamatergic compounds; however, capturing the efficacy of ketamine with drugs suitable for continuous use has proved challenging. growing knowledge of the pathophysiological role of inflammation in depression offers great opportunities for future treatment in terms of repurposing anti-inflammatory agents from general medicine and pre-treatment stratification of those depressed patients in whom such interventions are likely to be beneficial. finally an older drug, the dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole, if used carefully may well improve the prospects of depressed patients who are refractory to current approaches.",

    "abstract": "energy harvesting is currently a hot research topic, mainly as a consequence of the increasing attractiveness of computing and sensing solutions based on small, low-power distributed embedded systems. harvesting may enable systems to operate in a deploy-and-forget mode, particularly when power grid is absent and the use of rechargeable batteries is unattractive due to their limited lifetime and maintenance requirements. this paper focuses on wind flow as an energy source feasible to meet the energy needs of a small autonomous embedded system. in particular the contribution is on the electrical converter and system integration. we characterize the micro-wind turbine, we define a detailed model of its behaviour, and then we focused on a highly efficient circuit to convert wind energy into electrical energy. the optimized design features an overall volume smaller than 64 cm. the core of the harvester is a high efficiency buck-boost converter which performs an optimal power point tracking. experimental results show that the wind generator boosts efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "background laryngeal microsurgery (lms) is often accompanied by a sudden increase in blood pressure (bp) during surgery because of stimulation around the larynx. this sudden change in the hemodynamic status is not immediately reflected in a casual cuff-type measurement that takes intermittent readings every 3 to 5 min. objective this study aimed to investigate the potential of pulse arrival time (pat) as a marker for a bp surge, which usually occurs in patients undergoing lms. methods intermittent measurements of bp and electrocardiogram (ecg) and photoplethysmogram (ppg) signals were recorded during lms. pat was defined as the interval between the r-peak on the ecg and the maximum slope on the ppg. mean pat values before and after bp increase were compared. ppg-related parameters and the correlations between changes in these variables were calculated. results bp surged because of laryngoscopic manipulation (mean systolic bp [sbp] from 115.3, sd 21.4 mmhg, to 159.9, sd 25.2 mmhg; p<.001), whereas pat decreased significantly (from mean 460.6, sd 51.9 ms, to 405.8, sd 50.1 ms; p<.001) in most of the cases. the change in sbp showed a significant correlation with the inverse of the pat (r=0.582; p<.001). receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that an increase of 11.5% in the inverse of the pat could detect a 40% increase in sbp, and the area under the curve was 0.814. conclusions during lms, where invasive arterial catheterization is not always possible, pat shows good correlation with sbp and may, therefore, have the potential to identify abrupt bp surges during laryngoscopic manipulations in a noninvasive manner.",

    "abstract": "the free flap failure rate is less than 5%. the responsible mechanisms of postoperative secondary ischemia are mostly vascular. the main postoperative complication leading to flap failure is thrombosis. different strategies have been reported to improve the reliability of flaps and decrease the risk of partial or total necrosis: thus, pharmacologic agents have been studied to reduce the risk of microvascular thrombosis. the aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of calcium channel blockers and prostaglandins on free skin flap survival. a systematic review of the literature was performed to identify articles studying the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and prostaglandins on free flap survival. after full text reading, eleven articles were finally included. eight articles investigated the role of prostaglandins in free tissue transfers, two in rats subjects, one in rabbits, five in humans. two articles studied the effect of calcium channel blockers on free flaps, one in rats subjects, one in rabbits. one article studied in different groups the effect of calcium channel blockers and prostaglandins on free flaps in rabbits. literature regarding the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and prostaglandins to salvage free flap is poor and mainly based on animal models. nevertheless, studies on prostaglandins showed a slight efficiency of these molecules for free flap salvage. results are less reliable for calcium channel blockers and dependent on the molecule used. in conclusion, there is a lack of evidence to use them in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "background apigenin can reduce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by downregulating hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (hif-1) expression. however, its effects on cardiac fibroblasts (cfs) and its exact inhibitory molecular mechanisms on hif-1 remain unclear. purpose this study aims to examine the effects of apigenin on cell proliferation and differentiation, microrna-122-5p (mir-122-5p) expression, and hif-1-mediated smad signaling pathway in transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-1)-stimulated cfs and cardiac fibrosis and to investigate the relationship between mir-122-5p and hif-1. methods the tgf-1-stimulated cfs, the combination of tgf-1-stimulated and mir-122-5p mimic-transfected cfs, the combination of tgf-1-stimulated and mir-122-5p inhibitor-transfected cfs, and the isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrotic mice were used and treated with or without apigenin. the recombinant lentiviruses overexpressing hif-1 vector and mir-122-5p mimic were co-transfected to observe their interaction. related mrna and protein expressions and myocardial collagen were determined. the luciferase reporter gene that contains hif-1 wild type or mutant type 3'-utr was used, and the luciferase activity was determined to verify the direct link between mir-122-5p and hif-1. results in the tgf-1-stimulated cfs, apigenin treatment increased the mir-122-5p and smad7 expressions and decreased the hif-1, -smooth muscle actin, collagen /, smad2/3, and p-smad2/3 expressions. similar and inverse results were observed in the mir-122-5p mimic- and inhibitor-transfected cfs, respectively. moreover, the mir-122-5p mimic could antagonize the effects of tgf-1 in the tgf-1 and mir-122-5p mimic-combined cfs, and the mir-122-5p inhibitor could enhance the effects of tgf-1 in the tgf-1 and mir-122-5p inhibitor-combined cfs. in the two aforementioned cell models, the addition of apigenin could further enhance the effects of mir-122-5p mimic and partially reverse the effects of mir-122-5p inhibitor. after treatment of hif-1-transfected cfs with mir-122-5p mimic, the hif-1 expression decreased. further study confirmed that hif-1 was a direct target of mir-122-5p. apigenin also decreased the myocardial collagen accumulation in cardiac fibrotic mice. conclusion apigenin could suppress the differentiation and collagen synthesis of tgf-1-stimulated cfs and mouse cardiac fibrosis, and its mechanisms were related to the increment of mir-122-5p expression and subsequent downregulation of hif-1 expression via direct interaction, which might finally result in the decrements of smad2/3 and p-smad2/3 expressions and increment of smad7 expression.",

    "abstract": "this paper reports the development of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (uhplcms/ms) method to determine eight banned dyes (sudan i-iv, sudan orange, sudan red 7b, para red, rhodamine b) in turmeric, curry, and chili products. for this purpose, the feasibility of electrospray (esi), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (apci) and atmospheric pressure photoionization (appi) for the ionization of these compounds was evaluated. the tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) fragmentation of all targeted compounds was studied and both multistage mass spectrometry and high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to establish the fragmentation pathways and identify common fragmentation behaviors. among the most significant ions, the most characteristic and abundant product ions observed on the triple quadrupole were selected to propose a selective and sensitive uhplcms/ms method (multiple reaction monitoring mode, mrm) of these target compounds in spices samples after a quick and easy extraction with acetonitrile. matrix effect (me) studies carried out in the three atmospheric pressure ionization sources have demonstrated that apci showed the best performance with me values ranging from 2 to 25%. furthermore, the estimated quality parameters indicated the good performance of the proposed method, providing low method limits of detection (mlods) (1-48gkg-1), good intra-day precision (rsd %<15%), and accurate quantitation (relative error %<15%). finally, the applicability of the developed method was demonstrated by the analysis of turmeric, curry, and chili products. in total, 36 diverse samples coming from different countries were analyzed and although none of these compounds were detected above the mlods, the analysis of spiked samples showed that the method was able to detect this family of compounds at low g kg-1.",

    "abstract": "atrophy is a classical hallmark of an array of disorders that affect skeletal muscle, ranging from inherited dystrophies, acquired inflammatory myopathies, ageing (sarcopenia) and critical illness (sepsis). the loss of muscle mass and function in these instances is associated with disability, poor quality of life and in some cases mortality. the mechanisms which underpin muscle atrophy are complex; however, significant research has demonstrated an important role for inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-), mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) in muscle wasting. moreover, activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b (nf-b) is a key lynchpin in the overall processes that mediate muscle atrophy. the significance of nf-b as a key regulator of muscle atrophy has been emphasised by several in vivo studies, which have demonstrated that nf-b-targeted therapies can abrogate muscle atrophy. in this chapter, we will summarise current knowledge on the role of cytokines (tnf-) and nf-b in the loss of muscle mass and function and highlight perspectives towards future research and potential therapies to combat muscle atrophy.",

    "abstract": "plants regulate a number of primary metabolites, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids, in response to uv-b radiation. therefore, it is essential to understand the time-dependent response of rice plants to uv-b stress. this study focused on the response of plants to uv-b at different leaf developmental phases (emerging, growing, and maturing) in an attempt to fully comprehend the metabolic shift. we analyzed the expression levels of genes related to starch/sucrose metabolism in the leaf blades of rice seedlings (oryza sativa l. \"saechuchenog\") exposed to uv-b irradiation for short (1day) and long terms (5days) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. we also examined the diurnal variations in the contents of primary metabolites using an established gctof-ms (gas chromatography time of flight-mass spectrometry) method. the results showed that the levels of primary metabolites were largely dependent upon the diurnal rhythm and leaf developmental phase. the young leaves (sink) produced and accumulated starch rather than sucrose. the short-term (4h, 1day) uv-b exposure inhibited sucrose synthesis, which could be the first target of uv-b radiation. following short- and long-term (5days) exposure to uv-b radiation, the dynamic response of primary metabolites was evaluated. it was found that the content of carbohydrates decreased throughout the period of exposure to uv-b stress, especially in terms of sucrose concentration. however, the content of the majority of amino acids increased after an early decrease. our data revealed that the metabolic response, as well as the gene expression, differed with the period (intensity) of exposure to uv-b radiation and with the phase of leaf development. these findings provide new insights for a better understanding of the metabolic response of a variety of plant species exposed to a wide range of uv-b radiation.",

    "abstract": "this paper proposes a data-based approach for a robust fault detection (fd) of the inertial measurement unit (imu) sensors of an aircraft. fuzzy interval models (fims) have been introduced for coping with the significant modeling uncertainties caused by poorly modeled aerodynamics. the proposed fims are used to compute robust prediction intervals for the measurements provided by the imu sensors. specifically, a nonlinear neural network (nn) model is used as central prediction of the sensor response while the uncertainty around the central estimation is captured by the fim model. the uncertainty has been also modelled using a conventional linear interval model (im) approach; this allows a quantitative evaluation of the benefits provided by the fim approach. the identification of the ims and of the fims was formalized as a linear matrix inequality (lmi) optimization problem using as cost function the (mean) amplitude of the prediction interval and as optimization variables the parameters defining the amplitudes of the intervals of the ims and fims. based on the identified models, fd validation tests have been successfully conducted using actual flight data of a p92 tecnam aircraft by artificially injecting additive fault signals on the fault free imu readings.",

    "abstract": "diatoms are one of the most productive and successful photosynthetic taxa on earth and possess attributes such as rapid growth rates and production of lipids, making them candidate sources of renewable fuels. despite their significance, few details of the mechanisms used to regulate growth and carbon metabolism are currently known, hindering metabolic engineering approaches to enhance productivity. to characterize the transcript level component of metabolic regulation, genome-wide changes in transcript abundance were documented in the model diatom thalassiosira pseudonana on a time-course of silicon starvation. growth, cell cycle progression, chloroplast replication, fatty acid composition, pigmentation, and photosynthetic parameters were characterized alongside lipid accumulation. extensive coordination of large suites of genes was observed, highlighting the existence of clusters of coregulated genes as a key feature of global gene regulation in t. pseudonana. the identity of key enzymes for carbon metabolic pathway inputs (photosynthesis) and outputs (growth and storage) reveals these clusters are organized to synchronize these processes. coordinated transcript level responses to silicon starvation are probably driven by signals linked to cell cycle progression and shifts in photophysiology. a mechanistic understanding of how this is accomplished will aid efforts to engineer metabolism for development of algal-derived biofuels.",

    "abstract": "blood coagulation is a critical hemostatic process that must be properly regulated to maintain a delicate balance between bleeding and clotting. disorders of blood coagulation can expose patients to the risk of either bleeding disorders or thrombotic diseases. coagulation diagnostics using whole blood is very promising for assessing the complexity of the coagulation system and for global measurements of hemostasis. despite the clinic values that existing whole blood coagulation tests have demonstrated, these systems have significant limitations that diminish their potential for point-of-care applications. here, recent advancements in device miniaturization using functional soft materials are leveraged to develop a miniaturized clot retraction force assay device termed mhemoretractometer (mhrm). the mhrm is capable of precise measurements of dynamic clot retraction forces in real time using minute amounts of whole blood. to further demonstrate the clinical utility of the mhrm, systematic studies are conducted using the mhrm to examine the effects of assay temperature, treatments of clotting agents, and pro- and anti-coagulant drugs on clot retraction force developments of whole blood samples. the mhrm's low fabrication cost, small size, and consumption of only minute amounts of blood samples make the technology promising as a point-of-care tool for future coagulation monitoring.",

    "abstract": "a field-based investigation was conducted at a contaminated site where the vadose zone was contaminated with a range of chlorinated hydrocarbons. the investigation consisted of groundwater and multilevel soil-gas monitoring of a range of contaminants and gases, along with isotope measurements and microbiology studies. the investigation provided multiple lines of evidence that demonstrated aerobic biodegradation of vinyl chloride (vc) was occurring in the vadose zone (i) above the on-site source zone, and (ii) above the downgradient off-site groundwater plume location. data from both the on-site and off-site locations were consistent in showing substantially greater (an order of magnitude greater) rates of vc removal from the aerobic vadose zone compared to more recalcitrant contaminants trichloroethene (tce) and tetrachloroethene (pce). soil gas vc isotope analysis showed substantial isotopic enrichment of vc (c -5.2 to -10.9) compared to groundwater (c -39.5) at the on-site location. soil gas co isotope analysis at both locations showed that co was highly isotopically depleted (c -28.8 to -33.3), compared to soil gas co data originating from natural sediment organic matter (c= -14.7 to -21.3). the soil gas co2 c values were consistent with near-water table vc groundwater c values (-36.8 to -39.5), suggesting co originating from aerobic biodegradation of vc. bacteria that had functional genes (ethene monooxygenase (etnc) and epoxyalkane transferase (etne)) involved in ethene metabolism and vc oxidation were more abundant at the source zone where oxygen co-existed with vc. the distribution of vc and oxygen vadose zone vapour plumes, together with long-term changes in soil gas co concentrations and temperature, provided information to elucidate the factors controlling aerobic biodegradation of vc in the vadose zone. based on the overlapping vc and oxygen vadose zone vapour plumes, aerobic vapour biodegradation rates were independent of substrate (vc and/or oxygen) concentration. the high correlation (r=0.962 to 0.975) between co concentrations and temperature suggested that aerobic biodegradation of vc was controlled by bacterial activity that was regulated by the temperature within the vadose zone. when assessing a contaminated site for possible vapour intrusion into buildings, accounting for environmental conditions for aerobic biodegradation of vc in the vadose zone should improve the assessment of environmental risk of vc intrusion into buildings, enabling better identification and prioritisation of contaminated sites to be remediated.",

    "abstract": "objective current management of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries is variable with operative decisions based on assumptions that irreversible degeneration of the human motor endplate (mep) follows prolonged denervation and precludes reinnervation. however, the mechanism and time course of mep changes after human peripheral nerve injury have not been investigated. consequently, there are no objective measures by which to determine the probability of spontaneous recovery and the optimal timing of surgical intervention. to improve guidance for such decisions, the aim of this study was to characterize morphological changes at the human mep following traumatic nerve injury. methods a prospective cohort (here analyzed retrospectively) of 18 patients with traumatic brachial plexus and axillary nerve injuries underwent biopsy of denervated muscles from the upper extremity from 3 days to 6 years after injury. muscle specimens were processed for h & e staining and immunohistochemistry, with visualization via confocal and two-photon excitation microscopy. results immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated varying degrees of fragmentation and acetylcholine receptor dispersion in denervated muscles. comparison of denervated muscles at different times postinjury revealed progressively increasing degeneration. linear regression analysis of 3d reconstructions revealed significant linear decreases in mep volume (r = -0.92, r2 = 0.85, p = 0.001) and surface area (r = -0.75, r2 = 0.56, p = 0.032) as deltoid muscle denervation time increased. surprisingly, innervated and structurally intact meps persisted in denervated muscle specimens from multiple patients 6 or more months after nerve injury, including 2 patients who had presented > 3 years after nerve injury. conclusions this study details novel and critically important data about the morphology and temporal sequence of events involved in human mep degradation after traumatic nerve injuries. surprisingly, human meps not only persisted, but also retained their structures beyond the assumed 6-month window for therapeutic surgical intervention based on previous clinical studies. preoperative muscle biopsy in patients being considered for nerve transfer may be a useful prognostic tool to determine mep viability in denervated muscle, with surviving meps also being targets for adjuvant therapy.",

    "abstract": "objective the ketogenic diet is clinically used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy. the diet treatment markedly increases ketone bodies (acetoacetate and -hydroxybutyrate), which work as energy metabolites in the brain. here, we investigated effects of acetoacetate on voltage-dependent ca2+ channels (vdccs) in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. we further explored an acetoacetate analog that inhibited vdccs in pyramidal cells, reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs), and suppressed seizures in vivo. methods the effects of acetoacetate and its analogs on vdccs and epscs were evaluated using patch-clamp recordings from ca1 pyramidal cells of mouse hippocampal slices. the in vivo effects of these reagents were also evaluated using a chronic seizure model induced by intrahippocampal injection of kainate. results acetoacetate inhibited vdccs in pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices, and reduced epscs in slices exhibiting epileptiform activity. more potent epsc inhibitors were then explored by modifying the chemical structure of acetoacetate, and 2-phenylbutyrate was identified as an acetoacetate analog that inhibited vdccs and epscs more potently. although acetoacetate is known to inhibit vesicular glutamate transporters (vgluts), 2-phenylbutyrate did not inhibit vgluts, showing that 2-phenylbutyrate is an acetoacetate analog that preferably inhibits vdccs. in addition, 2-phenylbutyrate markedly reduced epscs in slices exhibiting epileptiform activity, and suppressed hippocampal seizures in vivo in a mouse model of epilepsy. the in vivo antiseizure effects of 2-phenylbutyrate were more potent than those of acetoacetate. finally, intraperitoneal 2-phenylbutyrate was delivered to the brain, and its brain concentration reached the level enough to reduce epscs. significance these results demonstrate that 2-phenylbutyrate is an acetoacetate analog that inhibits vdccs and epscs in pyramidal cells, suppresses hippocampal seizures in vivo, and has brain penetration ability. thus 2-phenylbutyrate provides a useful chemical structure as a lead compound to develop new antiseizure drugs originating from ketone bodies.",

    "abstract": "objective independent living ability is crucial for the elderly; however, its assessment performed in china employs various scales and lacks risk factors, especially behavioural and social-psychological factors, which could be improved through health education. this study aimed to assess the independent living ability of community-dwelling elderly in urban areas of china and to identify the association with behavioral and social-psychological factors. design a population-based study using random cluster sampling method was performed in two core cities in liaoning province during march-november 2012. study population 3686 individuals who were >=65 years old, had no dementia and cognitive impairment, had lived in the sampled communities for >=5 years and could take part in the study were enrolled. main outcome measures interviews were conducted to collect information of independent living ability, indicated by the instrumental activity of daily living (iadl), behavioural factors, social-psychological factors and confounders (demographic characteristics and health status). the mini-mental state examination was used to screen for cognitive impairment. results the independence rate was 46.3% in men and 41.1% in women. structural equation modelling analysis showed that physical activity, drawn from taking a walk and doing exercise, had the strongest association with the iadl in both men (-0.34, se 0.10) and women (-0.33, se 0.11). falling in the last year and worrying about falling were also significantly associated with iadl. the effects of regular drinking, feeling lonely and participating in entertainment were significant in men. conclusion the independent living ability of the elderly in urban areas in liaoning province in china was at a low level. physical activity was one of the important roles in both men and women; whereas the role of social-psychological factors only existed in men. gender-specific healthcare and education to avoid sedentary life should be advocated for the elderly to maintain/improve their independent living ability.",

    "abstract": "chlorophenols comprise of a large group of chemicals used inter alia for the production of biocides, pharmaceuticals, other industrial products and are used e.g. as antiseptics or wood preservatives due to their biocidal properties. several of them are classified as toxic to aquatic life and harmful to humans by ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact, causing skin and eye irritation. moreover, chlorophenols are possibly carcinogenic to humans. the most prominent chlorophenol - pentachlorophenol - is carcinogenic to humans, was banned in germany in 1989 and further regulated by the european commission in 2006 and included in the stockholm convention in 2017. some chlorophenols are persistent in the environment and are also biodegradation products of precursor substances. to evaluate the health-relevance of recent exposure and monitor the effectiveness of regulatory measures, chlorophenols were analysed in the population-representative german environmental survey on children and adolescents 2014-2017 (geres v). first-morning void urine samples of 485 3-17-year-old children and adolescents were analysed for ten chlorophenols. pentachlorophenol was still quantified in 87% of the children and adolescents with a geometric mean (gm) concentration of 0.19g/l (0.16 g/gcrea) and a maximum concentration of 6.7g/l (5.4 g/gcrea). the maximum concentration was well below the health-based guidance value hbm-i of 25g/l (20 g/gcrea). 4-monochlorophenol was quantified in all samples with a gm concentration of 1.38g/l (1.14 g/gcrea). 2-monochlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 2,5-dichlorophenol were quantified in 97%, 98%, and 95% of the samples, with gms of 0.26g/l (0.21 g/gcrea), 0.24g/l (0.20 g/gcrea), and 0.26g/l (0.21 g/gcrea). 2,6-dichlorophenol, 2,3,4-trichlorophenol, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol were quantified in 17-25% of the samples with gms below the limit of quantification (loq) of 0.1g/l 2,4,6-trichlorophenol was quantified in 72% of the samples (gm: 0.13g/l, 0.11 g/gcrea), 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol in 44% of the samples (gm<loq). comparison to previous cycles of geres revealed substantially lower exposure to most of the chlorophenols in geres v. exposure levels found in germany were comparatively low in contrast to north american results.",

    "abstract": "purpose over the last four decades, ocular proton therapy has been successfully used to treat patients affected by intraocular lesions. for this, treatment geometry verification is routinely performed using radiographic images to align a configuration of fiducial radiopaque markers implanted on the sclera outer surface. this paper describes the clinical application of an alternative approach based on optical eye tracking for three-dimensional noninvasive and automatic eye localization. an experimental protocol was designed to validate the optical-based eye referencing against both radiographic imaging system and the clinically used eyeplan treatment planning system. methods the eye tracking system (ets) was installed in the optis 2 treatment room at psi to acquire eye motions during the treatment of nine patients. the pupil position and the cornea curvature center were localized by segmenting the pupil contour and corneal light reflections on the images acquired by a pair of calibrated optical cameras. after calibration of the ets, a direct comparison of radiopaque markers position, and consequentially eye position and orientation, provided by the ets, radiographs and eyeplan was performed. results nineteen out of thirty total monitored fractions were excluded from the study due to poor visibility of corneal reflection, resulting in a success rate of acquisition of 37%. for these data, overall median agreement between ets-based and x-ray-based markers position assessment were 0.29mm and 0.94 for translations and rotations, respectively. small discrepancies were also measured in the eye center estimates of the ets and eyeplan. conversely, variations in measured eye orientation were higher, with interquartile range (iqr) between 4.39 and 7.58. nonetheless, dosimetric evaluation of the consequence of ets uncertainties showed that the target volume would still be covered by more than 95% of the dose in all cases. conclusion an ets was successfully installed in a clinical ocular proton therapy treatment room and used to monitor eye position and orientation in a clinical scenario. first results show the potential of such a system as an eye localization device. however, the low success rate prevents straightforward clinical application and needs further improvements aimed at increasing corneal reflection visibility.",

    "abstract": "osteoporosis is a widespread musculoskeletal deformity that affects thousands of older people every year, leading to bone abnormalities and ultimately increasing the risk of bone fractures in both genders. it is considered a lethal disease causing death in thousands of people at the late stage of life. dendropanax morbifera leveille is a subtropical broad-leaved prevalent species in korea. extracts of the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of d. morbifera have been used in traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous diseases such as diabetes, atherogenesis, skin disorders, and headaches. however, the anti-osteoporosis effects of d. morbifera have not been examined. the primary objectives of this study were to elucidate the anti-osteoporosis effect of d. morbifera extract through an in vitro study using pre-osteoblastic mc3t3-e1 cells. we found that d. morbifera strongly increased the expression of bone metabolic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity, type i collagen (col-i) level, and mineralization. additionally, d. morbifera extract also upregulated the mrna expression levels of osteogenic genes including alp, osteocalcin (ocn), osterix (osx), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx2) in mc3t3-e1 cells via upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (bmp-2)/p38 mapk/jnk and smad1/5/8 signaling pathways. moreover, addition of d. morbifera significantly suppressed the inhibitory effect of sb203580 (p38 inhibitor). in conclusion, the current study demonstrated that d. morbifera extract significantly increased osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in mc3t3-e1 cells by regulating bmp-2/p38/jnk and smad1/5/8. our study might be helpful in the discovery and development of new anti-osteoporosis therapeutic agents.",

    "title": "bioinformatics analysis of top-down mass spectrometry data with prosight lite.",
    "abstract": "traditional bottom-up mass spectrometry-based proteomics relies on the use of an enzyme, often trypsin, to generate small peptides (typically < 25 amino acids long). in top-down proteomics, proteins remain intact and are directly measured within the mass spectrometer. this technique, while inherently simpler than bottom-up proteomics, generates data which must be processed and analyzed using software tools \"purpose-built\" for the job. in this chapter, we will show the analysis of intact protein spectra through deconvolution, deisotoping, and searching with prosight lite, a free, vendor-agnostic tool for the analysis of top-down mass spectrometry data. we will illustrate with two examples of intact protein fragmentation spectra and discuss the iterative use of the software to characterize proteoforms and discover the sites of post-translational modifications.",
