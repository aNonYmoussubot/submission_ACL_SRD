    "abstract": "introduction burnout syndrome has been characterized as a process of chronic responses to occupational stress in certain employee groups. however, this phenomenon has also been reported in other participant groups including university students. the maslach burnout inventory-student survey (mbi-ss), composed of the exhaustion, cynicism and efficacy subscales, was used to evaluate burnout in this sample group while the utrecht work engagement scale (uwes) was used to gather data related to engagement, a positive psychology construct composed of the three factors, namely vigor, dedication, and absorption. to date, no studies considered these factors in relation to occupational therapy students. this begs the question, is there a relationship between occupational therapy students' self-reported levels of burnout and engagement? objectives the study objectives are to (1) ascertain the self-reported levels of burnout and engagement in a sample of australian occupational undergraduate therapy students, and (2) analyze the sociodemographic, occupational and academic characteristic associated with these levels. methods participants were 225 australian undergraduate occupational therapy students from monash university completed the mbi-ss and the uwes for students. descriptive, bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. results regarding mbi-ss burnout dimensions, exhaustion was associated with age, year level of enrolment and hours of direct time spent working on occupational therapy studies, explaining 15% of its variance. cynicism and efficacy were associated with age, year level of enrolment and hours of indirect time, accounting for 16% of its variance. for the uwes engagement dimensions, year level of enrolment and hours of indirect time spent working on occupational therapy studies were significant predictors of vigor, explaining 27% its variance while while age, gender, year level of enrolment, hours of indirect time spent working on occupational therapy studies, and hours spend per week engaged in self-care activities accounted for 23% of the variance of dedication. finally, age, year level of enrolment, and hours of indirect time spent working on occupational therapy studies explained 27% of the variance of absorption. conclusion the results indicate that a number of demographic and academic study variables are significantly associated with burnout syndrome and education engagement reported by undergraduate occupational therapy students.",

    "abstract": "objective most of the existing studies investigating the impact of schizophrenia on utility have focused on the different stages of the disease. the objective of this study was to describe and quantify the impact of treatment-related side-effects on utility in patients with schizophrenia, using data from an observational study. methods this study used data from the european schizophrenia cohort (eurosc), a multi-center 2-year cohort study conducted in france, england, and germany. the eq-5d questionnaire was completed every 6 months, as well as the subjective side effect rating scale, assessing patient distress over extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction, used to assess whether or not the patient experienced the side-effect. at first a bivariate analysis was conducted to describe utility values with and without side-effects. then, a random effects regression analysis was performed on utility, where random effects were controlled for repeated measures on the same subjects, with potential confounding factors. finally, findings were compared with those of previous publications. results this sample consisted of 1208 patients with schizophrenia. at the baseline visit, the most reported side-effect was eps (almost 60% of patients), followed by sedation and weight gain (50% of patients for each), and sexual dysfunction (almost 30% of patients). significant association with severity of symptoms, functioning abilities, and utility were found. patients reporting none of the studied side-effects had an average eq-5d index score of 0.81, found to be higher than scores of patients reporting eps (0.70), sexual dysfunction (0.67), sedation (0.70), or weight gain (0.72). the random effects model reported a utility decrement of 0.042 for eps, 0.022 for weight gain, 0.022 for sexual dysfunction, and 0.019 for sedation. although the external validation was difficult due to the different methods or definitions of the side-effects, as well as the paucity of data for weight gain, sedation and sexual dysfunction, the results were generally consistent with previous studies. conclusion this study aimed at quantifying the direct impact of main side-effects associated with antipsychotics on patients' utility. results suggested a significant direct impact of side-effects, with eps being the most impactful.",

    "abstract": "an influential framework suggests that the central nucleus of the amygdala (cea) is involved in phasic responses to threat, while the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bnst) mediates sustained anxiety. however, this model has been questioned, proposing that the role of the bnst is not limited to sustained threat contexts. rather, amygdala and bnst also seem to work in concert in the processing of discrete and briefly presented threat-related stimuli, likely dependent on inter-individual differences in anxiety. a direct test of this assumption with sufficient experimental power is missing in human research and the degree to which individual differences in trait anxiety moderate phasic responses and functional connectivity of amygdala and bnst during threat processing remains unclear. the current event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) study investigated activation and connectivity of amygdala and bnst, as well as modulating effects of trait anxiety, during processing of briefly presented threat-related relative to neutral standardized pictures in 93 psychiatrically healthy individuals. both amygdala and bnst activation was increased during presentation of threat-related relative to neutral pictures. furthermore, functional connectivity between bnst and amygdala in response to threat was positively associated with trait anxiety. these findings suggest that amygdala and bnst form a functional unit during phasic threat processing whereby their connectivity is shaped by inter-individual differences in trait anxiety.",

    "abstract": "metacognitive evaluations refer to the processes by which people assess their own cognitive operations with respect to their current goal. little is known about whether this process is susceptible to social influence. here we investigate whether nonverbal social signals spontaneously influence metacognitive evaluations. participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task, which was followed by a face randomly gazing towards or away from the response chosen by the participant. participants then provided a metacognitive evaluation of their response by rating their confidence in their answer. in experiment 1, the participants were told that the gaze direction was irrelevant to the task purpose and were advised to ignore it. the results revealed an effect of implicit social information on confidence ratings even though the gaze direction was random and therefore unreliable for task purposes. in addition, nonsocial cues (car) did not elicit this effect. in experiment 2, the participants were led to believe that cue direction (face or car) reflected a previous participant's response to the same question-that is, the social information provided by the cue was made explicit, yet still objectively unreliable for the task. the results showed a similar social influence on confidence ratings, observed with both cues (car and face) but with an increased magnitude relative to experiment 1. we additionally showed in experiment 2 that social information impaired metacognitive accuracy. together our results strongly suggest an involuntary susceptibility of metacognitive evaluations to nonverbal social information, even when it is implicit (experiment 1) and unreliable (experiments 1 and 2).",

    "abstract": "improving the healing capacity of asphalt is proving to be an effective method to prolong the service life of an asphalt pavement. the calcium alginate capsules encapsulating rejuvenator have been developed and proved to provide successful localized crack healing in asphalt mastic. however, it is not known whether this self-healing asphalt system will improve healing capacity of a full asphalt mix. to this aim, this paper reports on study which investigate effect of the calcium alginate capsules onto self-healing capacity of the porous asphalt mix. x-ray computed tomography (xct) was used to visualize the distribution of the capsules in porous asphalt. the effect of the capsules on fracture resistance of porous asphalt concrete was studied by semi-circular bending (scb) tests. a semi-circular bending and healing programme was carried out to evaluate the healing effect of these capsules in porous asphalt concrete. indirect tensile stiffness modulus (itsm) tests were employed in order to investigate the influence of the capsules on the stiffness of the porous asphalt concrete. the results indicate that incorporating calcium alginate capsules significantly improve the healing capacity of porous asphalt concrete without compromising its performance.",

    "abstract": "background: tac2-n (tc2n) is a tandem c2 domain-containing protein, acting as a novel oncogene or suppressor in different kinds of cancers. however, the status of tc2n expression and its significance in gastric cancer (gc) is still unclear. the present study is aimed to elucidate the clinicopathological significance and prognostic value of tc2n level in gc. methods: we used sequencing data from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) database to analyze tc2n expression in gc by ualcan database and gene expression profiling interactive analysis tools (gepia). tc2n expression level in 12 pairs of fresh gc tissues and adjacent nontumorous tissues was detected by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and western blot (wb) assays. immunohistochemical (ihc) staining was used to detect tc2n protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues in our center. in vitro proliferation, migration and invasion assays were used to evaluate the effect of tc2n on functional capability of gastric cancer cells. linkedomics was used to identify gene expressions associated with tc2n. results: the mrna and protein expression of tc2n in gastric cancer were both significantly higher than normal gastric mucosa. it was also elevated in gastric cancer cells compared with normal gastric epithelium cell. in vitro assays suggested that tc2n facilitated proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. bioinformatic analysis showed a widespread impact of tc2n on the transcriptome and a strong interaction with tumor associated genes. we also found that tc2n was an independent prognostic factor for long-term survival in gc patients and its high expression was evidently associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. conclusions: our results show that high level of tc2n correlates with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer and promotes the development of gastric cancer. thus, tc2n expression can serve as a prognostic biomarker for patients with gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "background and objective the biochemical effects of an over-the-counter (otc) medication were studied, which consists of a single-tuft brush containing cetylpyridinium chloride as a bactericidal agent, dipotassium glycyrrhizate as an anti-inflammatory drug and allantoin as a promoter of cell proliferation and wound healing, for delivery to hardly brushed sites. material and methods this randomized controlled double-blind study was performed in 61 subjects with chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal therapy phase (test group: n=27; placebo group: n=28; dropout: n=6). the otc medication was self-applied twice a day for 12wk to two molars with probing pocket depths of 4-6mm. biochemical indicators were evaluated at baseline and 12wk using the suspension array system for eight cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [il]-1, il-1ra, il-4, il-6, il-8, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-) in gingival crevicular fluid. results the levels of il-1, il-6, il-8 and tnf- remained significantly lower in the test group compared to the placebo group. in the placebo group, when the probing pocket depth at baseline was 4mm, il-1 increased, particularly in the second molar tooth, and the greatest increase was seen when ppd at baseline was 5-6mm. in the test group, il-1 decreased markedly in cases with furcation involvement and low bleeding on probing at baseline. in both groups, il-1, il-6 and tnf- were closely correlated with each other. conclusion this otc medication is biochemically effective for steady chronic periodontitis in the supportive periodontal therapy phase.",

    "abstract": "the foxm1 protein is a relevant transcription factor involved in cancer cell proliferation. the direct or indirect inhibition of this protein's transcriptional activity by small molecule drugs correlates well with a potentially significant anti-cancer profile, making this macro molecule a promising drug target. there are a few drug molecules reported to interact with (and inhibit) the foxm1 dna binding domain (foxm1-bd), causing downregulation of protein expression and cancer cell proliferation inhibition. among these drug molecules are the proteasome inhibitor thiostrepton, the former antidiabetic drug troglitazone, and the new fdi-6 molecule. despite their structural differences, these drugs exert a similar inhibitory profile, and this observation prompted us to study a possible similar mechanism of action. using a series of molecular dynamics simulations and docking protocols, we identified essential binding interactions exerted by all three classes of drugs, among which, a -sulfur interaction (between a his287 and a sulfur-containing heterocycle) was the most important. in this report, we describe the preliminary evidence suggesting the presence of a drug-binding pocket within foxm1 dna binding domain, in which inhibitors fit to dissociate the protein-dna complex. this finding suggests a common mechanism of action and a basic framework to design new foxm1 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "there are difficulties associated with mapping gunshot wound (gsw) patterns within opaque models. depending on the damage measurement parameters required, there are multiple techniques that can provide methods of \"seeing\" the gsw pattern within an opaque model. the aim of this paper was to test several of these techniques within a cadaveric animal limb model to determine the most effective. the techniques of interest were flash x-ray, ultrasound, physical dissection, and computed-tomography (ct). fallow deer hind limbs were chosen for the model with four limbs used for each technique tested. quarantined 7.6239mm ammunition was used for each shot, and each limb was only shot once, on an outdoor range with shots impacting at muzzle velocity. flash x-ray provided evidence of yaw within the limb during the projectile's flight; ultrasound though able to visualise the gsw track, was too subjective and was abandoned; dissection proved too unreliable due to the tissue being cadaveric so also too subjective; and lastly, ct with contrast provided excellent imaging in multiple viewing planes and 3d image reconstruction; this allowed versatile measurement of the gsw pattern to collect dimensions of damage as required. of the different techniques examined in this study, ct with contrast proved the most effective to allow precise gsw pattern analysis within a cadaveric animal limb model. these findings may be beneficial to others wishing to undertake further ballistic study both within clinical and forensic fields.",

    "abstract": "various reports indicate that calcyclin binding protein/siah-1-interacting protein (cacybp/sip) is an important protein in tumorigenesis, but whether cacybp/sip promotes or suppresses cancer may depend on the cell type. in order to investigate whether cacybp/sip is significant in gastric cancerous tumorigenesis, the present study used immunohistochemistry to analyze 181 gastric cancer tissue samples, as well as 181 healthy tissue samples from the same gastric cancer patients. the immunohistochemical results were compared against patient data and pathological analysis of the tissue slices, including gender, age, degree of tumor differentiation and tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) stage. in addition, the level of cacybp/sip expression was detected in three frozen tissue samples of gastric adenocarcinoma using western blot analysis. of the 181 cases analyzed in the present study, 80 cases were identified as non-metastatic gastric cancer and 101 cases were identified as gastric cancer that had metastasized to the lymph nodes. tissue biopsies from the two sets of patients were examined using immunohistochemistry to identify the level of cacybp/sip expression in metastatic and primary gastric cancer tissues. statistical analyses were performed on all data. the immunohistochemical analysis revealed that cacybp/sip was expressed in 31% (56/181) of gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples and 7% (12/181) of adjacent non-cancerous gastric tissues (p<0.05). furthermore, the expression levels of cacybp/sip were higher in cancerous tissue compared with the adjacent non-cancerous gastric tissue using western blotting. no association was identified between cacybp/sip expression and patient age (p=0.975), gender (p=0.185), degree of tumor differentiation (p=0.076) or tnm stage (p=0.979). among the 101 patients with metastatic gastric cancer, cacybp/sip was expressed at primary sites in 31% (31/101) of cases and at metastatic sites in 26% (26/101) of cases (p=0.434). however, among the 80 patients with non-metastatic gastric cancer, cacybp/sip was expressed at the tumor site in 34% (27/80) of cases, which was not significantly different from the 31% (25/80) of cases in the metastatic group (p=0.662). these findings indicate that cacybp/sip expression is not a marker of gastric cancer or metastatic gastric cancer, nor does it appear to correlate with the clinicopathological features of gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "background persons with lower limb amputation often experience decreased physical capacity, difficulty walking, and increased fall risk. to either prevent or recover from a loss of balance, one must effectively regulate their stepping movements. it is therefore critical to identify how well persons with amputation regulate stepping. here, we used a multi-objective control framework based on goal equivalent manifolds to identify how persons with transtibial amputation (tta) regulate lateral stepping while walking without and with lateral perturbations. research question when walking in destabilizing environments, do otherwise healthy persons with tta exhibit greater difficulty regulating lateral stepping due to impaired control? or do they instead continue to use similar strategies to regulate lateral stepping despite their amputation? methods eight persons with unilateral tta and thirteen able-bodied (ab) controls walked in a virtual environment under three conditions: no perturbations, laterally oscillating visual field, and laterally oscillating treadmill platform. we analyzed step-to-step time series of step widths and absolute lateral body positions. we computed means, standard deviations and detrended fluctuation analysis scaling exponents for each time series and computed how much participants directly corrected step width and position deviations at each step. we compared our results to computational predictions to identify the underlying causes of our experimental findings. results all participants exhibited significantly increased variability, decreased scaling exponents, and tighter direct control when perturbed. simulations from our stepping regulation models revealed that people responded to the increased variability produced by the imposed perturbations by tightening their control of both step width and lateral position. participants with tta exhibited only a few minor differences from ab in lateral stepping regulation, even when subjected to substantially destabilizing lateral perturbations. significance since control of stepping is intrinsically multi-objective, developing effective interventions to reduce fall risk in persons with amputation will likely require strategies that adopt multi-objective approaches.",

    "abstract": "combustion of fossil fuel is the dominant source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere in california. here, we describe radiocarbon (14co2) measurements and atmospheric inverse modeling to estimate fossil fuel co2 (ffco2) emissions for 2009-2012 from a site in central california, and for june 2013-may 2014 from two sites in southern california. a priori predicted ffco2 mixing ratios are computed based on regional atmospheric transport model (wrf-stilt) footprints and an hourly ffco2 prior emission map (vulcan 2.2). regional inversions using observations from the central california site suggest that emissions from the san francisco bay area (sfba) are higher in winter and lower in summer. taking all years together, the average of a total of fifteen 3-month inversions from 2009 to 2012 suggests ffco2 emissions from sfba were within 635% of the a priori estimate for that region, where posterior emission uncertainties are reported as 95% confidence intervals. results for four 3-month inversions using measurements in los angeles south coast air basin (socab) during june 2013-may 2014 suggest that emissions in socab are within 1328% of the a priori estimate for that region, with marginal detection of any seasonality. while emissions from the sfba and socab urban regions (containing ~50% of prior emissions from california) are constrained by the observations, emissions from the remaining regions are less constrained, suggesting that additional observations will be valuable to more accurately estimate total ffco2 emissions from california as a whole.",

    "abstract": "recent studies have shown that the systematic and repetitive observation of actions belonging to the experiential human motor repertoire without verbal facilitation enhances the recovery of verbs in non fluent aphasia. however, it is still an open question whether this approach extends its efficacy also on discourse productivity by improving the retrieval of other linguistic units (i.e. nouns, sentences, content words). moreover, nothing is known regarding the neural substrates which support the language recovery process due to action observation treatment.in the present study, ten non fluent aphasics were presented with two videoclips (real everyday life context vs. familiar pantomimed context), each video for six consecutive weeks (monday to friday, weekend off). during the treatment, they were asked to observe each video and to describe it without verbal facilitation from the therapist. in all patients, language measures were collected before and at the end of treatment. before and after each treatment condition (real vs. pantomimed context), each subject underwent a resting state fmri. after the treatment, significant changes in functional connectivity were found in right sensory-motor networks which were accompanied by a significant improvement for the different linguistic units in the real context condition. on the contrary, the language recovery obtained in the pantomimed context did not match any functional modification. the evidence for a recruitment of the sensory-motor cortices during the observation of actions embedded in real context suggests to potentially enhance language recovery in non fluent aphasia through a simulation process related to the sensory-motor properties of actions.",

    "abstract": "in this study, we investigated how mercury (hg) concentrations in umbilical cord tissue are correlated with those in biomarkers for prenatal exposure to methylmercury (mehg). total hg (t-hg) concentrations were measured in 54 mother-child paired samples of maternal blood, umbilical cord tissue, cord blood, and maternal hair segments (1-cm incremental segments from the scalp) collected at parturition. mehg concentrations were also measured in the cord tissue. median t-hg and mehg concentrations in cord tissue on a dry-weight basis (d.w.) were 62.2ng/g and 56.7ng/g, respectively. proportions of mehg to t-hg were approximately 95%. both t-hg and mehg in cord tissue (d.w.) showed better correlations with t-hg in cord blood than did t-hg in cord tissue on a wet-weight basis (w.w.). median t-hg concentrations in maternal blood, cord blood, and maternal hair (0-1cm from the scalp) were 3.79ng/g, 7.26ng/g, and 1.35 g/g, respectively. median t-hg concentration in cord blood was 1.92 times higher than that in maternal blood. t-hg in cord tissue (d.w.) showed a strong correlation with that in cord blood (r=0.912, p<0.01). among the hair segments, t-hg in cord tissue (d.w.) showed the strongest correlation (r=0.854, p<0.01) with that in maternal hair at 0-1cm from the scalp, reflecting growth for approximately 1 month before parturition. based on the present results, t-hg and mehg concentrations in cord tissue may be useful biomarkers for prenatal mehg exposure of the fetus, especially reflecting the maternal mehg body burden during late gestation. the conversion factors for t-hg and mehg concentrations in cord tissue (d.w.) to t-hg concentrations in maternal hair (0-1cm from the scalp) were calculated to be 22.37 and 24.09, respectively. this information will be useful for evaluating maternal mehg exposure levels in retrospective studies using preserved umbilical cord tissue.",

    "abstract": "background and purpose: parieto-insular vestibular cortex (pivc) injury can cause symptoms such as abnormal gait and affects the integration and processing of sensory inputs contributing to self-motion perception. therefore, this study investigated the association of the vestibular pathway in the gait and motor function recovery process in patients with pivc injury using diffusion tensor imaging (dti). methods: we recruited 28 patients with stroke with only pivc injury and reconstructed the pivc using a 1.5-t scanner for dti. fractional anisotropy (fa), mean diffusivity (md), and tract volume were measured. the functional ambulatory category (fac) test was conducted, and motricity index (mi) score was determined. these were conducted and determined at the start (phase 1), end of rehabilitation (phase 2), and during the follow-up 6 months after onset. results: although the tract volume of pivc showed a decrease in subgroup a, all of dti parameters were not different between two subgroups in affected side (p > 0.05). the results of mi and fac were significantly different according to the recovery process (p < 0.05). in addition, fa of the pivc showed a positive correlation with fac in phase 2 of the recovery process on the affected side. on the unaffected side, fa of the pivc showed a significant negative correlation with mi in all processes (p < 0.05). conclusion: the degree of projection pathways to pivc injury at onset time seems to be related to early restoration of gait function. moreover, we believe that early detection of the projection pathway for pivc injury using dti would be helpful in the clinical evaluation and prediction of the prognosis of patients with pivc injury.",

    "abstract": "[1] a coupled biophysical model is used to examine the impact of the great arctic cyclone of early august 2012 on the marine planktonic ecosystem in the pacific sector of the arctic ocean (psa). model results indicate that the cyclone influences the marine planktonic ecosystem by enhancing productivity on the shelves of the chukchi, east siberian, and laptev seas during the storm. although the cyclone's passage in the psa lasted only a few days, the simulated biological effects on the shelves last 1 month or longer. at some locations on the shelves, primary productivity (pp) increases by up to 90% and phytoplankton biomass by up to 40% in the wake of the cyclone. the increase in zooplankton biomass is up to 18% on 31 august and remains 10% on 15 september, more than 1 month after the storm. in the central psa, however, model simulations indicate a decrease in pp and plankton biomass. the biological gain on the shelves and loss in the central psa are linked to two factors. (1) the cyclone enhances mixing in the upper ocean, which increases nutrient availability in the surface waters of the shelves; enhanced mixing in the central psa does not increase productivity because nutrients there are mostly depleted through summer draw down by the time of the cyclone's passage. (2) the cyclone also induces divergence, resulting from the cyclone's low-pressure system that drives cyclonic sea ice and upper ocean circulation, which transports more plankton biomass onto the shelves from the central psa. the simulated biological gain on the shelves is greater than the loss in the central psa, and therefore, the production on average over the entire psa is increased by the cyclone. because the gain on the shelves is offset by the loss in the central psa, the average increase over the entire psa is moderate and lasts only about 10 days. the generally positive impact of cyclones on the marine ecosystem in the arctic, particularly on the shelves, is likely to grow with increasing summer cyclone activity if the arctic continues to warm and the ice cover continues to shrink.",

    "abstract": "background traumatic brain injury (tbi) is a major cause of cns neurodegeneration and has no disease-altering therapies. it is commonly associated with a specific type of biomechanical disruption of the axon called traumatic axonal injury (tai), which often leads to axonal and sometimes perikaryal degeneration of cns neurons. we have previously used genome-scale, arrayed rna interference-based screens in primary mouse retinal ganglion cells (rgcs) to identify a pair of related kinases, dual leucine zipper kinase (dlk) and leucine zipper kinase (lzk) that are key mediators of cell death in response to simple axotomy. moreover, we showed that dlk and lzk are the major upstream triggers for jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling following total axonal transection. however, the degree to which dlk/lzk are involved in tai/tbi is unknown. methods here we used the impact acceleration (ia) model of diffuse tbi, which produces tai in the visual system, and complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches to disrupt dlk and lzk, and explored whether dlk and lzk play a role in rgc perikaryal and axonal degeneration in response to tai. results our findings show that the ia model activates dlk/jnk/jun signaling but, in contrast to axotomy, many rgcs are able to recover from the injury and terminate the activation of the pathway. moreover, while dlk disruption is sufficient to suppress jun phosphorylation, combined dlk and lzk inhibition is required to prevent rgc cell death. finally, we show that the fda-approved protein kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, which has activity against dlk and lzk, is able to produce similar increases in rgc survival. conclusion the mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinases (map3ks), dlk and lzk, participate in cell death signaling of cns neurons in response to tbi. moreover, sustained pharmacologic inhibition of dlk is neuroprotective, an effect creating an opportunity to potentially translate these findings to patients with tbi.",

'pinnacle') leaves were excised and incubated in 3 mm 2-(n-morpholino) ethanesulfonic buffer (ph 5.8) supplemented with melatonin or water (control) and exposed to dark treatment for 8 days. leaves treated with melatonin maintained significantly higher endogenous melatonin level, chlorophyll content, photochemical efficiency, and cell membrane stability expressed by lower electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (mda) content compared to the control. exogenous melatonin treatment also reduced the transcript level of chlorophyll degradation-associated genes and senescence marker genes (lpsag12.1, lph36, and lpl69) during the dark treatment. the endogenous o2- production rate and h2o2 content were significantly lower in these excised leaves treated with melatonin compared to the water control. exogenous melatonin treatment caused increases in enzymatic activity and transcript levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase but had no significant effects on ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and monohydroascorbate reductase. the content of non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as ascorbate and dehydroascorbate, were decreased by melatonin treatment, while the content of glutathione and oxidized glutathione was not affected by melatonin. these results suggest that the suppression of dark-induced leaf senescence by exogenous melatonin may be associated with its roles in regulating ros scavenging through activating the superoxide dismutase-catalase enzymatic antioxidant pathway and down-regulating chlorophyll degradation in perennial ryegrass.",

    "abstract": "the diverse nature of complex drug products poses challenges for the development of regulatory guidelines for generic versions. while complexity is not new in medicines, the technical capacity to measure and analyze data has increased. this requires a determination of which measurements and studies are relevant to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence. this paper describes the views of the nbcd working group and provides pragmatic solutions for approving complex generics by making best use of existing u.s. food and drug administration's abbreviated approval pathways 505(j) and 505(b)(2). we argue that decisions on the appropriateness of submitting a 505(j) or 505(b)(2) application can build on the fda's complex drug product classification as well as the fda's much applauded guidance document for determining whether to submit an anda or a 505(b)(2) application. we hope that this paper contributes to the discussions to increase the clarity of regulatory approaches for complex generics, as well as the predictability for complex generic drug developers, to facilitate access to much-needed complex generics and to promote the sustainability of the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "studies that test community assembly hypotheses in observational communities frequently evaluate patterns for plots or entire communities, yet studies that examine assembly patterns across spatial scales show that they are greatly influenced by scale. here, we test the spatial dependency of patterns of relatedness and plant height for all individual herbaceous plants along five 40-m old-field transects (southern ontario, canada). we identified each individual plant and measured its distance along the transect and its height, and we constructed a molecular phylogeny for all observed species. to uncover the scale at which community phylogenetic and trait similarities shift, we used partial mantel correlograms and distance-based moran eigenvector maps (dbmems). we found that communities shift from significantly overdispersed at relatively smaller scales (i.e.,<15m) to spatially clustered at larger scales, showing that assembly mechanism influence depends on scale of observation. this pattern was observed for both phylogeny and height, but was the strongest when considering phylogeny only. these results reveal the importance of spatial scale when examining community phylogenetic or trait patterns, where finding support for one assembly mechanism at a single scale does not necessarily mean that other mechanisms are also not important for structuring community composition and diversity.",

    "abstract": "h1n1 (swine flu) is caused by influenza a virus, which is a member of orthomyxoviridae family. transmission of h1n1 occurs from human to human through air or sometimes from pigs to humans. the influenza virus has different rna segments, which can reassert to make new virus strain with the possibility to create an outbreak in unimmunized people. gene reassortment is a process through which new strains are emerging in pigs, as it has specific receptors for both human influenza and avian influenza viruses. h1n1 binds specifically with an -2,6 glycosidic bond, which is present in human respiratory tract cells as well as in pigs. considering the fact of fast multiplication of viruses inside the living cells, rapid detection methods need an hour. currently, who recommended methods for the detection of swine flu include real-time pcr in specific testing centres that take 3-4 h. more recently, a number of methods such as antigen-antibody or rt-lamp and dna biosensors have also been developed that are rapid and more sensitive. this review describes the various challenges in the diagnosis of h1n1, and merits and demerits of conventional vis-a-vis latest methods with special emphasis on biosensors.",

    "abstract": "background localization and differential expression of stat3 and survivin in cancer cells are often related to distinct cellular functions. the involvement of survivin and stat3 in gastric cancer has been reported in separate studies but without clear understanding of their kinetics in cancer progression. methods we examined intracellular distribution of stat3 and survivin in gastric adenocarcinoma and compared it with normal and precancer tissues using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. results analysis of a total of 156 gastric samples comprising 61 histologically normal, 30 precancerous tissues (comprising intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia), and 65 adenocarcinomas, collected as endoscopic biopsies from treatment naive study participants, revealed a significant (p<.001) increase in overall protein levels. survivin expression was detectable in both cytoplasmic (90.8%) and nuclear (87.7%) compartments in gastric adenocarcinomas lesions. precancerous dysplastic gastric lesions exhibited a moderate survivin expression (56.7%) localized in cytoplasmic compartment. similarly, stat3 and pstat3 expression was detected at high level in gastric cancer lesions. the levels of compartmentalized expression of survivin and stat3/pstat3 correlated in precancerous and adenocarcinoma lesions. although overexpression of these proteins was found associated with the tobacco use and alcohol consumption, their expression invariably and strongly correlated with concurrent helicobacter pylori infection. receiver operating characteristic analysis of nuclear survivin, stat3, and pstat3 in different study groups showed acceptable positive and negative predictive values with area under the curve above 0.8 (p<.001). conclusion overall, our results suggest that overall increase in survivin and stat3 and their subcellular localization are key determinants of gastric cancer progression, which can be collectively used as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "background guard cells (gcs) are specialised cells within the plant epidermis which form stomatal pores, through which gas exchange can occur. the gcs derive through a specialised lineage of cell divisions which is specified by the transcription factor speechless (spch), the expression of which can be detected in undifferentiated epidermal cells prior to asymmetric division. other transcription factors may act before gc specification and be required for correct gc patterning. previously, the dof transcription factor stomatal carpenter 1 (scap1) was shown to be involved in gc function, by activating a set of gc-specific genes required for gc maturation and activity. it is thus far unknown whether scap1 can also affect stomatal development. results here we show that scap1 expression can also be observed in young leaf primordia, before any gc differentiation occurs. the study of transgenic plants carrying a proscap1:gus-gfp transcriptional fusion, coupled with qpcr analyses, indicate that scap1 expression peaks in a temporal window which is coincident with expression of stomatal patterning genes. independent scap1 loss-of-function mutants have a reduced number of gcs whilst scap1 over expression lines have an increased number of gcs, in addition to altered gc distribution and spacing patterns. the study of early markers for stomatal cell lineage in a background carrying gain-of-function alleles of scap1 revealed that, compared to the wild type, an increased number of protodermal cells are recruited in the gc lineage, which is reflected in an increased number of meristemoids. conclusions our results suggest an early role for scap1 in gc differentiation. we propose that a function of scap1 is to integrate different aspects of gc biology including specification, spacing, maturation and function.",

    "abstract": "an intelligent emergency system for hazard monitoring and building evacuation is a very important application area in internet of things (iot) technology. through the use of smart sensors, such a system can provide more vital and reliable information to first-responders and also reduce the incidents of false alarms. several smart monitoring and warning systems do already exist, though they exhibit key weaknesses such as a limited monitoring coverage and security, which have not yet been sufficiently addressed. in this paper, we propose a monitoring and emergency response method for buildings by utilizing beacons and unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) on an iot security platform. in order to demonstrate the practicability of our method, we also implement a proof of concept prototype, which we call the uav-emor (uav-assisted emergency monitoring and response) system. our uav-emor system provides the following novel features: (1) secure communications between uavs, smart sensors, the control server and a smartphone app for security managers; (2) enhanced coordination between smart sensors and indoor/outdoor uavs to expand real-time monitoring coverage; and (3) beacon-aided rescue and building evacuation.",

    "abstract": "purpose the surgical treatment of thoracic myelopathy is still controversial and also a challenge for spine surgeons. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the related literature on the surgical treatment of thoracic myelopathy and try to define treatment guidelines for spine surgeons on thoracic myelopathy. methods relevant literatures were searched based on the pubmed, embase, and cochrane library between january 2008 and december 2018. some data on the characteristics of patients were extracted, including number of patients, mean age, surgical procedures, blood loss, complications, and pre-/post-operation modified joa score. recovery rate was used to assess the effect of surgery outcome, and the safety was evaluated by blood loss and incidence of complications. results thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and were retrieved. a total of 2183 patients were included in our systematic review, with the average age of 55.2years. there were 69.8% patients diagnosed as ossification of ligamentum flavum (olf), 20.0% as ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (opll), 9.3% as disk herniation (dh), and 0.9% as others including diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (dish) and ankylosing spondylitis (as). the volume of blood loss was more in the treatment of circumferential decompression (cd) than posterior decompression (pd), and the incidence of complications was higher in cd (p < 0.05). the volume of blood loss in minimally invasive surgery (mis) was lowest and the incidence of complications was 19.2%. post-operation recovery rate was 0.49 in pd, 0.35 in cd, and 0.29 in mis while the recovery rate was 0.54 in pd, 0.55 in cd, and 0.49 in mis at the last follow-up. when focusing on the olf specifically, incidence of complications in pd was much lower than cd, with less blood loss and higher recovery rate. focusing on the opll specifically, incidence of complications in pd was much lower than cd, with less blood loss while there was no statistical difference in recovery rate between these two methods. conclusions this systematic review showed that posterior decompression for thoracic myelopathy is safer and better than circumferential decompression according to the complication rate and surgical outcome. and we should also consider the location of compression before the operation.",

    "abstract": "the indian prime minister, narendra modi, while addressing the united nations general assembly on 26 september 2020, stated that india had introduced legal reforms to accord rights to transgender citizens. even though there is not much material basis to these rights, transgender communities have been protesting against the state and at times negotiating with it to get laws that are more in alignment with their rights. in the wake of serialised deaths and precarity intensified by the covid-19 pandemic, transgender communities also stage other negotiations in the everyday with activists, transnationally funded ngos and academics researching their communities, encounters that are not as spectacular as the protests against the state, but that which ensures their daily sustenance. this paper investigates how they inhabit these systemically violent institutions. deploying ethnographic field notes from eastern india, this paper argues that they inhabit them subjunctively, which is not about refusing engagement with what is oppressive but about the ceaseless conjuring of improvisatory and contingent gestures that are marked by hope as well as uncertainty. the simultaneity of protests, rage, hopelessness, hope, negotiations, supplications and scepticism allow them to not only endure the violence of institutions but also to rupture them and imagine them otherwise.",

    "abstract": "the murine model of leishmania major infection has been an invaluable tool in understanding t helper differentiation in vivo. the initial evidence for a role of distinct cd4(+) t helper subsets in the outcome of infection was first obtained with this experimental model. the development of cd4(+) th1 cells was associated with resolution of the lesion, control of parasite replication, and resistance to re-infection in most of the mouse strains investigated (i.e., c57bl/6). in contrast, differentiation of cd4(+) th2 cells correlated with the development of unhealing lesions, and failure to control parasite load in a few strains (i.e., balb/c). since these first reports, an incredible amount of effort has been devoted to understanding the various parameters involved in the differentiation of these, and more recently discovered t helper subsets such as th17 and t regulatory cells. the discovery of cross-talk between t helper subsets, as well as their plasticity force us to reevaluate the events driving a protective/deleterious t helper immune response following infection with l. major in mice. in this review, we describe the individual contributions of each of these cd4(+) t helper subsets following l. major inoculation, emphasizing recent advances in the field, such as the impact of different substrains of l. major on the pathogenesis of disease.",

    "abstract": "new findings what is the central question of this study? does vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) expressed by both endothelial cells and skeletal myofibres maintain the number of skeletal muscle capillaries and regulate endurance exercise? what is the main finding and its importance? vegf expressed by both endothelial cells and skeletal myofibres is not essential for maintaining capillary number but does contribute to exercise performance. abstract many chronic diseases lead to exercise intolerance, with loss of skeletal muscle capillaries. while many muscle cell types (myofibres, satellite cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts) express vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), most muscle vegf is stored in myofibre vesicles which can release vegf to signal vegf receptor-expressing cells. vegf gene ablation in myofibres or endothelial cells alone does not cause capillary regression. we hypothesized that simultaneously deleting the endothelial cell (ec) and skeletal myofibre (skm) vegf gene would cause capillary regression and impair exercise performance. this was tested in adult mice by simultaneous conditional deletion of the vegf gene (skm/ec-vegf-/- mice) through the use of vegfloxp, hsa-cre-ert2 and pdgfb-icre-ert2 transgenes. these double-deletion mice were compared to three control groups - wt, ec vegf gene deletion alone and myofibre vegf gene deletion alone. three weeks after initiating gene deletion, skm/ec-vegf-/- mice, but not skmvegf-/- or ec-vegf-/- mice, reached exhaustion 40min sooner than wt mice in treadmill tests (p=0.002). wt, skmvegf-/- and ec-vegf-/- , but not skm/ec-vegf-/- , mice gained weight over the 3weeks. capillary density, fibre area and capillary: fibre ratio in soleus, plantaris, gastrocnemius and cardiac papillary muscle were similar across the groups. phosphofructokinase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities increased only in skm/ec-vegf-/- mice. these data suggest that deletion of the vegf gene simultaneously in endothelial cells and myofibres, while reducing treadmill endurance and despite compensatory augmentation of glycolysis, is not required for muscle capillary maintenance. reduced endurance remains unexplained, but may possibly be related to a role for vegf in controlling perfusion of contracting muscle.",

(bone 46(4):<phone>, 2010) strongly suggest that the lacunar pores are likely to experience, during typical physiological load cycles, not only fluid transport, but also undrained conditions. the latter entail the buildup of lacunar pore pressures, which we here quantify by means of a thorough multiscale modeling approach. in particular, the proposed model is based on classical poroelasticity theory, and able to account for multiple pore spaces. first, the model reveals distinct nonlinear dependencies of the resulting lacunar (and vascular) pore pressures on the underlying bone composition, highlighting the importance of a rigorous multiscale approach for appropriate computation of the aforementioned pore pressures. then, the derived equations are evaluated for macroscopic (uniaxial as well as hydrostatic) mechanical loading of physiological magnitude. the resulting model-predicted pore pressures agree very well with the pressures that have been revealed, by means of in vitro studies, to be of adequate magnitude for modulating the responses of biological cells, including osteocytes. this underlines that osteocytes may respond to many types of loading stimuli at the same time, in particular so to fluid flow and hydrostatic pressure.",

    "title": "investigation of the confinement effect on the evaporation behavior of a droplet pinned on a micropillar structure.",
    "abstract": "evaporation of sessile droplet suffers from reduced evaporation rate due to the confinement of vapor diffusion imposed by the bottom substrate. however, it is possible to change the evaporation behavior of a droplet by suspending it from the bottom substrate, in particular, supporting the droplet on a micropillar. this is expected to enable diffusion transport in the downward direction that will subsequently enhance evaporative transport. in this study, we investigate the diffusion confinement effect imposed by the bottom substrate and the side wall of the micropillar through numerical simulations and experimental investigation. the approximate solutions for total evaporation rate and local evaporative flux were subsequently derived from the total evaporation rate predicted by the simulation results. the simulation results, agreeing within 5% with the experimental measurements, show that increasing the micropillar height enhances the total evaporation rate from the suspended hemispherical droplet. this enhancement is due to a dramatic improvement of the local evaporation rate near the contact line region as micropillar heights increase. the micropillar heights examined for maximum evaporation rates were observed under substrate temperatures from 60-98c. the increasing pillar height leads to smaller vapor diffusion resistance but greater conduction resistance.",

    "abstract": "aims post-fracture calcium and phosphorus excretion is greater than influx, which might be caused by stress. glucocorticoid is known to enhance calcium and phosphorous excretion, and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on glucocorticoid. therefore, this study explored whether h2s could inhibit calcium and phosphorus loss after fracture by regulating glucocorticoid and/or its receptor. main methods the following properties were analyzed in rats with femur fractures: serum and urinary calcium and phosphorus (by colorimetry); bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, serum type 1 collagen amino terminal peptide, type 1 procollagen carboxy terminal peptide, and anti-tartaric acid phosphatase (by elisa); factors related to calcium-phosphorus metabolism including glucocorticoid, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 1,25(oh)2d3 (by elisa); and sulfhydration of glucocorticoid receptor in the kidney (by immunoprecipitation linked biotin-switch assay), after supplementing with mifepristone, the h2s donor gyy4137 or h2s generating enzyme inhibitors aminooxyacetic acid and propargylglycine. key findings serum h2s decreased and glucocorticoid secretion increased in rats post-fracture. the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor mifepristone partly blunted calcium and phosphorus loss. furthermore, supplementation with gyy4137 reduced glucocorticoid secretion; inhibited glucocorticoid receptor activity by sulfhydration; downregulated vitamin d 1-hydroxylase expression; and upregulated 24-hydroxylase, calbindin-d28k, and sodium phosphate cotransporter 2a expression in the kidney; thereby inhibiting calcium and phosphorus loss induced by fracture. moreover, inhibiting endogenous h2s generation showed opposite effects. significance our findings suggest that h2s antagonized calcium and phosphorus loss after fracture by reducing glucocorticoid secretion and inhibiting glucocorticoid receptor activity by sulfhydration.",

    "abstract": "background experimental and clinical evidence support a link between body representations and pain. this proof-of-concept study in people with painful knee osteoarthritis (oa) aimed to determine if: (i) visuotactile illusions that manipulate perceived knee size are analgesic; (ii) cumulative analgesic effects occur with sustained or repeated illusions. methods participants with knee oa underwent eight conditions (order randomised): stretch and shrink visuotactile (congruent) illusions and corresponding visual, tactile and incongruent control conditions. knee pain intensity (0-100 numerical rating scale; 0 = no pain at all and 100 = worst pain imaginable) was assessed pre- and post-condition. condition (visuotactile illusion vs control) time (pre-/post-condition) repeated measure anovas evaluated the effect on pain. in each participant, the most beneficial illusion was sustained for 3min and was repeated 10 times (each during two sessions); paired t-tests compared pain at time 0 and 180s (sustained) and between illusion 1 and illusion 10 (repeated). results visuotactile illusions decreased pain by an average of 7.8 points (95% ci [2.0-13.5]) which corresponds to a 25% reduction in pain, but the tactile only and visual only control conditions did not (condition time interaction: p=0.028). visuotactile illusions did not differ from incongruent control conditions where the same visual manipulation occurred, but did differ when only the same tactile input was applied. sustained illusions prolonged analgesia, but did not increase it. repeated illusions increased the analgesic effect with an average pain decrease of 20 points (95% ci [6.9-33.1])-corresponding to a 40% pain reduction. discussion visuotactile illusions are analgesic in people with knee oa. our results suggest that visual input plays a critical role in pain relief, but that analgesia requires multisensory input. that visual and tactile input is needed for analgesia, supports multisensory modulation processes as a possible explanatory mechanism. further research exploring the neural underpinnings of these visuotactile illusions is needed. for potential clinical applications, future research using a greater dosage in larger samples is warranted.",

    "abstract": "frequencies and biomass of baltic sea cyanobacterial blooms are expected to be higher in future climate conditions, but also of longer duration as a result of increased sea surface temperature. concurrently, climate predictions indicate a reduced salinity in the baltic sea. these climate-driven changes are expected to alter not solely the phytoplankton community but also the role of microbial communities for nutrient remineralization. here, we present the response of summer plankton communities (filamentous cyanobacteria, picocyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria) to the interplay of increasing temperature (from 16 to 18c and 20c) and reduced salinity (from salinity 6.9 to 5.9) in the baltic proper (nw gotland sea) using a microcosm approach. warmer temperatures led to an earlier peak of cyanobacterial biomass, while yields were reduced. these conditions caused a decrease of nitrogen-fixers (dolichospermum sp.) biomass, while non nitrogen-fixers (pseudanabaena sp.) increased. salinity reduction did not affect cyanobacterial growth nor community composition. among heterotrophic bacteria, actinobacteria showed preference for high temperature, while gammaproteobacteria thrived at in situ temperature. heterotrophic bacteria community changed drastically at lower salinity and resembled communities at high temperature. picocyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacterial biomass had a pronounced increase associated with the decay of filamentous cyanobacteria. this suggests that shifts in community composition of heterotrophic bacteria are influenced both directly by abiotic factors (temperature and salinity) and potentially indirectly by cyanobacteria. our findings suggest that at warmer temperature, lower yield of photosynthetic cyanobacteria combined with lower proportion of nitrogen-fixers in the community could result in lower carbon export to the marine food web with consequences for the decomposer community of heterotrophic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "background with the available evidence of early combined oral drug therapies being more effective in lowering blood glucose levels than maximal doses of a single drug, many clinicians are taking the aggressive approach of adding a sulfonylurea or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp-4) inhibitor to metformin as the initial therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). pharmacotherapy for a chronic disease like diabetes has substantial economic implications for patients especially in a developing country like india. so it is important to scientifically evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these commonly practiced combination therapies in the management of t2dm. materials and methods this was a prospective observational randomized comparative study conducted over 8 weeks on patients of t2dm who were prescribed either of the two therapies of metformin (500 mg) plus glimepiride (1 mg) or metformin (500 mg) plus teneligliptin (20 mg). cost-effectiveness analysis was done by calculating the expense incurred on 0.1% reduction in hba1 c and 1 mg/dl reduction in fasting plasma glucose (fpg)/post-prandial plasma glucose (ppg) levels after 8 weeks and compared for both the groups. the same was also evaluated for differences in bmi levels. results the cost-effectiveness for per unit reduction in hba1c and fpg was significant in metformin plus glimepiride group as compared to the metformin plus teneligliptin group though it was comparable for both the groups for per unit ppg reduction. there was no significant change in bmi levels between the groups. conclusion compared to metformin plus teneligliptin, metformin plus glimepiride is a significantly cost-effective therapy when used as an initial combination therapy in patients of t2dm in lowering hba1c and fpg.",

    "abstract": "environmental risk assessment of chemicals is reliant on good estimates of product usage information and robust exposure models. over the past 20 to 30 years, much progress has been made with the development of exposure models that simulate the transport and distribution of chemicals in the environment. however, little progress has been made in our ability to estimate chemical emissions of home and personal care (hpc) products. in this project, we have developed an approach to estimate subnational emission inventory of chemical ingredients used in hpc products for 12 asian countries including bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, indonesia, laos, malaysia, pakistan, philippines, sri lanka, thailand, and vietnam (asia-12). to develop this inventory, we have coupled a 1km grid of per capita gross domestic product (gdp) estimates with market research data of hpc product sales. we explore the necessity of accounting for a population's ability to purchase hpc products in determining their subnational distribution in regions where wealth is not uniform. the implications of using high resolution data on inter- and intracountry subnational emission estimates for a range of hypothetical and actual hpc product types were explored. it was demonstrated that for low value products (<500 us$ per capita/annum required to purchase product) the maximum deviation from baseline (emission distributed via population) is less than a factor of 3 and it would not result in significant differences in chemical risk assessments. however, for other product types (>500 us$ per capita/annum required to purchase product) the implications on emissions being assigned to subnational regions can vary by several orders of magnitude. the implications of this on conducting national or regional level risk assessments may be significant. further work is needed to explore the implications of this variability in hpc emissions to enable the hpc industry and/or governments to advance risk-based chemical management policies in emerging markets.",

    "abstract": "skeletal muscle contains intramyocellular lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of myocytes as well as intermuscular adipocytes. these depots exhibit physiological and pathological variation which has been revealed with the advent of diagnostic imaging approaches: magnetic resonance (mr) imaging, mr spectroscopy and computed tomography (ct). ct uses computer-processed x-rays and is now being applied in muscle physiology research. the purpose of this review is to present ct methodologies and summarize factors that influence muscle radiation attenuation, a parameter which is inversely related to muscle fat content. pre-defined radiation attenuation ranges are used to demarcate intermuscular adipose tissue [from -190 to -30 hounsfield units (hu)] and muscle (-29 hu to +150 hu). within the latter range, the mean muscle radiation attenuation [muscle (radio) density] is reported. inconsistent criteria for the upper and lower hu cut-offs used to characterize muscle attenuation limit comparisons between investigations. this area of research would benefit from standardized criteria for reporting muscle attenuation. available evidence suggests that muscle attenuation is plastic with physiological variation induced by the process of ageing, as well as by aerobic training, which probably reflects accumulation of lipids to fuel aerobic work. pathological variation in muscle attenuation reflects excess fat deposition in the tissue and is observed in people with obesity, diabetes type ii, myositis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis and cancer. a poor prognosis and different types of morbidity are predicted by the presence of reduced mean muscle attenuation values in patients with these conditions; however, the biological features of muscle with these characteristics require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "the application of nanotechnology to the petroleum industry has sparked recent interest in increasing oil recovery, while reducing environmental impact. nanocellulose is an emerging nanoparticle that is derived from trees or waste stream from wood and fiber industries. thus, it is taken from a renewable and sustainable source, and could therefore serve as a good alternative to current enhanced oil recovery (eor) technologies. however, before nanocellulose can be applied as an eor technique, further understanding of its transport behavior and retention in porous media is required. the research documented in this paper examines retention mechanisms that occur during nanocellulose transport. in a series of experiments, nanocellulose particles dispersed in brine were injected into sandpacks and berea sandstone cores. the resulting retention and permeability reduction were measured. the experimental parameters that were varied include sand grain size, nanocellulose type, salinity, and flow rate. under low salinity conditions, the dominant retention mechanism was adsorption and when salinity was increased, the dominant retention mechanism shifted towards log-jamming. retention and permeability reduction increased as grain size decreased, which results from increased straining of nanocellulose aggregates. in addition, each type of nanocellulose was found to have significantly different transport properties. experiments with berea sandstone cores indicate that some pore volume was inaccessible to the nanocellulose. as a general trend, the larger the size of aggregates in bulk solution, the greater the observed retention and permeability reduction. salinity was found to be the most important parameter affecting transport. increased salinity caused additional aggregation, which led to increased straining and filter cake formation. higher flow rates were found to reduce retention and permeability reduction. increased velocity was accompanied by an increase in shear, which is believed to promote breakdown of nanocellulose aggregates.",

    "abstract": "biologically relevant large-scale computational models currently represent one of the main methods in neuroscience for studying information processing primitives of brain areas. however, biologically realistic neuron models tend to be computationally heavy and thus prevent these models from being part of brain-area models including thousands or even millions of neurons. the cerebellar input layer represents a canonical example of large scale networks. in particular, the cerebellar granule cells, the most numerous cells in the whole mammalian brain, have been proposed as playing a pivotal role in the creation of somato-sensorial information representations. enhanced burst frequency (spiking resonance) in the granule cells has been proposed as facilitating the input signal transmission at the theta-frequency band (4-12 hz), but the functional role of this cell feature in the operation of the granular layer remains largely unclear. this study aims to develop a methodological pipeline for creating neuron models that maintain biological realism and computational efficiency whilst capturing essential aspects of single-neuron processing. therefore, we selected a light computational neuron model template (the adaptive-exponential integrate-and-fire model), whose parameters were progressively refined using an automatic parameter tuning with evolutionary algorithms (eas). the resulting point-neuron models are suitable for reproducing the main firing properties of a realistic granule cell from electrophysiological measurements, including the spiking resonance at the theta-frequency band, repetitive firing according to a specified intensity-frequency (i-f) curve and delayed firing under current-pulse stimulation. interestingly, the proposed model also reproduced some other emergent properties (namely, silent at rest, rheobase and negligible adaptation under depolarizing currents) even though these properties were not set in the ea as a target in the fitness function (ff), proving that these features are compatible even in computationally simple models. the proposed methodology represents a valuable tool for adjusting adex models according to a ff defined in the spiking regime and based on biological data. these models are appropriate for future research of the functional implication of bursting resonance at the theta band in large-scale granular layer network models.",

    "abstract": "studies on the determinants of plant-herbivore and herbivore-parasitoid associations provide important insights into the origin and maintenance of global and local species richness. if parasitoids are specialists on herbivore niches rather than on herbivore taxa, then alternating escape of herbivores into novel niches and delayed resource tracking by parasitoids could fuel diversification at both trophic levels. we used dna barcoding to identify parasitoids that attack larvae of seven pontania sawfly species that induce leaf galls on eight willow species growing in subarctic and arctic-alpine habitats in three geographic locations in northern fennoscandia, and then applied distance- and model-based multivariate analyses and phylogenetic regression methods to evaluate the hierarchical importance of location, phylogeny and different galler niche dimensions on parasitoid host use. we found statistically significant variation in parasitoid communities across geographic locations and willow host species, but the differences were mainly quantitative due to extensive sharing of enemies among gallers within habitat types. by contrast, the divide between habitats defined two qualitatively different network compartments, because many common parasitoids exhibited strong habitat preference. galler and parasitoid phylogenies did not explain associations, because distantly related arctic-alpine gallers were attacked by a species-poor enemy community dominated by two parasitoid species that most likely have independently tracked the gallers' evolutionary shifts into the novel habitat. our results indicate that barcode- and phylogeny-based analyses of food webs that span forested vs. tundra or grassland environments could improve our understanding of vertical diversification effects in complex plant-herbivore-parasitoid networks.",

    "abstract": "hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) often develops from chronic hepatitis b (chb) through replication of hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. calcium (ca2+) signaling plays an essential role in hbv replication. store-operated calcium (soc) channels are a major pathway of ca2+ entry into non-excitable cells such as immune cells and cancer cells. the basic components of soc signaling include the stim1 and orai1 genes. however, the roles of stim1 and orai1 in hbv-mediated hcc are still unclear. thus, long-term follow-up of hbv cohort was carried out in this study. this study recruited 3631 patients with chronic hepatitis (345 patients with hcc, 3286 patients without hcc) in a taiwanese population. genetic variants of the stim1 and orai1 genes were detected using an axiom chb1 genome-wide array. clinical associations of 40 polymorphisms were analyzed. three of the stim1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (rs6578418, rs7116520, and rs11030472) and one snp of orai1 (rs6486795) showed a trend of being associated with hcc disease (p < 0.05). however, after correction for multiple testing, none of the snps reached a significant level (q > 0.05); in contrast, neither stim1 nor orai1 showed a significant association with hcc progression in chb patients. functional studies by both total internal reflection fluorescence images and transwell migration assay indicated the critical roles of soc-mediated signaling in hcc migration. in conclusion, we reported a weak correlation between stim1/orai1 polymorphisms and the risk of hcc progression in chb patients.",

    "abstract": "nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) is a major health problem worldwide. currently, there is a lack of conclusive information to clarify the molecular events and mechanisms responsible for the progression of nafld to fibrosis and cirrhosis and, more importantly, for differences in interindividual disease severity. the aim of this study was to investigate a role of interindividual differences in iron metabolism among inbred mouse strains in the pathogenesis and severity of fibrosis in a model of nafld. feeding male a/j, 129s1/svimj and wsb/eij mice a choline- and folate-deficient diet caused nafld-associated liver injury and iron metabolism abnormalities, especially in wsb/eij mice. nafld-associated fibrogenesis was correlated with a marked strain- and injury-dependent increase in the expression of iron metabolism genes, especially transferrin receptor (tfrc), ferritin heavy chain (fth1), and solute carrier family 40 (iron-regulated transporter), member 1 (slc40a1, fpn1) and their related proteins, and pronounced down-regulation of the iron regulatory protein 1 (irp1), with the magnitude being a/j<129s1/svimj<wsb/eij. mechanistically, down-regulation of irp1 was linked to an increased expression of micrornas mir-200a and mir-223, which was negatively correlated with irp1. the results of this study demonstrate that the interstrain variability in the extent of fibrogenesis was associated with a strain-dependent deregulation of hepatic iron homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "since 2006, sierra leone has achieved high rates of vitamin a supplementation (vas) coverage (>88%) during mass campaigns. in 2017, campaigns started transitioning to routine vas within a six-monthly contact point for integrated reproductive and child health (rch) services. this contact point included improved counselling and provision of modern contraceptives; throughout this transition high vas coverage (>85%) has been maintained. vas programmes have traditionally operated on the assumption that they are gender-neutral, but recent research suggests these programmes should re-examine how they interact with gender. this qualitative study examined intersections between gender and sierra leone's integrated vas programming by conducting 32 individual interviews with parents, district health management and national staff, and six focus group discussions with health workers and community health workers (chws) in three pilot program districts. the study found that most senior health positions are held by males, and the lower cadres of majority female health workers often felt unsupported/disrespected by their male superiors and male chw supervisees, or that their years of experience were overlooked in favour of the academic qualifications of less experienced male colleagues. gender was not included in program training, and most staff did not have a good understanding of gender intersections; however, health workers actively engaged in awareness raising with male stakeholders to increase male involvement in rch. routine delivery requires mothers to invest time and money to access health facilities, where most mothers felt that better qualified staff were able to offer better advice and more services. health workers felt that outreach services utilizing chws could decrease this time/money burden; however, chws are unqualified to provide counselling and provision of modern contraception, and there are fewer female chws. records kept in health facilities record vas by sex, but monthly reports submitted to the district and onwards to the national health management information system are not disaggregated by sex. programme and policymakers should consider improving the representation by females in senior, decision-making positions, integrating gender information into all trainings, supporting female health workers, training and recruiting more female chws, and reporting vas coverage by sex.",

    "abstract": "we report the first 18o and 2h data of virunga rainfall in the eastern democratic republic of the congo, situated on the limit between central and eastern africa. the dataset is from 13 rain gauges deployed at mount nyiragongo and its surroundings sampled monthly between december 2013 and october 2015. the 18o and 2h vary from -6.44 to 6.16, and -32.53 to 58.89 respectively, and allowed us to define a lmwl of 2h=7.6018o+16.18. three main wind directions, i.e. ne, e and se, were identified in the upper atmosphere corresponding to three major moisture source regions. on the contrary, lower atmospheric winds are weaker in nature and originate mainly from the s and sw, creating a topographically-driven, more local moisture regime. the latter is due to the accumulation in the floor of the rift of water vapor from lake kivu forming a layer of isotopically enriched vapor that mediates the isotope enrichment of the falling raindrops. a strong seasonality is observed in both 18o and 2h data, and is primarily driven by combined seasonal and spatial variation in the moisture sources. the 18o and 2h seasonality is thus correlated to weather patterns, as the latter control the wet to dry season shifting, and vice versa. the key characteristic of seasonality is the variation of monthly precipitation amounts, since the mean monthly air temperature is nearly constant on an annual scale. two regionally relevant hydrological processes contribute to the isotopic signature: namely moisture uptake from the isotopically enriched surface waters of east african lakes and from the depleted soil-water and plants. consequently, the proportion of water vapor from each of these reservoirs in the atmosphere drives the enrichment or depletion of 2h and 18o in the precipitation. thus, during wet periods the vapor from soil-plants evapotranspiration dominates yielding isotopically depleted precipitation, contrary to dry periods when vapor from lakes surface evaporation dominates, yielding isotopically enriched precipitation. at the global scale, our dataset reduces gaps in this region that has been poorly studied for 18o and 2h in precipitation. at the regional scale, the improved understanding of the ways land cover, moisture source seasonal and spatial dynamics, and atmospheric patterns impact precipitation spatial and temporal variabilities in central-east african will contribute to the ongoing research on mitigating the impacts of ongoing climate change in sub-saharan africa. the reduction of gaps and uncertainties in 2h and 18o of precipitation, and the understanding of their interrelation with weather patterns are essential for a better past, present and future environmental and climatic modelling at both local and regional scales.",

    "abstract": "sepsis is a complex biphasic syndrome characterized by both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune states. whereas early sepsis mortality is caused by an acute, deleterious pro-inflammatory response, the second sepsis phase is governed by acute immunosuppression, which predisposes patients to long-term risk for life-threatening secondary infections. despite extensive basic research and clinical trials, there is to date no specific therapy for sepsis, and mortality rates are on the rise. although ifn- is one of the most-studied cytokines, its diverse effects are not fully understood. depending on the disease or type of infection, it can have beneficial or detrimental effects. as ifn- has been used successfully to treat diverse diseases, emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of ifn- in sepsis. analyses of mouse models of septic shock attribute a pro-inflammatory role to ifn- in sepsis development. as anti-inflammatory treatments in humans with antibodies to tnf- or il1- resulted disappointing, cytokine modulation approaches were discouraged and neutralization of ifn- has not been pursued for sepsis treatment. in the case of patients with delayed sepsis and immunosuppression, there is a debate as to whether the use of specific cytokines would restore the deactivated immune response. recent reports show an association of low ifn- levels with the hyporesponsive state of monocytes from sepsis patients and after endotoxin tolerance induction. these data, discussed here, project a role for ifn- in restoring monocyte function and reversing immunosuppression, and suggest ifn--based additive immunomodulatory therapy. the dichotomy in putative therapeutic approaches, involving reduction or an increase in ifn- levels, mirrors the contrasting nature of the early hyperinflammatory state and the delayed immunosuppression phase.",

    "abstract": "context epidemiological studies and animal research have suggested that air pollution may negatively impact the central nervous system (cns). controlled human exposure studies of the effect of air pollution on the brain have potential to enhance our understanding of this relationship and to inform potential biological mechanisms. objectives biomarkers of systemic and cns inflammation may address whether air pollution exposure induces inflammation, with potential for cns negative effects. materials and methods twenty-seven healthy adults were exposed to two conditions: filtered air (fa) and diesel exhaust (de) (300 g pm2.5/m(3)) for 120 min, in a double-blinded crossover study with exposures separated by four weeks. prior to and at 0, 3, and 24 h following each exposure, serum and plasma were collected and analyzed for inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (il-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-), the astrocytic protein s100b, the neuronal cytoplasmic enzyme neuron-specific enolase (nse), and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf). we hypothesized that il-6, tnf-, s100b and nse would increase, and bdnf would decrease, following de exposure. results at no time-point following exposure to de was a significant increase in concentration from baseline seen for il-6, tnf-, s100b, or nse relative to fa exposure. similarly, no significant decrease in bdnf concentration from baseline was seen following de exposure, relative to fa. furthermore, the repeated measures anova considered for all time-points and biomarkers revealed no significant time-exposure interaction. discussion and conclusion these results suggest that short-term exposure to de amongst healthy adults does not acutely affect the systemic or cns biomarkers that we measured.",

    "abstract": "analytical methods used for pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in sewage play a fundamental role in wastewater-based epidemiology (wbe) studies. here quantitative analysis of drug metabolites in raw wastewaters is used to determine consumption from general population. its great advantage in public health studies is that it gives objective, real-time data about community use of chemicals, highlighting the relationship between environmental and human health. within a wbe study on salbutamol use in a large population, we developed a procedure to distinguish human metabolic excretion from external source of contamination, possibly industrial, in wastewaters. salbutamol is mainly excreted as the sulphate metabolite, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to the parent compound in the environment, so this is currently not detected. when a molecule is either excreted un-metabolized or its metabolites are unstable in the environment, studies can be completed by monitoring the parent compound. in this case it is mandatory to assess whether the drug in wastewater is present because of population use or because of a specific source of contamination, such as industrial manufacturing waste. because commercial salbutamol mainly occurs as a racemic mixture and is stereoselective in the human metabolism, the enantiomeric relative fraction (efrel) in wastewater samples should reflect excretion, being unbalanced towards one of two enantiomers, if the drug is of metabolic origin. the procedure described involves chiral analysis of the salbutamol enantiomers by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms-ms) and calculation of efrel, to detect samples where external contamination occurs. samples were collected daily between october and december 2013 from the milano nosedo wastewater treatment plant. carbamazepine and atenolol were measured in the sewage collector, as \"control\" drugs. salbutamol efrel was highly consistent in all samples during this three-month period, but a limited number of samples had unexpectedly high concentrations where the efrel was close to that observed of the un-metabolized, commercially available drug, supporting the idea of an external source of contamination, besides human metabolic excretion. results showed that, when present, non-metabolic daily loads could be evaluated indicating an average of 4.12g/day of salbutamol extra load due to non-metabolic sources. the stereoselectivity in metabolism and enantiomeric ratio analysis appears to be a useful approach in wbe studies to identify different sources of drugs in the environment, when no metabolic products are present at useful analytical levels.",

    "abstract": "background the vitreous has been shown to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation because it induces fibroblast-like morphology, enhanced migration and invasion in retinal pigment epithelial cells in proliferative vitreoretinopathy. rac1 is the principal mediator of cell migration. in the current study, the relationship between rac1 and cell migration, and invasion in vitreous-transformed retinal pigment epithelial cells was investigated using nsc23766, a specific inhibitor of rac guanosine-5'-triphosphatase activity, and the involvement of a rac1 guanosine-5'-triphosphatase-dependent pathway was detected. design one-way design with multiple levels and repeated measurement design. participants and samples the vitreous humor was collected from 20 healthy donor eyes and the retinal pigment epithelial cells were obtained from 9 healthy donor eyes. methods human low-passage retinal pigment epithelial cells were treated with normal medium or 25% vitreous medium. rac1 activity was measured using a pull-down assay. the cytotoxicity of nsc23766 was measured using the trypan blue dye exclusion test. cell migration was measured using a wound healing assay. cell invasion was determined using a transwell invasion assay. protein expression of rac1 and phosphorylation of lim kinase 1 and cofilin were detected by western blot analysis. main outcome measures cell migration, invasion, rac1 activity and phosphorylation of lim kinase 1 and cofilin. results rac1guanosine-5'-triphosphatase was activated in vitreous-transformed retinal pigment epithelial cells. a rac inhibitor suppressed vitreous-induced migration and invasion in retinal pigment epithelial cells. cofilin phosphorylation was activated by vitreous treatment but blocked by nsc23766. conclusions rac1 mediates vitreous-transformed retinal pigment epithelial cells' plasticity of mesenchymal movement via rac1 guanosine-5'-triphosphatase-dependent pathways that modulate lim kinase 1 and cofilin activity. rac inhibition may be considered a novel treatment for proliferative vitreoretinopathy.",

    "abstract": "nitric oxide (no) plays a dual role in response to neural hypoxia. no is synthesized by three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (nos), among which the neuronal nos (nnos) is predominant in the nervous system. hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (hif-1) is a transcription factor that is induced under hypoxic conditions, but its correlation with nnos remains unclear. in the present study, we aimed at clarifying the regulation pattern of the nnos expression in response to cobalt chloride (cocl2), a widely used chemical mimic of hypoxia, and the role of hif-1 in this process in neuroblastoma cells. we found cocl2 evidently increased the nnos expression and no production in human neuroblastoma sk-n-sh cells, but the effect of cocl2 on no was partially abrogated by 7-nitroindazole, a selective inhibitor for nnos. importantly, we identified a hypoxia response element (hre) within the nnos promoter, to which hif-1 may bind, and cocl2 greatly enhanced the hif-1 expression and its binding to the hre. meanwhile, we demonstrated that this hre was functionally important for the activation of the nnos transcription, and cocl2 increased the transcriptional activity of the nnos promoter through this hre. taken together, our study shows that cocl2 may induce the nnos expression and no production through a hif-1 mechanism in neuroblastoma cells, which may provide a potential target for the treatment of neurological hypoxic disorders caused by no dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "current hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotyping techniques are often highly technical, costly, or need improvements in sensitivity and specificity. these limitations indicate the need of novel methods for hcv genotyping. the present study aimed to develop a novel genotyping method combining high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis with bayes discriminant analysis (bda). target gene fragment including 5'-untranslated and core region was selected. four or five inner amplicons for every serum were amplified using nested pcr, hrm was used to determine the melting temperature of the amplicons, and hcv genotypes were then analyzed utilizing bda. in initial genotyping (hcv genotypes were classified into 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, and 6a), both the overall accuracy rate and the cross-validation accuracy rate were 92.6%, external validation accuracy rate was 95.0%. to enhance the accuracy rate of genotyping, hcv genotypes were firstly classified into 1b, 3a, 3b, and 2a-6a, followed by a supplementary genotyping for 2a-6a. both the overall accuracy rate and the cross-validation accuracy rate reached 97.5%, and external validation accuracy rate was 100%. comparing adjusted hrm genotyping with type-specific probe technique, the difference in accuracy rates was not significant. however, the limit of detection and cost were lower for hrm. comparing with sequencing, the limit detection of hrm was the same as the former, but the cost of hrm was lower. hence, hrm combined with bda was a novel method that equipped with superior accuracy, high sensitivity, and lower cost and therefore could be a better technique for hcv genotyping.",

    "abstract": "cd14+cd16+ monocytes transmigrate into the cns of hiv-positive people in response to chemokines elevated in the brains of infected individuals, including cxcl12. entry of these cells leads to viral reservoirs, neuroinflammation, and neuronal damage. these may eventually lead to hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders. although antiretroviral therapy (art) has significantly improved the lives of hiv-infected people, the prevalence of cognitive deficits remains unchanged despite art, still affecting >50% of infected individuals. there are no therapies to reduce these deficits or to prevent cns entry of cd14+cd16+ monocytes. the goal of this study was to determine whether cxcr7, a receptor for cxcl12, is expressed on cd14+cd16+ monocytes and whether a small molecule cxcr7 antagonist (ccx771) can prevent cd14+cd16+ monocyte transmigration into the cns. we showed for the first time that cxcr7 is on cd14+cd16+ monocytes and that it may be a therapeutic target to reduce their entry into the brain. we demonstrated that cd14+cd16+ monocytes and not the more abundant cd14+cd16- monocytes or t cells transmigrate to low homeostatic levels of cxcl12. this may be a result of increased cxcr7 on cd14+cd16+ monocytes. we showed that ccx771 reduced transmigration of cd14+cd16+ monocytes but not of cd14+cd16- monocytes from uninfected and hiv-infected individuals and that it reduced cxcl12-mediated chemotaxis of cd14+cd16+ monocytes. we propose that cxcr7 is a therapeutic target on cd14+cd16+ monocytes to limit their cns entry, thereby reducing neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders. our data also suggest that ccx771 may reduce cd14+cd16+ monocyte-mediated inflammation in other disorders.",

    "abstract": "in macaque, several visual areas are devoted to analyze motion in the visual field, and v6 is one of these areas. in macaque, area v6 occupies the ventral part of the anterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus (pos), is retinotopically-organized and contains a point-to-point representation of the retinal surface. v6 is a motion sensitive area that largely represents the peripheral part of the visual field and whose cells are very sensitive to translational motion. based on the fact that macaque v6 contains many real-motion cells, it has been suggested that v6 is involved in object-motion recognition. recently, area v6 has been recognized also in the human brain by neuroimaging and electrophysiological methods. like macaque v6, human v6 is located in the pos, is retinotopically organized, and represents the entire contralateral hemifield up to the far periphery. human v6, like macaque v6, is a motion area that responds to unidirectional motion. it has a strong preference for coherent motion and a recent combined veps/fmri work has shown that area v6 is even one of the most early stations coding the motion coherence. human v6 is highly sensitive to flow field and is also able to distinguish between different 3d flow fields being selective to translational egomotion. this suggests that this area processes visual egomotion signals to extract information about the relative distance of objects, likely in order to act on them, or to avoid them. the view that v6 is involved in the estimation of egomotion has been tested also in other recent fmri studies. thus, taken together, human and macaque data suggest that v6 is involved in both object and self-motion recognition. specifically, v6 could be involved in \"subtracting out\" self-motion signals across the whole visual field and in providing information about moving objects, particularly during self-motion in a complex and dynamically unstable environment.",

    "abstract": "human populations in many countries have undergone a phase of demographic transition, characterized by a major reduction in fertility at a time of increased resource availability. a key stylized fact is that the reduction in fertility is preceded by a reduction in mortality and a consequent increase in population density. various theories have been proposed to account for the demographic transition process, including maladaptation, increased parental investment in fewer offspring, and cultural evolution. none of these approaches, including formal cultural evolutionary models of the demographic transitions, have addressed a possible direct causal relationship between a reduction in mortality and the subsequent decline in fertility. we provide mathematical models in which low mortality favours the cultural selection of low-fertility traits. this occurs because reduced mortality slows turnover in the model, which allows the cultural transmission advantage of low-fertility traits to outrace their reproductive disadvantage. for mortality to be a crucial determinant of outcome, a cultural transmission bias is required where slow reproducers exert higher social influence. computer simulations of our models that allow for exogenous variation in the death rate can reproduce the central features of the demographic transition process, including substantial reductions in fertility within only one to three generations. a model assuming continuous evolution of reproduction rates through imitation errors predicts fertility to fall below replacement levels if death rates are sufficiently low. this can potentially explain the very low preferred family sizes in western europe.",

    "abstract": "chikungunya is a vector borne disease that spreads quickly in geographically affected areas. its outbreak results in acute illness that may lead to chronic phase. chikungunya virus (chv) diagnosis solutions are not easily accessible and affordable in developing countries. also old approaches are very slow in identifying and controlling the spread of chv outbreak. the sudden development and advancement of wearable internet of things (iot) sensors, fog computing, mobile technology, cloud computing and better internet coverage have enhanced the quality of remote healthcare services. iot assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to identify possibly infected users from chv in an early phase of their illness so that the outbreak of chv can be controlled. fog computing provides many benefits such as low latency, minimum response time, high mobility, enhanced service quality, location awareness and notification service itself at the edge of the network. in this paper, iot and fog based healthcare system is proposed to identify and control the outbreak of chv. fuzzy-c means (fcm) is used to diagnose the possibly infected users and immediately generate diagnostic and emergency alerts to users from fog layer. furthermore on cloud server, social network analysis (sna) is used to represent the state of chv outbreak. outbreak role index is calculated from sna graph which represents the probability of any user to receive or spread the infection. it also generates warning alerts to government and healthcare agencies to control the outbreak of chv in risk prone or infected regions. the experimental results highlight the advantages of using both fog computing and cloud computing services together for achieving network bandwidth efficiency, high quality of service and minimum response time in generation of real time notification as compared to a cloud only model.",

    "abstract": "ethno-pharmacological relevance kyllinga brevifolia rhizomes (cyperaceae) are used in paraguayan traditional medicine as a refreshing beverage, and is claimed to own digestive, diuretic, sedative, tonic, antispasmodic and sudorific properties. we have previously reported that its hydro- ethanolic rhizome extract possess sedative, anxiolytic and anti-aggressive-like effects in mice. however, information on its potential for treatment of syndromes associated with mood disorders is scarce. aim of the study the purpose of this study is to characterize the putative antidepressant-like effects of the hydro-ethanolic extract (cekb) and the ethyl acetate fraction (kbf-ethyl-ac) obtained from the rhizome of k. brevifolia (rottb) on male mice exposed to forced swimming test. also, chemical characterization of the components of the active ethyl acetate fraction was described. materials and methods the antidepressant-like effects of cekb and kbf-ethyl-ac were measured using the forced swimming test (fst) performance of male mice in single (acute), short-term and chronic modalities. treatments in all modalities were made 1h before swimming test. the kbf-ethyl-ac was analyzed by lc-dad-esi-ms and lc-esi-ms/ms in order to identify the active components. results a single doses (1.0, 10.0 and 100.0mg/kg, p.o; p<0.05) of cekb, in male mice provoked a significant reduction of the immobility time. such effect was also observed with oral short-term treatment (7 days) with doses of 10.0 and 100.0mg/kg/day (p<0.05) of cekb. moreover, in the treatments during 14 days with doses of 1.0 (p<0.05), 10.0 (p<0.05), and 100.0 (p<0.001) mg/kg, p.o, of cekb, a statistically significant reduction of the immobility time were induced. additionally, in a different set of experiments acute dose of 1.0 (p<0.05) and 10.0 (p<0.01) mg/kg, p.o, of kbf-ethyl-ac in male mice, a significant reduction of the immobility time were provoked. likewise, short-term treatment (7 days) with 1.0, and 10.0mg/kg (p<0.05); and after 14 days of treatment with 0.01 (p<0.01) 0.1 (p<0.001), 1.0 (p<0.001), and 10.0 (p<0.05) mg/kg of kbf-ethyl-ac in male mice, a statistically significant reduction of the immobility time, were observed. imipramine 32mg/kg/days, i.p, induced a statistically significant reduction of immobility time and was used as positive control to validate the method employed. moreover, it was noted important differences in the onset of the antidepressant-like effect in the fst, depending on the modality of treatment with cekb or kbf-ethyl-ac (acute, short-term or chronic). both, efficacy and potency were higher when repeated administration of cekb was used, and surprisingly the efficacy of 1.0mg/kg of kbf-ethyl-ac (14 days) was similar to imipramine. the main constituents of the kbf-ethyl-ac were identified as catechins and their dimers by lc-dad-esi-ms and lc-esi-ms/ms, according to their uv and ms spectra, as compared with the literature data. these results indicate an important antidepressant-like profile of action for the cekb and kbf-ethyl-ac; and meanwhile, this effect may partially reside on catechins and their dimers isolated from the kbf-ethyl-ac. conclusion these findings indicate that k. brevifolia exerts antidepressant -like effects in mice and suggest its potential usefulness for the treatment of depression in humans and encourage us to pursue the isolation of the molecules associated to the effect observed in cekb and kbf-ethyl-ac, and to determine the mechanism of antidepressant-like effect of kyllinga brevifolia using adequate complementary test.",

    "abstract": "due to the wide-presence of organic amines in natural waters, organic chloramines are commonly formed during (pre-)chlorination. with the increasing application of uv disinfection in water treatment, both the activation mechanism of organic chloramine by uv photolysis and its subsequent impact on water quality are not clear. using sarcosine (sar) as an amine group-containing compound, it was found that organic chloramines (i.e., cl-sar) would be firstly formed during chlorination even in the presence of natural organic matter. compared with self-decay of cl-sar, uv photolysis accelerated cl-sar decomposition and induced ncl bond cleavage. using metoprolol (mtp) as a model micro-pollutant, uv-activated cl-sar (uv/cl-sar) can accelerate micro-pollutant degradation, attributed to reactive radicals formation. ho and cl were important contributors, with a total contribution of 45%64%. moreover, the degradation rate of mtp by uv/cl-sar was ph-dependent, which monotonically increased from 0.044 to 0.065 min1 under phs 5.58.5. although the activation of organic chloramine by uv could accelerate micro-pollutant degradation, uv/cl-sar treatment could also enhance disinfection by-products formation. trichloromethane (tcm) formation was observed during mtp degradation by uv/cl-sar. after post-chlorination, tcm, 1,1-dichloropropanone, 1,1,1-trichloropropanone, and dichloroacetonitrile were detected. their individual and total concentrations were all positively proportional to uv/cl-sar treatment time. the total concentration with 30min treatment (66.93g l1) was about 2.3 times that with 1min treatment (28.76g l1). finally, the accelerated effect was verified with cl-glycine and cl-alanine. it is expected to unravel the non-negligible role of organic chloramine on water quality during uv disinfection.",

    "title": "non-adaptive territory selection by a bird with exceptionally long parental care.",
    "abstract": "high-quality territories are expected to provide greater fitness return for breeding individuals and, thus, are likely to have higher long-term occupation rate in comparison to low-quality territories. however, if environmental and ecological cues used for territory selection cannot reliably predict true territory quality, a mismatch between preferences and fitness may occur. we suggest that this kind of non-adaptive territory selection is more likely in species with long reproductive cycles, as a long time interval between territory establishment and young fledgling should reduce predictability of conditions during the critical stages of brood care. in this study, we investigated adaptiveness of territory selection in a migratory bird with exceptionally long parental care, the mute swan cygnus olor, which requires over four months to complete the entire reproductive cycle from egg laying to young fledging. for this purpose, we collected information on the long-term (10-19 years) occupancy of 222 swan breeding territories and correlated it with reproductive performance (n = 1,345 breeding attempts) and body condition of breeding adults. we found that long-term occupancy positively correlated with the timing of breeding, suggesting that individuals settled earlier in the attractive, frequently occupied territories. by contrast, we found no relationship between territory occupancy and reproductive output (hatching and fledging success) or adult body condition. the results indicate that at the time of territory selection swans might not be able to reliably assess territory quality, likely due to: (1) exceptionally long period of parental care, which reduces temporal correlation between the conditions at the time of territory selection and conditions during chick rearing; and (2) unpredictability of human-related activities that had a major impact on reproductive output of swan pairs in our population.",

    "abstract": "ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer fatalities among american women. although curable at early stages with surgery, most women are diagnosed with symptoms of late-stage metastatic disease. moreover, none of the current diagnostic techniques are clinically recommended for at-risk women as they preferentially target low-grade tumors (which do not affect longevity) and fail to capture early signatures of more lethal serous tumors which originate in the fimbrae region of the fallopian tubes. hence, the early detection of ovarian cancer is challenging given the current strategy. recently, our group has developed a novel optical imaging technique, partial wave spectroscopic (pws) microscopy, that can quantify the nanoscale macromolecular density fluctuations within biological cells via a biomarker, disorder strength (ld ). using the concept of field carcinogenesis, we propose a method of detecting ovarian cancer by pws assessment of endometrial and endocervical columnar cells. the study includes 26 patients (controls=15, cancer=11) for endometrium and 23 (controls=13, cancer=10) for endocervix. our results highlight a significant increase in ld (% fold-increase>50%, p-value<0.05) for columnar epithelial cells obtained from cancer patients compared to controls for both endocervix and endometrium. overall, the quantification of field carcinogenic events in the endometrium and the novel observation of its extension to the cervix are unique findings in the understanding of ovarian field carcinogenesis. we further show independent validation of the presence of cervical field carcinogenesis with micro-rna expression data.",

    "abstract": "this work explores the effect of persulfate (ps) on the sonochemical degradation of organic pollutants taking naphthol blue black (nbb), an anionic diazo dye, as a substrate model. the sonolytic experiments were conducted in the absence and presence of ps under various experimental conditions including acoustic power (10-80w), frequency (20 and 585khz) and saturating gas (argon, air and nitrogen). experimental results showed that ps decomposition into sulfate radical (so4-) takes place by sonolysis and increasing ps concentration up to 1g/l would result in an increase in the nbb degradation rate. it was found that the ps-enhanced effect was strongly operating parameters dependent. the positive effect of ps decreased with increasing power and the best enhancing effect was obtained for the lowest acoustic power. correspondingly, the ps-enhanced effect was more remarkable at low frequency (20khz) than that observed at high frequency ultrasound (585khz). nitrogen saturating gas gave the best enhanced effect of ps than argon and air atmospheres. theoretical (computer simulation of bubble collapse) and experimental measurements of the yields of free radical generation under the different experimental conditions have been made for interpreting the obtained effects of ps on the sonochemical degradation of the dye pollutant. the experimental findings were attributed to the fact that radical-radical recombination reactions occur at faster rate than the radical-organic reaction when the concentration of free radicals is too high (at higher sonochemical conditions).",

    "abstract": "radiation therapy represents one of the primary treatment modalities for primary and metastatic brain tumors. although recent advances in radiation techniques, that allow the delivery of higher radiation doses to the target volume, reduce the toxicity to normal tissues, long-term neurocognitive decline is still a detrimental factor significantly affecting quality of life, particularly in pediatric patients. this imposes the need for the development of prevention strategies. based on recent evidence, showing that manipulation of the shh pathway carries therapeutic potential for brain repair and functional recovery after injury, here we evaluate how radiation-induced hippocampal alterations are modulated by the constitutive activation of the shh signaling pathway in patched 1 heterozygous mice (ptch1+/-). our results show, for the first time, an overall protective effect of constitutive shh pathway activation on hippocampal radiation injury. this activation, through modulation of the proneural gene network, leads to a long-term reduction of hippocampal deficits in the stem cell and new neuron compartments and to the mitigation of radio-induced astrogliosis, despite some behavioral alterations still being detected in ptch1+/- mice. a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neural decline following irradiation is essential for identifying prevention measures to contain the harmful consequences of irradiation. our data have important translational implications as they suggest a role for shh pathway manipulation to provide the therapeutic possibility of improving brain repair and functional recovery after radio-induced injury.",

    "abstract": "fall risk assessment is very important for the graying societies of developed countries. a major contributor to the fall risk of the elderly is mobility impairment. timely detection of the fall risk can facilitate early intervention to avoid preventable falls. however, continuous fall risk monitoring requires extensive healthcare and clinical resources. our objective is to develop a method suitable for remote and long-term health monitoring of the elderly for mobility impairment and fall risk without the need for an expert. we employed time-frequency analysis (tfa) and a stacked autoencoder (sae), which is a deep neural network (dnn)-based learning algorithm, to assess the mobility and fall risk of the elderly according to the criteria of the timed up and go test (tug). the time series signal of the triaxial accelerometer can be transformed by tfa to obtain richer image information. on the basis of the tug criteria, the semi-supervised sae model was able to achieve high predictive accuracies of 89.1, 93.4, and 94.1% for the vertical, mediolateral and anteroposterior axes, respectively. we believe that deep learning can be used to analyze triaxial acceleration data, and our work demonstrates its applicability to assessing the mobility and fall risk of the elderly.",

    "abstract": "this study aims to identify the histological basis for the extraordinary, fast movement of the style in marantaceae. although this explosive pollination mechanism was subject of many studies, quantitative measurements to document volumetric changes have never been conducted. based on physical parameters and limitations (poroelastic time), the movement itself is by far too fast to be explained by turgor changes solely. therefore, we address the hypothesis that the style contains elastic structures to store energy allowing the fast movement. we provide an experimental approach in goeppertia bachemiana to identify histological differences of styles in various states, i.e., steady, unreleased, and released state. cross and longitudinal sections were used to reconstruct the cell volume in different sectors of the style. histological data were discussed with respect to a putative water shift (turgor movement) and elastic instabilities that were proposed to explain the style movement of marantaceae. current data show, that the upper epidermis is under tensile stress in the unreleased state. after style release, the lower side of the style revealed an enormous water up-take. according to our results, we hypothesize that the fast style movement of g. bachemiana is likely based on an elastically stretched upper epidermis, whereas a \"soaking tissue\" at the lower side presumably mediates the up curling of the style. the experimental data show that at least for g. bachemiana, physical limitations such as the poroelastic time are suitable parameters to predict movements that are based on elastic instabilities.",

    "abstract": "the dysregulation of cellular metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism, is essential for cancer progress. monoglyceride lipase (mgll) is an important fatty acid metabolism enzyme, which converts monoacylglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. despite the expression level of mgll was reported to be downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), the clinical significances and molecular mechanism of mgll downregulation remains unknown. in the current study, the clinical significances of mgll expression were investigated in 95 patients with hcc and the transcription factors of mgll were identified in hcc cells. we found that mgll was frequently downregulated in hcc samples, especially in metastatic tumor tissues. patients with low mgll expression owned remarkably lower 5 year-overall survival (5-os). functionally, we found that mgll played an important role in hcc cell migration. overexpression of mgll suppressed cell migration and depletion of mgll by shrna promoted cell migration. further studies indicated that klf4 directly bound to the promoter of mgll and accelerated mgll expression, which then led to hcc cell migration decrease. additionally, the expression levels of klf4 were positive association with mgll expression in hcc tissues. collectively, our data suggest that klf4 is a key regulator of mgll. the klf4-mgll axis plays an essential role in suppressing hcc cell migration.",

    "abstract": "nitric oxide (no) can be generated endogenously via no synthases or via the diet following the action of symbiotic nitrate-reducing bacteria in the oral cavity. given the important role of no in smooth muscle control there is an intriguing suggestion that cardiovascular homeostasis may be intertwined with the presence of these bacteria. here, we measured the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria in the oral cavity of 25 healthy humans using 16s rrna sequencing and observed, for 3.5h, the physiological responses to dietary nitrate ingestion via measurement of blood pressure, and salivary and plasma no metabolites. we identified 7 species of bacteria previously known to contribute to nitrate-reduction, the most prevalent of which were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella dispar. following dietary nitrate supplementation, blood pressure was reduced and salivary and plasma nitrate and nitrite increased substantially. we found that the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria was associated with the generation of salivary nitrite but not with any other measured variable. to examine the impact of bacterial abundance on pharmacokinetics we also categorised our participants into two groups; those with a higher abundance of nitrate reducing bacteria (> 50%), and those with a lower abundance (< 50%). salivary nitrite production was lower in participants with lower abundance of bacteria and these individuals also exhibited slower salivary nitrite pharmacokinetics. we therefore show that the rate of nitrate to nitrite reduction in the oral cavity is associated with the abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria. nevertheless, higher abundance of these bacteria did not result in an exaggerated plasma nitrite response, the best known marker of no bioavailability. these data from healthy young adults suggest that the abundance of oral nitrate-reducing bacteria does not influence the generation of no through the diet, at least when the host has a functional minimum threshold of these microorganisms.",
