    "abstract": "objects associated with reward draw attention and evoke enhanced activity in visual cortex. what is the underlying mechanism? one possibility is that reward's impact on vision is mediated by unique circuitry that modulates sensory processing, selectively increasing the salience of reward-associated stimuli. alternatively, effects of reward may be part of a more general mechanism that prioritizes the processing of any beneficial object, importantly including stimuli that are associated with the evasion of loss. here, we test these competing hypotheses by having male and female humans detect naturalistic objects associated with monetary reward, the evasion of equivalent loss, or neither of these. if vision is economically normative, processing of objects associated with reward and evasion of loss should be prioritized relative to neutral stimuli. results from fmri and behavioral experiments show that this is not the case: whereas objects associated with reward were better detected and represented in ventral visual cortex, detection and representation of stimuli associated with the evasion of loss were degraded. representations in parietal cortex reveal a notable exception to this pattern, showing enhanced encoding of both reward- and loss-associated stimuli. experience-driven visual prioritization can thus be economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.significance statement normative economic models propose that gain should have the same value as evasion of equivalent loss. is human vision rational in this way? objects associated with reward draw attention and are well represented in visual cortex. this is thought to have evolutionary origins, highlighting objects likely to provide benefit in the future. but benefit can be conferred not only through gain, but also through evasion of loss. here we demonstrate that the visual system prioritizes real-world objects presented in images of natural scenes only when these objects have been associated with reward, not when they have provided the opportunity to evade financial loss. visual selection is thus non-normative and economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.",

    "abstract": "cell aggregates, or spheroids, have been used as building blocks to fabricate scaffold-free tissues that can closely mimic the native three-dimensional in vivo environment for broad applications including regenerative medicine and high throughput testing of drugs. the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) into spheroids permits the manipulation of spheroids into desired shapes, patterns, and tissues using magnetic forces. current strategies incorporating mnps often involve cellular uptake, and should therefore be avoided because it induces adverse effects on cell activity, viability, and phenotype. here, we report a janus structure of magnetic cellular spheroids (jmcs) with spatial control of mnps to form two distinct domains: cells and extracellular mnps. this separation of cells and mnps within magnetic cellular spheroids was successfully incorporated into cellular spheroids with various cellular and extracellular compositions and contents. the amount of cells that internalized mnps was quantified and showed that jmcss resulted in significantly lower internalization (35%) compared to uptake spheroids (83%, p < 0.05). furthermore, the addition of mnps to cellular spheroids using the janus method has no adverse effects on cellular viability up to seven weeks, with spheroids maintaining at least 82% viability over 7 weeks when compared to control spheroids without mnps. by safely incorporating mnps into cellular spheroids, results demonstrated that jmcss were capable of magnetic manipulation, and that magnetic forces used during magnetic force assembly mediate fusion into controlled patterns and complex tissues. finally, jmcss were assembled and fused into a vascular tissue construct 5 mm in diameter using magnetic force assembly.",

    "abstract": "electronic health record (ehr) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. although ehr researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. for example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. we study whether ehr research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. we show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. we perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. in the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. the second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. in the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. we conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. we observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). aggregating ehr data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale ehr analyses. this paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases.",

    "abstract": "cellular prion protein (prpc), the infective agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, is thought to be related to several cellular physiological and physiopathological processes. we have previously reported that prpc participates in multi-drug-resistance of gastric cancer. as the salient ligand molecule of prp for participating in internalization and propagation of the scrapie form of prion protein (prpsc), 37 kda laminin receptor precursor protein (37lrp) shared the same gene coding sequence of mgr1-ag, another protein previously found to be involved in multi-drug-resistance of gastric cancer in our lab. in the present study, we explored whether mgr1-ag/37lrp contributed to prpc mediated multi-drug-resistance in gastric cancer. immunohistochemical staining showed similar expression patterns of mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer tissue serial sections. western blot and immunohistochemistry also demonstrated correlative expression of mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer cell lines. interaction between mgr1-ag/37lrp and prpc in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues were verified by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. furthermore, knockdown of mgr1-ag/37lrp significantly attenuated prpc induced multi-drug-resistance by sensitizing drug-induced apoptosis through inhibition of akt activation. in conclusion, mgr1-ag/37lrp may interact with prpc and promote the prpc induced multi-drug-resistance in gastric cancer through pi3k/akt pathway. the current study elucidates the mechanism of how prpc triggers intracellular signaling cascade resulting in multi-drug-resistance phenotype and provides a novel candidate molecular target against gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "a model linking within- and between-host pathogen dynamics via pathogen shedding (emission of pathogens throughout the course of infection) is developed, and several aspects of host availability and co-infection are considered. in this model, the rate of pathogen shedding affects both the pathogen population size within a host (also affecting host mortality) and the rate of infection of new hosts. our goal is to ascertain how the rate of shedding is likely to evolve, and what factors permit coexistence of alternative shedding rates in a pathogen population. for a constant host population size (where an increase in infected hosts necessarily decreases susceptible hosts), important differences arise depending on whether pathogens compete only for susceptible (uninfected) hosts, or whether co-infection allows for competition for infected hosts. with no co-infection, the pathogen type that can persist with the lowest number of susceptible hosts will outcompete any other, which under the assumptions of the model is the pathogen with the highest basic reproduction number. this is often a pathogen with a relatively high shedding rate (s). if within-host competition is allowed, a trade-off develops due to the conflicting effects of shedding on within- and between-host pathogen dynamics, with within-host competition favoring clones with low shedding rates while between-host competition benefits clones with higher shedding rates. with within-host competition for the same host cells, low shedding rate clones should eliminate high-s clones in a co-infected host, if equilibrium is reached. with co-infection, but no within-host competition, pathogen clones still interact by affecting the mortality of co-infected hosts; here, coexistence is more likely. with co-infection, two clones can coexist if one is the superior competitor for uninfected hosts and the other for co-infected hosts.",

    "abstract": "introduction angina is the cardinal symptom of chronic coronary syndrome (ccs), which is the leading cause of death worldwide. as such, the control of angina is important. the current guidelines recommend beta blockers (bb) or calcium channel blockers to reduce angina, yet many patients with stable angina remain symptomatic. it has been suggested that combining trimetazidine (tmz), an anti-ischemic agent, with a bb is beneficial for symptomatic patients. bisoprolol, a bb, is often used to treat patients with ccs, yet no data are currently available regarding the efficacy of bisoprolol combined with tmz in patients who remain symptomatic despite receiving bisoprolol. methods the aim of this post-hoc analysis of the choice-2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tmz 35mg twice daily in combination with different bisoprolol doses in symptomatic patients with stable angina patients receiving hemodynamic therapy in a real-world clinical setting. results this analysis involved 221 patients (mean [ standard deviation] age 64.88.9 years) with stable angina. the mean number of weekly angina episodes gradually fell from 6.25.3 at inclusion (m0) to 1.51.9 at 6months after treatment initiation (m6) with combined tmz-bisoprolol therapy (p<0.001). the number of patients assessed to be angina-free increased almost sixfold from 5.4% (12/221) at m0 to 33.9% (74/221) at m6. exercise capacity improved, as measured by walking distance, from 308207m at m0 to 497253m at m6 (p<0.05). the number of patients with canadian cardiovascular society class 1 angina increased by tenfold during the study, whereas those with class 3 angina decreased by threefold. conclusion the tmz-bisoprolol combination is a rapidly effective treatment for reducing the frequency of angina attacks and the use of short-acting nitrates in patients with stable angina in a real-world clinical setting. the benefits of this combination therapy was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment initiation and the treatment was well tolerated. trial registration isrctn identifier: isrctn65209863.",
